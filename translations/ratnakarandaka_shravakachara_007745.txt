 PREFACE The Glory of Acurya Samantabhadra Acarya Samantabhadra was a great
Digambara ascetic endowed A with exceptional knowledge of the Jaina doctrine. He
preached and propagated, far and wide, core principles of the doctrine by
visiting many places in India. His literary and philosophical talents are not
open to dispute; many inscriptions and works by subsequent Jaina Acaryas have
extolled his virtues as well as his works in superlative terms. A case in point
is the assertion by Acarya Jinasena in Adipuranal: namaH samantabhadrAya mahate
kavivedhase  /  4&104 FAYHT: 040184: 1143 11 I bow to Acarya Samantrabhadra, the
ultimate creator (Brahma) among all poets, whose words are like a stroke of
lightning which tears apart mountains of misconceptions. kavInAM gamakAnAM ca

Samantrabhadra's glory reigned supreme among all poets, scholars, disputants,
and preachers; he was like a jewel on their heads. Four exceptional qualities of
Acarya Samantabhadra have been mentioned: 1) poetic skill (kavitva) which made
his compositions excellent in terms of profoundness of content and grandiosity
of expression; 2) intellectual authority (gamakatva) because of which he was
able to explore and expound deep meanings of profound religious texts; 3)
debating skill (vaditva) which made him capable of reasoning out the most
difficult philosophical disputes; and 4) charming (viii)

and straightforwardness even in the minds of his adversaries. Acarya

Only when the inauspicious (asubha) karmas of a man get to quiescence is he able
to come face-to-face with the holy words of Acarya Samantrabhadra. Those who
fail to adopt the path of piety even after exposure to his words can only be
said to have been overwhelmed by delusion. Acarya Samantabhadra has not only
been termed a brilliant grammarian, logician and philosopher, he has been
recognized as an unmatched disputant, and a great preacher of the Jaina
doctrine. Acarya Subhacandra in Jnanarnavah3 has likened the poetic compositions
of Svami Samantabhadra to the bright rays of the sun. Acarya Jinasena, author of
Harivansapurana4, has likened the expositions of Acarya Samantabhadra to the
words of Lord Mahavira: jIvasiddhividhAyIha kRtayuktyanuzAsanam  /  29: 44746

======================
 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara (discourse on the path to liberation) and
Yuktyanusasana (discourse on the merits and demerits of different standpoints),
carry the same glory as the words of Lord Mahavira. It is mentioned in Jaina
literature5 that Acarya Samantabhadra once introduced himself to the king of
Varanasi as: (x) AcAryo'haM kavirahamahaM vAdirAT paNDito'ham, daivajJo'haM
bhiSagahamahaM mAntrikastAntriko'ham  /  rAjannasyAM
jaladhivalayAmekhalAyAmilAyA mAjJAsiddhaH kimiti bahunA siddhasArasvato'ham  /
/  O king! I am a preceptor (acarya), a poet (kavi), foremost among the
interpreters of the sacred scriptures (vadi), a scholar (pandita), an astrologer
(jyotisi), a practitioner of medicine (vaidya), a reciter of spells (mantrika),
and skilled in mystical incantations (tantrika). Do I need say more? My
utterances become inviolable commands (ajnasiddha), and I have subjugated the
goddess of learning Sarasvati (sarasvatasiddha). The personality of Acarya
Samantabhadra was a rare combination of the Three Jewels (ratnatraya) of Jainism
pristine faith, knowledge, and conduct - that are empirically considered
essential to the attainment of liberation. He was one of the most impelling
proponents of the Jaina doctrine of anekantavada - a philosophical system which
maintains that reality has multifarious aspects and that a complete apprehension
of it must necessarily take into account all these aspects. Non-appreciation of
this doctrine has caused the other philosophical systems fall into the trap of
one-sided, incomplete, and unsustainable dogmas that fail to explain the Truth.
The words of Acarya Samantabhadra are incontrovertible as these are guarded by
the Jaina doctrine of conditional predications (syadvada) - a system of
scientific safeguards that aims at maintaining proper consistency in
metaphysical thought. -

 Preface Several Jaina holy texts6 have mentioned that Acarya Samantabhadra was
destined to attain the highest and supreme status of a Tirthankara (a ford-maker
for the others to cross the ocean of worldly cycle of births and deaths -
samsara). As a Tirthankara he will propagate Truth for the welfare of all living
beings and will be worshipped by the lords of the devas and the men during the
five most auspicious events (panca kalyanaka)* that must take place in the life
of a Tirtharkara. HIS TIME The time when Acarya Samantabhadra flourished cannot
be ascertained with great precision. Jugalkishore Mukhtar, after due research
and detailed analysis as presented in his Preface to Ratnakarandaka-
sravakacara7, has arrived at the conclusion that Acarya Samantabhadra must have
lived after Acarya Kundakunda and Acarya Umasvami but before Acarya Pujyapada.
Broadly, he has fixed Acarya Samantabhadra's time as the second or the third
century, Vikram Samvata (VS). As Gregorian Year 2000 CE corresponds to Year 2057
in the VS calendar, Acarya Samantabhadra's time can be fixed around the second
century CE. HIS WORKS Acarya Samantabhadra is known to have authored the
following profound treatises: rimamsa or Devagamastotra Ratnakarandaka-
sravakacara Svayambhustotra Yuktyanusasana Stutividya or Jinasataka or
Jinastutisataka or Jinasatakalankara Jivasiddhi Gandhahastimahabhasya * see

======================
 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara Uncertainty prevails about the existence of the last
two treatises. Aptamimamsa, known also as Devagama or Devagamastotra, is a
treatise of 114 verses which discusses in a philosophical-cum-logical manner the
Jaina view of Reality, starting with the concept of omniscience and the
attributes of the Omniscient. Devotion to a deity without proper assessment and
understanding of its praiseworthiness leads to naught in terms of utility. Blind
faith based on traditional values and without the use of own power of
discrimination leads to superstitions. Superstitions arise from ignorance and
keep the worshipper overwhelmed with expectations and fear, just the opposite of
the very purpose of adoration. Adoration is laudable only if it renders
tranquility and equanimity to the mind of the worshipper. In the opening verse
of Aptamimamsa, Acarya Samantabhadra questions the validity of the attributes
that are traditionally associated with a praiseworthy deity and goes on to
establish, in Verse 6, the logic of accepting the Omniscient as the most
trustworthy and praiseworthy Supreme Being: You only are such an Omniscient,
free from all defects, because your words are not in contradiction with either
the reason or the scripture. The proof of non-contradiction of your words lies
in the fact that your tenets (about liberation etc.) are unopposed to what has
been established through the known sources of knowledge. After having
established that it was certainly possible to attain omniscience, and employing
the doctrine of conditional predications (syadvada), Acarya Samantabhadra faults
certain prevailing conceptions that were based on absolutism: existence
(bhavaikanta) and non-existence (abhavaikanta), non-dualism (advaita-ekanta) and
separateness (prthaktva-ekanta), and permanence (nityatva-ekanta) and
momentariness (ksanika-ekanta). He asserts that the entity (dharmi) and its
attribute (dharma) are neither absolutely dependent (apeksika) nor absolutely
independent (anapeksika). Only an entity which has general (samanya - concerning
the substance, dravya) and (xii)

 Preface particular (vicesa - concerning the mode, paryaya) attributes can be
the subject of knowledge. Substance without its modification and modification
without its substance cannot be the subject of valid knowledge; only their
combination can be the subject of knowledge. He goes on to clarify certain other
burning issues and misconceptions. He asserts that both fate and human-effort
are jointly responsible for desirable and undesirable effects. The desirable and
undesirable effects that one begets without premeditation should be understood
due primarily to one's fate (daiva). The desirable and undesirable effects that
one begets in consequence of premeditation should be understood due primarily to
one's human-effort (paurusa). Further, he asserts that our auspicious (vieudhi)
or inauspicious (saiklesa) kinds of dispositions cause the influx of meritorious
(punya) or demeritorious (papa) karmas. We are told that bondage (bandha) is
caused due to ignorance (ajnana) accompanied by delusion (moha), and bondage is
not caused due to ignorance (ajnana) not accompanied by delusion (moha).
Highlighting the indispensability of syaduada, it is asserted that syadvada, the
doctrine of conditional predications, and kevalajnana, omniscience, are both
illuminators of the substances of reality. The difference between the two is
that while kevalajnana illumines directly, syadvada illumines indirectly.
Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara, comprising 150 verses, is a celebrated and perhaps
the earliest Digambara work dealing with the excellent path of dharma that every
householder (sravaka) must follow. All his efforts should be directed towards
the acquisition and safekeeping of the Three Jewels (ratnatraya), comprising
right faith (samyagdarsana), right knowledge (samyagjnana) and right conduct
(samyakcaritra), which lead to releasing him from worldly sufferings and
establishing him in the state of supreme happiness. The treatise expounds an
easy-to-understand meaning of 'right faith': To have belief, as per the Reality,
in the sect-founder or deity (apta or deva), the scripture (agama or sastra),
and the preceptor (tapobhrt or guru). It specifies criteria to distinguish
between the real and the counterfeit (xiii)

======================
 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara enabling one to eliminate follies attributable to
wrong faith. Only the householder who has right faith is established on the path
to liberation. On the way, he obtains many ineffable boons; he is not reborn as
an infernal being, as a plant or an animal, in neuter and feminine genders, in
low caste, as a cripple, with a short lifetime, and in a state of poverty. He is
reborn as a heavenly being (deva) endowed with extraordinary splendour and a
lifespan of millions of millenniums, or as a human being endowed with vigour,
lustre, learning, strength, glory and renown, growth and advancement, success,
grandeur, high caste, and the ability to put in best of effort. In short, right
faith is the treasure chest of whatever is propitious and worthy; wrong faith of
whatever is inauspicious and contemptible. After laying the foundation called
the right faith, Acarya Samantabhadra goes on to complete the superstructure
known as the Three Jewels (ratnatraya) with the remaining two elements, right
knowledge and right conduct. The householder who has attained right faith on the
destruction of darkness of delusion is fit to attain right knowledge and right
conduct. He gets rid of the conduits of demerit (papa) comprising injury
(hinsa), falsehood (anyta), stealing (steya), unchastity (abrahma), and
attachment to possessions (parigraha). Further, he observes three subsidiary
vows (gunavrata), and four instructional vows (siksavrata). Giving up of the
body in a manner that upholds righteousness (dharma) on the occurrence of a
calamity, famine, senescence, or disease, from which there is no escape, is
called the vow of sallekhana. Sallekhana has been termed as the final fruit or
culmination of penance (religious austerity) and, therefore, all persons with
right faith, the ascetic as well as the householder, look forward to attaining
voluntary, passionless death at the appropriate time. The treatise finally
describes the eleven stages (pratima) of the householder's conduct.
Svayambhustotra is a fine composition, in Sanskrit, dedicated to the adoration
of the Twenty-four Tirthankara, the Most Worshipful Supreme Beings. Through its
143 verses Svayambhustotra not only (xiv)

======================
 Preface enriches reader's devotion, knowledge, and conduct but also frees his
mind from blind faith and superstition. Svayambhustotra takes the reader's mind
to a higher plane. It proclaims that the adoration of the Tirthankara is neither
for receiving boons nor for getting rid of unpropitious happenings. By making
zealous obeisance, and by recapitulating and recounting the supreme qualities,
including infinite knowledge and divine splendour, of the Tirthankara, the
worshipper only wishes to clear up his soul of the karmic mire, developing
thereby the power to someday tread the path shown by Him. Established firmly in
the right faith and rid of ignorance, he experiences ineffable tranquility and
equanimity. Yuktyanusasana, comprising 64 verses, evaluates in a logical manner
the beliefs that lead to the attainment of the state of Supreme Bliss as against
those that lead to the continuous wandering in the three worlds. Stutividya
(Jinasataka), as the name suggests, is the adoration of the Supreme Beings
(Tirthankara). Acarya Samantabhadra has skillfully used highly ornamental
language in this work; for instance, the first half of the line of a verse
becomes its second half by using the same letters in reverse order*.
Notwithstanding the floridity of language, each of the 116 verses of the
treatise carries profound meaning; when assimilated properly it leads to the
destruction of inimical karmas. THE STORY OF HIS DISEASE There is a story that
finds mention in several Jaina texts about the * Verse 10 reads as under:
bhAsate vibhutA'stonA nA stotA bhuvi te sabhAH  /  21: ftal: la TGI I TRA
ildegal: fraill In both lines, the latter half is the reverse arrangement of
letters used in the first half. (xv)

======================
 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara hardship that Acarya Samantabhadra had to endure
while he was an ascetic. Although there are variations in some elements of the
story, the essential gist is as follows: Svami Samantabhadra, in his early stage
of asceticism, was attacked with a disease known as bhasmaka which refers, in
Ayurveda, to the condition of insatiable hunger or appetite. The stomach has
digestive power or "fire" (jatharagni) that drives all digestion and when it
becomes very strong, food digests very quickly and produces hunger and desire
for more food. As food gets digested very quickly, the throat remains dry and a
burning sensation prevails. According to Ayurveda, air (vata), bile (pitta) and
phlegm (kapha) are essential elements in human body and a distortion in their
balance gives rise to health problems. When kapha becomes weak and vata and
pitta become strong, any food eaten gets reduced to ashes (bhasma) in no time.
The complications include jaundice, anemia, yellow skin, diarrhoea, urine
anomalies, colic, unconsciousness, hemorrhage, hyperacidity and burning pain.
The body progressively gets emaciated and weak. The only way to cure the disease
is to eat rich and stodgy food in profuse quantity. It is impossible for a Jaina
(Digambara) saint to eat more than once a day or in excess of his customary
intake which is less than the fill. Not deviating in the least from such
restrictions, Svami Samantabhadra tried to endure the affliction through strong
resolve. Finding the disease intractable, he ultimately thought of embracing
passionless death by resorting to the vow of sallekhana, as allowed in Jainism.
Svami Samantabhadra approached his Preceptor to get his approval for the
proposed vow of sallekhana. The Preceptor, an accomplished visionary, foresaw
that Svami Samantabhadra had many more years still left in his life, and that he
was destined to be a great exponent of Jainism. He, therefore, forbade Svami
Samantabhadra from undertaking the vow of sallekhana and asked him to free
himself from the symbols and restrictions of Jaina sainthood till the time his
disease got cured. (xvi)

======================
 Preface Svami Samantabhadra made obeisance to his Preceptor and, with a heavy
heart, took leave of him. Discarding nakedness and smearing his body with ash,
he adopted the exterior of a Hindu saint. He started taking food that would cure
him of his disease. He reached the town of Kanci, ruled by Sivakoti, a staunch
follower of Lord Siva. Sivakoti had built a Siva temple in Kanci where large
amount of food was being offered daily to the deity (Sivalinga). Saint
Samantabhadra told the king that he had the power to make the deity consume food
being offered. The king accepted the offer. Closing the doors of the temple,
Saint Samantabhadra ate the heap of food offering. When the doors were opened,
everyone was highly impressed with the so-called divine feat of the saint. This
continued for a few days. As the disease of Saint Samantabhadra got mitigated
with the passage of time, he was no longer able to eat all food being offered to
Lord Siva. The king became suspicious of the purported divine power of the saint
and ordered his actions to be watched, keeping the doors of the temple open.
Saint Samantabhadra grasped the gravity of the situation and took it as an
external calamity (upasagra) befalling him. Vowing not to take any food until
the end of the calamity and discarding all attachment to his body, he started
the adoration of the Twenty-four Tirthankara. As Saint Samantabhadra reached the
adoration of the eighth Tirthankara, Lord Candraprabha, and as he gazed at the
idol of the reigning deity (Sivalinga), due to some divine intervention, it
burst, revealing a beautiful and magnificent image of Lord Candraprabha, to the
wonder and astonishment of all present. Saint Samantabhadra finished the
adoration of the remaining sixteen Tirthankara. This miracle led King Sivakoti
and his younger brother Sivayana fall at his After completing the adoration of
the Twenty-four Tirthankara, Saint Samantabhadra gave his blessings to the two
brothers. This story portrays the environment in which the composition of t]
sacred text Svayambhustotra took place. As Saint Samantabhadra got cured of his
disease, he reinitiated (xvii)

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara himself into the order of holy Jaina asceticism.
King Sivakoti and his brother Sivayana, highly impressed with the Jaina doctrine
and the power of true adoration, left their worldly pursuits and became Acarya
Samantabhadra's disciples. I make obeisance humble at the worshipful feet of
Acarya Samantabhadra who had unmatched intellect to discern the right from the
wrong and illumined, through profound compositions, the right path that leads to
Supreme Bliss. Acarya Vidyananda - Established Firmly in Own Nature Fifty-three
years ago, in 1963, Acarya Vidyananda (b. 1925) took to the arduous path of
Digambara asceticism (muni). "I do not belong to others nor do others belong to
me; there is nothing that is mine here." Thus determined and conquering his
senses he took to the excellent form in which he was born (renouncing all
clothes, naked). A featherwhisk (picchi) - the implement of compassion, a water-
pot (kamandalu) - the implement of purity, and the Scripture (sastra) - the
implement of knowledge, became his only material companions. His pious figure,
turned golden by the fire of austerities (tapas) and rid of all encumbrances,
external and internal, personifies and propagates the teachings of Lord Jina.
Attachment and aversion are the soul's own psychical modes brought about by
nescience, which, in turn, is due to the soul's association with the karmic
matter. Psychical modes are the sole province of the soul and are not present in
any physical matter. Karmic bondage causes dispositions like attachment, and
such dispositions cause karmic bondage. Knowing the true nature of the soul and
the karmic matter, Acarya Vidyananda is engaged constantly in the practice of
ridding his soul from the bondage of karmic shackles. He reckons that the soul
is pure consciousness and all other dispositions (xviii)

 Preface are alien to it; only the various forms of karmas have kept it confined
to and whirling in the mire of the world. As all karmas associated with the soul
are annihilated, there is no cause for it to wander further in worldly
existence. Due to our wrong beliefs, we give undue and misplaced importance to
our so-called possessions, animate and inanimate, of the present life. These
possessions include our body, relations like husband or wife, sons, daughters,
friends and peers, and things that we acquire with great effort, like land,
business and wealth. Due to ignorance and consequent delusion, we engender in
our souls emotions of attachment and aversion. Attachment causes us to seek
association of desirable objects, and aversion dissociation of undesirable ones.
When desirable objects such as the son, the wife or the wealth are lost, we are
grieved. Contact of undesirable objects such as foul or hostile environment
causes us pain. On deprivation of desirable objects, we think repeatedly of
regaining them and on association of undesirable objects of getting rid of them.
When there is pain caused by disease such as gout and rheumatism, we think
continually about the means to subdue it, and be cured. Engrossing oneself in
pleasures not attained is another kind of sorrowful thought activity. We also
spoil our tranquility by causing injury to others, speaking lies, stealing, and
thoughts of safeguarding of wealth and other possessions. All the above-
mentioned thought-activities are evil or inauspicious, cause sorrow, and extend
transmigration. Turning his soul inwards and avoiding all outward concerns,
Acarya Vidyananda has established himself firmly in own nature. Engaged
incessantly in Self-realization, he has no time or inclination to interact with
the external environment. External objects generally remain unnoticed by him, as
he pays no attention to these. His interaction with the people is minimal and
without passions. For the few people he has to interact with occasionally, he
engenders no lasting emotions of attachment or aversion. A Yogi of few words, he

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara presents himself again to the service of the pure
Self. I repeatedly salute Acarya Vidyananda, the light to guide me on the path
that leads to true happiness, here and hereafter, by prostrating in front of him
with great devotion. I meditate on his virtues in order to wash away from my
soul impurities like attachment, aversion and delusion, and to reach the stage
of spiritual excellence. May 2016 Dehradun, India Vijay K. Jain References: 1.

three worlds (universe) and the beyond (non-universe). The word
'Srivardhamana'in the verse is also interpreted as the noble souls of the
twenty-four Tirthankara who have attained the supreme status marked by the
treasure of four infinitudes (ananta catustaya). Thereafter, through their
divine discourses, have caused the removal of karmic dirt from other souls.

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara EXPLANATORY NOTE Lord Vardhamana, the World Teacher
Lord Vardhamana (known also as Lord Vira or Lord Mahavira) is the last of the
twenty-four Tirthankara. A Tirthankara (a fordmaker for the others to cross the
ocean of worldly cycle of births and deaths - samsara) propagates Truth for the
welfare of all living beings. In every half cycle of cosmic age, the aeon of
regeneration (utsarpini) or of degeneration (avasarpini), twenty-four
Tirthankara are born in this part of the universe (called the Bharata ksetra of
Jambudvipa). Lord Vardhamana graced this earth more than two and a half
millenniums ago. He had the grandeur of right knowledge as his eyes and had cast
the divine light of his discourses to destroy the darkness of ignorance, just as
the rays of the moon destroy the darkness of the night. The self-enlightened
(svayambhu) saviour of all living beings, destroys the four inimical varieties
of karmas (ghatiya karmas) - deluding (mohaniya), knowledge-obscuring
(jnanavarniya), perception-obscuring (darsanavarniya), and obstructive
(antaraya) through pure concentration and attains the allembracing, supreme and
standalone knowledge known as omniscience (kevalajnana). As the soul attains
omniscience, the other four kinds of knowledge - sensory knowledge (matijnana),
scriptural knowledge (srutajnana), clairvoyance (avadhijnana), and telepathy
(manahparyayajnana) - which know the object of knowledge partially and in
succession become redundant and their role vanishes. Lord Vardhamana, thus
became the 'World Teacher' or 'Arhat' or 'Apta' or 'Jina' - the true guide to
put us on the right path and worthy to be venerated and worshipped by the lords
of the world. - A Tirthankara is worshipped by the lords of the devas and the
men during the five most auspicious events (panca kalyanaka) that 4

 Verse 1 must take place in His life: 1. garbha kalyanaka: when the soul of the
Tirthankara enters the Mother's womb. 2. janma kalyanaka: on the birth of the
Tirthankara. 3. dikna kalyanaka (or tapa-kalyanaka): when the Tirtharkara
renounces all worldly possessions and becomes an ascetic. 4. jnana kalyanaka:
when the Tirthankara attains omniscience (kevalajnana). 5. moksa-kalyanaka (or
nirvana-kalyanaka): when the Tirthankara finally attains liberation (moksa or
nirvana) and becomes a Siddha. The auspicious body (paramaudarika sarira) of the
World Teacher or Lord Jina acquires most splendid attributes, free from eighteen
imperfections. He is possessed of forty-six distinctive and divine attributes.
Peace and plenty must prevail wherever He goes. Naturally hostile animals become
friends in His presence, and flowers and fruits bloom out of season. The divine
attributes and splendours of the Arhat are described thus in the Scripture: The
Arhat is free from these eighteen imperfections: 1. janma-(re)birth; 2. zara
-old-age; 3. trsa - thirst; 4. ksudha - hunger; 5. vismaya - astonishment; 6.
arati - displeasure; 7. kheda - regret; 8. roga-sickness; 9. visada or soka -
grief; 10. mada - pride; ........................

sleep; 14. cinta - anxiety; 15. sveda - perspiration; 16. raga-attachment; 17.
dvesa - aversion; and 18. marana - death. Forty-six divine attributes of the
Arhat comprise four infinitudes (ananta catustaya), thirty-four miraculous
happenings (atisaya), and eight splendours (pratiharya). The four infinitudes
(ananta catustaya) are: 1. ananta jnana - infinite knowledge; 2. ananta darsana
- infinite perception; 3. ananta sukha-infinite bliss; and 4. ananta virya -
infinite energy. Of the thirty-four miraculous happenings (atisaya), ten appear
naturally at the time of birth, ten on attainment of infinite knowledge
(kevalajnana), and the remaining fourteen are fashioned by the celestial devas.
The eight splendours (pratiharya) are: 1. asoka vaksa - the Ashoka tree; 2.

 Verse 1 8. dundubhi - dulcet sound of kettle-drums and other musical
instruments. For the Lord's divine discourse the devas erect a heavenly Pavilion
(samavasarana) befitting His glory, and there the World Teacher sits, facing the
East, a few inches above the huge golden lotus placed on a throne of heavenly
gems. The Lord appears to be looking in all the four directions. His voice is
without the movements of the glottis or lips, and is, therefore, termed anaksari
(without letters). The Lord's divine voice, as a result of one of the eight
splendours (pratiharya), is heard and enjoyed by all present in their respective
tongue (ardhamagadhi bhasa). The World Teacher is the sun that blossoms the
soul-lotus of the worldly beings. His divine discourse is the rain of nectar-
water that washes away the dirt of ignorance from all souls. He is the wish-
fulfilling tree (kalpaviksa) for all those aspiring for liberation. When the
life-determining (ayuh) karma of the World Teacher is within one muhurta (48
minutes), He embraces the highest order of pure concentration and annihilates
the four non-destructive (aghatiya) karmas - feeling producing (vedaniya), life-
determining (ayuh), name-determining (nama), and status-determining (gotra) -
achieving the ultimate goal that a soul may aspire to reach, i.e., liberation
(nirvana)*. Liberation signifies that there is nothing left to strive for or
look forward to. His soul is purged of all karmic impurities and becomes
pristine like pure gold, free from dirt and alloys. He crosses the worldly ocean
of transmigration. His soul darts up to the summit of the universe to remain
there for eternity as a Siddha'with eight supreme qualities: 1. ksayika-
samyaktva - infinite faith or belief in the tattvas or essential principles of
Reality. It is manifested on the * "Acarya Subhacandra's Jnanarnavah", p. 438.

in having knowledge of infinite substances. It is manifested on the destruction
of the obstructive (antaraya) karma. 5. suksmatva - literally, fineness; it

destruction of the name-determining (nama) karma. 7. agurulaghutva - literally,
neither heavy nor light. Due to this quality of agurulaghutva, the jiva

 Verse 1 eternal and without form (non-material, colourless, arupi), and without
activity (niskriya). It is one self-subsisting, indivisible whole; it is without
parts and, as such, one single continuum. By negation of form or colour, the
accompanying attributes of taste, smell and touch also are denied. Its function
is to find room for all things. Space has infinite space-points and it pervades
both the universe (loka) and the non-universe (aloka). Now what is universe? The
space wherein the substances such as the medium of motion (dharma) and the
medium of rest (adharma) exist is called the universe-space (lokakasa). The
three worlds and the Siddha sila are part of the universe*: The Lower World: It
comprises seven earths (having abodes of infernal beings), one below the other.
The Middle (Transverse) World: It comprises innumerable concentric islands-
continents, extending one beyond the other in transverse position up to the
ocean of Svayambhuramana. Humans reside in the two and a half continents
commencing from Jambudvipa up to the Manusottara mountain chain which runs in
the middle of Puskaradvipa, and in the two oceans Lavanoda and Kaloda. The Upper
World: Mount Meru of Jambudvipa is embedded in the earth to a depth of 1000
yojana and is 99,000 yojana high. Below it is the Lower World. That which
extends transversely within this range (namely the height of Mount Meru) is the
Middle World. Above it is the Upper World. There are sixteen heavens or kalpa,
on eight storeys, which are the habitations of devas from Saudharma *See Jain,
S.A. (1960), "Reality - English Translation of Shri Pujyapada's
Sarvarthasiddhi", p. 84-106. + yojana is a unit of length measurement (see page

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara to Acyuta. Above these are the higher celestial
regions - vimanas of Graiveyaka, Anudisa, and Anuttara. Above these is the holy
Siddha sila, which is the abode of the Pure Souls dissociated forever from
corporeal body and, having reached the topmost part of the universe, remain
there in eternal bliss. The following description of the Siddha sila is given in
the Scripture*: At the top of the three worlds, is the eighth earth called
Isatpragbhara, which is one rajju wide, seven rajju long, and eight yojana high.
In the middle of this earth is the Siddha ksetra (Siddha sila) in the form of a
canopy (chatra), white like silver and with diameter equal to that of the human
region*. It is eight yojana thick in the middle and decreases towards the
margins like that of a bowl kept upright. In the upper layer of rarefied air
(tanuvatavalaya) of this Siddha ksetra reside the liberated Pure Souls, Siddhas,
endowed with eight supreme qualities. The whole of the region below this abode
of the Pure Souls is the region of transmigration, known as samsara, which is to
be crossed with the aid of the Supreme Teacher. Beyond the universe-space
(lokakasa) is the infinite nonuniverse space (alokakasa) - see Fig. 1 on the
next page. * Shri Nemicandra Siddhantacakravarti's Trilokasara, verses 556, 557,

EXPLANATORY NOTE The universe is eternal without beginning and end. In this
universe the living beings have been enduring misery, in the beginningless cycle
of births and deaths. Life is as uncertain as the bubbles that float on water.
And riches which beget worldly happiness are evanescent like the clouds and the
lightning. The body too is transitory by nature, full of suffering and pain,
worthless and unclean. The objects of pleasure of the senses too are transient
like the bubbles. Money has failed to procure happiness whenever it has been put
to test. There are many millions of people of money who are unhappy. Can it be
status, family, children, fame and the like which are known to have afforded
pleasure in the past? Surely not, for what they provide us with is ephemeral and
adulterated with suffering as their parting is certain. It can be shown with
respect to every worldly object that it cannot be happiness itself. There is no
way of escape for the person caught in the meshes of birth, old age, death,
disease and sorrow. The wealth acquired with great effort

 Verse 2 does not accompany the self to the next birth. The friends who have
shared the joys and sorrows of an individual cannot save him at his death. No
one, relations or others, can take away an individual's manifold sufferings such
as disease, old age and death. Happiness cannot be found in any object that we
zealously seek. The highest aspiration of man can only be to attain Divinity for
his soul which gives rise to unalloyed bliss and happiness, and freedom from
pain and suffering. The man with such an aspiration does not identify himself
with thoughts of worldly existence and endeavours to march on the path indicated
by the Omniscient Lord. Supreme happiness Acarya Nemicandra's Trilokasara
depicts the extreme happiness appertaining to the lords of the men and the devas
but holds it as insignificant as compared to the supreme happiness enjoyed by
the Siddha paramesthi: cakkikuruphaNisureMdesahamiMde jaM suhaM tikAlabhavaM  /
tatto aNaMtaguNidaM siddhANaM khaNasuhaM hodi  //  560  //  The happiness
appertaining to the king of kings (cakravarti), the resident of the regions of
enjoyment (bhogabhumi), the lord of the lower celestials, the lord of the
heavenly kalpa, and the lord of the heavens beyond the kalpa, is successively
infinitely more. The supreme happiness or bliss that appertains to the Siddha
paramesthi, however, can only be described as: "Just one instant of bliss that

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara The above statement, though made metaphorically, is
sufficient to suggest that the supreme happiness of the Siddha paramesthi is
indescribable; it is beyond the senses, selfdependent, and devoid of
fluctuations or impediments whatsoever. The happiness of the worldly jivas, on
the other hand, is sense-perceived, dependent on outside objects, and
characterized by unease or anxiety. As the tongue of the man suffering from acid
reflux is not able to savour the most delectable food, similarly, the soul which
is soiled with karmic dirt is not able to feel or depict the supreme, unbounded
happiness that appertains to the liberated soul. Jain, Vijay K. (2014), "Acarya
Pujyapada's Istopadesa - The Golden Discourse", p. 19. Acarya Samantabhadra
asserts that he is now going to preach that karma-destroying holy Doctrine which
illumines the path leading to liberation. He declares that several kinds of
worldly prosperity and distinctions wait on the way to embrace the worthy
explorer. ........................ 14

have not attained omniscience, only an Omniscient is able to explain the meaning
of liberation and the path leading to it. On the strength of the Doctrine
expounded by Lord Jina, learned preceptors (acaryas) have explained through
profound compositions that, empirically, right faith, right knowledge and right
conduct, together, must be understood to constitute the path to liberation.

reader with a simpler and more functional definition of right faith. He asserts
that right faith entails belief in three essentials: 1) the sect-founder (apta),
2) the scripture (agama), and 3) the preceptor (guru). But as there are many
sect-founders, scriptures and preceptors advocating doctrines that have mutual
contradictions and, moreover, each claiming to be genuine, how should one

 Verse 4 answer is provided in verses 5 to 10. Elaborating on the attributes of
right faith, in verses 11 to 18 the Acarya declares that it must be strengthened
by eight limbs (astanga): 1) freedom from doubt (nihsankita), 2) freedom from
worldly desire (nikkanksita), 3) freedom from revulsion (nirvicikitsa), 4)
freedom from superstitions (amudhadysti), 5) charitable forbearance and
concealment of defects in others (upaguhana), 6) ensuring steadfastness of right
faith and conduct so as not to swerve from the path to liberation
(sthitikarana), 7) propagation of the true path (prabhavana), 8) joy and
affection towards the right path and its followers (vatsalya). In verses 22 to
24 the three kinds of follies (muohata) that a householder with right faith must
assiduously guard against are mentioned: 1) folly relating to worldly customs
(lokamudhata), 2) folly relating to deities (devamudhata), 3) folly relating to
preachers (gurumudhata). The Acarya also asserts that a person with right faith
must be free from eight kinds of pride (mada) - verse 25: 1) pride of knowledge
(jnana mada), 2) pride of veneration (puja mada), 3) pride of lineage (kula
mada), 4) pride of caste (jati mada), 5) pride of strength (bala mada), 6) pride
of accomplishments (rddhi mada), 7) pride of austerities (tapa mada), 8) pride
of beauty (sarira mada). ........................ 19

following explanation to this verse: The acharya gives here the six principal
characteristics of the Jaina Scripture. The word of the Tirthankara is never in
conflict with valid knowledge, however acquired; it is never couched in mystic
or mythological language, but reveals the nature of things as these exist in
nature. For this reason the Jaina Siddhanta has nothing in common with dogmatic
theology or mysticism, and is a purely scientific system of rational thought,
capable of raising the human soul from the lowest depths of sin and despair and
of installing it in the coveted Supreme Seat. The next great characteristic
given by the acharya is the quality of being helpful to all living beings,
without exception. Daya (mercy) and ahimsa (non-injuring) being the fundamental
tenets of the Holy Siddhanta, Jainism ........................ 24

======================
 Verse 9 can never be ranked with those other creeds whose teaching inculcates,
directly or indirectly, the taking of life for sacrifice or food. Thus, at every
stage of its activity, Jainism always tends to protect and advance the interests
of all kinds of living beings. The last great characteristic of the Holy
Scripture is that it is by itself capable of destroying falsehood. This is only
natural, for it is a peculiarity of the scientific method which, being
commendable to the most exacting and critical intellect, cannot but destroy all
forms of error, doubt and ignorance, the three constituents of falsehood. It
will be seen that Jainism proceeds by describing the nature of existing
substances, dealing fully, in so far as is necessary for the purposes of
religion, with the lities or attributes which arise from their interaction in
the course of evolution. It has nothing in common with dogmatism - "thou shalt
do this," and "thou shalt not do that," etc., - nor with mystic mythology which
says one thing and means quite another. Jain, Champat Rai (1917), "Ratnakarnda-
sravakachara (or The Householder's Dharma)", p. 4-6. Acarya Kundakunda in
Pravacanasara states that the scriptures are the true sources of direct and
indirect knowledge: jiNasatthAdo aDhe paccakkhAdIhiM bujjhado NiyamA  /  carefa
Halaget et frei Hufergoo II -ce II He who assimilates the reality of substances
through the Jaina scriptures, which contain valid knowledge (pramana), direct
and other, certainly exhausts the heap of delusion and, therefore, the
scriptures should be studied regularly. ........................ 25

kSayi tApakaM ca sneho vRthAtreti hitaM tvamAkhyaH  //  (7-2-32) As an inanimate
equipment (a vehicle, for example) requires an animate being (a man) for its
operation, so does the body, that the soul adopts as its encasement, require the
soul for its functioning. The body is repugnant, foul-smelling, perishable, and
a source of anxiety and, therefore, it is futile to have attachment towards it.
O Lord Suparsvanatha, this is your benign precept. 30 Jain, Vijay K. (2015),
"Acarya Samantabhadra's Svayambhustotra", p. 45. Acarya Pujyapada puts this
aspect of the Jaina Doctrine plainly and forcefully in Istopadesa:

 Verse 13 corollary, undermine the well-being of the body. Fasting and
meditation are helpful aids to purify the soul but ignore the immediate needs of
the body. Renunciation and austerities help the soul by saving it from harmful
desires but deprive the body of the objects of its guard and embellishment. An
ascetic striving after emancipation endures, without regret or remorse, bodily
hardships and afflictions. He unreservedly endures the torments of extreme
hunger, parching thirst, biting cold, and oppressive heat of the sun.
Afflictions caused by insect-bites, roaming bare-foot on thorny roads, sitting
in a particular posture for a long time, lying down on uneven and hard ground,
and even serious disease, do not swerve him from the path. He embraces blameless
nakedness like that of the child and is always free from the excitement of
passions and agitations of the senses. Engaged continually in cleansing the soul
from the mire of karmic impurities, he has no desire left to take bath and
cleanse his body. - Having learnt the truth about bondage and emancipation, the
saint is indifferent to the pleasures of the senses. He has no thought or desire
for the well-being of the body and does not adorn it. For him the body is just
an aid for acquiring the Three Jewels (ratnatraya) of merit - right faith, right
knowledge and right conduct and safeguarding them. He accepts pure, properly
prepared food only once in a day, that too less than his fill, in order to keep
his body intact, just as lubrication is indispensable to the running of the
wheel. Although his physical frame reduces to a mere assemblage of skin, bones,
and arteries, it becomes auspicious, adorable and worshipful. Due to severe
austerities, he may have even developed extraordinary powers of cure but being
devoid of passions, attachment and aversion, he does not use these powers to
cure himself. No wonder, with the passage of time, the purity of his soul
increases 31

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara manifold as his karmic body is purged of many kinds
of harmful karmic matter. Our gross body must undergo changes due to the
substance of time (kala). Gradual, imperceptible changes take place in it
incessantly, every instant. If gradual, imperceptible changes do not take place
there can be no perceptible change either. We do not develop wrinkles or grey
hair all of a sudden. When we perceive major transformations or changes in our
body, which truly are results of minute changes taking place every instant, we
term these changes as due to 'aging'. The substance of time, which itself is
without activity, is the auxiliary cause of the minute changes taking place in
all substances. Conventionally, however, we talk of time as the past, the
present and the future, or years, days and hours. Changes, minute as well as
perceptible, must take place in our body and this process cannot be subverted.
The body must undergo transformations due to the substance of time. And on the
completion of the age-karn the soul must depart from the body to its new abode.
Our efforts to nourish the body at the expense of the soul, therefore, are
short-sighted and are bound to result into suffering. Jain, Vijay K. (2014),
"Acarya Pujyapada's Istopadesa - The Golden Discourse", p. 58-60. Jain, Champat
Rai's explanation of this verse is apt and forthright: Non-Jainas generally
express disgust at the sight of Jaina ascetics whose rules of conduct do not
allow them to attend to the embellishment of their physical person. This verse
points out the proper mental attitude for a true believer - he should respect
the virtues of the saint, and love him for his self-control, but should not feel
disgust with the impure or unclean state of his outward self, i.e., body.

 Verse 13 faeces, saliva and many other similar impurities, how can the body,
asks the acharya, be regarded as clean? Let him who would laugh at the dirty
condition of the body of the Jaina saint remember that, in its true nature, his
own body is but a basket of stinking unsightly filth covered over with leathern
parchment. There is yet an important distinction between his body and that of
the saint which consists in the fact that, while his own carcass is filled, to
the full, with the refuse resulting from unrestrained sense-indulgence, the
saint's contains less filth, both quantitatively and qualitatively, owing to the
control which he puts on his senses. The difference between their bodies is then
reduced to this that the saint's is actually the purer of the two, though the
other appears to be more attractive outwardly. And, so far as the purity of the
soul is concerned, the man who scorns the saint is nowhere as compared with him
whom he likes to scorn, since the very fact of ridiculing a true saint is an
indication of gross ignorance and sin. The dirty, untidy appearance of a muni
(ascetic) is a necessary step in the path of progress, and is unavoidable at a
certain stage. As a matter of fact, the attainment of nirvana is consistent only
with a complete absorption in one's own atman (soul), and necessitates the
withdrawal of attention from the physical body and the outside world, so that
the Jaina householder, who is expected to be a pattern of cleanliness, is
enjoined to gradually train himself to neglect his fleshy 'prison', the body of
matter, and to study the well-being of his soul. The ascetic, who has renounced
the world and who wishes to reach the goal in the shortest space of time,
naturally lays all the stress he can on spiritual meditation, and can ill afford
to waste his time on studying such useless and progress-obstructing matters as
the attractiveness of his person. Neither is he a loser in the long run, for the
destruction of his ghatia karmas at once raises him ........................ 33

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara to the status of divinity, when those very beings
who used to ridicule him fall down at his feet. It will be now evident that
those who affect disgust at the sight of a Jaina monk are never likely to attain
nirvana, for neglect of the body is an absolutely unavoidable necessity for the
pilgrim's progress, and he who has nothing but loathing and disgust for the kind
of life which those who are striving to reach the goal lead can never be induced
to set his foot on the Path. For the same reason those who object to the nude
appearance of the Jaina saint also debar themselves from nirvana. Jain, Champat
Rai (1917), "Ratnakarnda-sravakachara (or The Householder's Dharma)", p. 7-9.

(devas) with extraordinary splendour and enjoy millions of millenniums in the
company of other devas and devis (celestial nymphs). Due to their eight divine
accomplishments such as the ability to contract their body to a miniscule size,
and physical grandeur, they remain extremely contented. * EXPLANATORY NOTE The
eight divine accomplishments are: 1) anima - the ability to contract one's body
to a miniscule size; 2) mahima - the ability to expand one's body to an
extremely large size; 3) laghima - the ability to make one's body lighter than
air; 4) prapti - the ability to touch far away objects while remaining seated at
one place; * This is also interpreted as: Due to their eight divine
accomplishments such as the ability to contract their body to a miniscule size,
they remain extremely contented. 58

 Verse 37 5) prakamya - the ability to walk on the surface of water or swim on
the surface of earth; 6) isitva - the ability to rule the three worlds; 7)
vasitva - the ability to control anyone; 8) kamarupitva - the ability to make
many bodily forms simultaneously. In some commentaries, garima - the ability to
make one's body extremely heavy - is mentioned, in place of kamarupitva. Acarya
Pujyapada asserts in Sarvarthasiddhi: Persons with right faith, till they
finally attain liberation, are destined to superior states of existence thereby
getting reborn in auspicious environments only. It is said in the Scripture that
persons with right faith will be reborn among the fourth order of devas -
heavenly (vaimanika) devas - and not among the three lower orders, namely the
residential (bhavanavasi), the peripatetic (vyantara), and the stellar
(jyotiska) devas. Those persons who are characterized by right belief and
practice restraint with attachment, and restraint-cum-non-restraint, will also
be reborn in the higher heavens of Saudharma kalpa and so on and not among the
three lower orders of celestial beings. Adapted from: Jain, S.A. (1960),

Belief in substances, souls and non-souls, as these actually are, is right
faith. The Omniscient Lord has called right knowledge (samyagjnana) as the
effect and right faith (samyagdarsana) as the cause. Therefore, it is
appropriate to venerate and acquire right 65

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara knowledge after the acquisition of right faith.
Having acquired right faith, detailed cognition of substances, without fallacies
of doubt (samsaya), perversity (vimoha or viparyaya), and indefiniteness
(vibhrama or anadhyavasaya), is right knowledge. Doubt (samsaya) means swaying
of the mind without being able to assert the true nature of a thing. After
acquiring the belief that bondage of virtuous karmas leads to birth in the
heavens, entertaining skepticism about its validity is an instance of doubt. The
cognition of an object as something which is contrary to its true nature is
perversity (vimoha). For example, if we perceive nacre to be silver, we have
knowledge vitiated by perversity. Indefiniteness (vibhrama) is vacillation about
the real nature of a thing due to the shrouding of the intellect. For example,
when we touch something while moving, we may be conscious that we have touched
something but are unable to say, with any certainty, what it was, our knowledge
is enshrouded in indefiniteness. The attribute 'right' is intended to ward off
uncertainty, doubt and error in knowledge. Right knowledge provides the
foundation that is necessary for the conduct to be 'right'. Right faith needs to
be reinforced by right knowledge derived from study, meditation and listening to
the discourses of true saints. Acarya Amitagati, in Yogasara Prabhita, has
emphasized the importance of proper discrimination between the right and the
wrong while acquiring knowledge: jJAnasya jJAnamajJAnamajJAnasya prayacchati  /
ArAdhanA kRtA yasmAd vidyamAnaM pradIyate  //  6-34  //  Adoration of (right)
knowledge results in the gain of (right) knowledge and adoration of wrong

(kevalajnana) - which knows the whole range of objects of knowledge
simultaneously, without gradation (akramabhavi), and second, indirect (paroksa),
which knows the objects of knowledge partially and in succession (kramabhavi).
Knowledge in succession features the doctrine of conditional predications -
syadvada, and ascertainment, without contradiction, of one particular state or

reality and hence a non-substance (avastu). Jain, Vijay K. (2016), "Acarya

karananuyoga, which knows and reflects, like a mirror, the three worlds
(universe) and the beyond (non-universe), the worldly time-cycle, and the four
stages of soul-existence. EXPLANATORY NOTE The karananuyoga reflects, as these
are, the nature of the universe (loka) and the non-universe (aloka), the worldly
time-cycle in the regions of Bharata and Airavata, and the four states of
soulexistence infernal beings (naraka), human beings (manusya), plants and
animals (tiryanca), and celestial beings (deva). The nature of the universe
(loka) and the non-universe (aloka) has already been briefly discussed (pages 8
to 11 ante). Jaina cosmology divides the worldly cycle of time (kalpakala) in
two parts or half-cycles (kala) - ascending (utsarpini) and descending
(avasarpini) each consisting of 10 x 1 crore x 1 crore addhasagaropama (10
kotikoti sagaropama). Thus, one cycle of time (kalpakala) gets over in 20
kotikoti sagaropama. During the ascending period (utsarpini) of the half-cycle
(kala), in the regions of Bharata and Airavata, there is the all-round increase
in age, strength, stature and happiness of the living beings, while during the
descending period (avasarpini) of the half-cycle, there is the all-round
deterioration. Just as the moon continues its never-ending journey of waxing and
waning - 71

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara luminance, there is incessant and eternal revolution
of the worldly cycle of time in these regions. Each half-cycle is further
divided into six periods of time. The periods in the descending (avasarpini)
half-cycle are termed as: 1) susama-susama, of 4 kotikoti sagaropama duration;
2) susama, of 3 kotikoti sagaropama duration; 3) susama-dusama, of 2 kotikoti
sagaropama duration; 4) dusama-susama, of 1 kotikoti sagaropama minus 42000
years duration; 5) dusama, of 21000 years duration; and 6) dusama-dusama, of
21000 years duration. The ascending (utsarpini) half-cycle has the same periods
of time but in reverse order. In this half-cycle there is the all-round,
progressive increase in age, strength, stature and happiness of the living
beings. We are presently living in the fifth period (dusama) of the descending
(avasarpini) half-cycle. This period started after 3 years and 872 months of the
liberation (nirvana) of the 24th Tirthankara Lord Mahavira. The complete cycle
(kalpakala) of 20 kotikoti sagaropama duration is represented in Fig.-2 on the
next page. A transmigrating soul can be in any of the four states of existence,
technically called caturgati. These four states of existence are the infernal
state, the subhuman state of animals and plants, the human state, and the
celestial state. All transmigrating souls remain embodied according to their
individual spiritual status. It has been said in the Scripture: The soul indeed
has taken in (enjoyed) successively all the molecules of matter in the entire
universe and has cast them off. And the soul has been revolving many times over
in the cycles of matter. 72

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara There is no point in the entire space of the
universe which has not been the seat of birth of the soul. In this way, the soul
has wandered in the entire universe space many times over. The transmigrating
soul has been born and dead many times, in the ascending as well as in the
descending aeons. Owing to its association with wrong belief, the soul has
wandered, with different lifetimes, in all the states of existence, from the
infernal regions up to the upper Graiveyaka heavens. Owing to its association
with wrong belief, the soul is plunged in all the stages of the four types of
bondage - nature, duration, intensity, and space - and wanders in the cycle of
thoughtactivity. Adapted from: Jain, S.A. (1960), "Reality", p. 57-60. It is
owing to the influence of the associated karmic matter that the soul wanders
about in the samsara. Its natural rhythm of freedom is consequently lost and it
undergoes all kinds of changes of form and state in the course of
transmigration. Although characterized by pure knowledge and perception, it
wanders about, over and over, without a break, in places inhabitable and
uninhabitable. The karananuyoga includes description of various kinds of karmas,
their bondage and fruition, and stages of spiritual development (gunasthana).
Some Scriptures that are part of the karananuyoga are: Trilokasara;
Tiloyapannatti; Gommatasara - Jivakanda; Gommatasara - Karmakanda; and
Karmapraksti. ........................ 74

through the seven tattva or the nine padartha. The soul (jiva) is characterized
by consciousness. The non-soul (ajiva) is nonconscious. The inflow of karmic
matter into the soul is influx (asrava). Virtuous activity is the cause of merit
(punya) and wicked activity is the cause of demerit (papa). The mutual
intermingling of the soul and the karmic matter is bondage (bandha). The
obstruction to the inflow (asrava) of karmic matter into the soul is stoppage
(samvara). The separation or falling off of karmic matter from the soul is
dissociation (nirjara). The complete annihilation of all karmic matter bound
with the soul is liberation (moksa). Some Scriptures that are part of the

======================
 Verse 53 The severance of the vitalities that are present (all the ten
vitalities are not present in all living beings) is called injury. It is wicked
as it causes pain and suffering to living beings. The qualifying phrase 'arising
from passionate activity' is intended to indicate that mere severance of the
vitalities is not wicked. "Even with the severance of life one is not stained
with the sin of injury." Again it has been said thus in the scriptures: "When a
monk goes on foot with carefulness, sometimes small insects get crushed under
his feet and die. Still there is not the slightest bondage of sin in his case.
From the spiritual standpoint, infatuation is called attachment." Now, has it
not been admitted that mere passionate attitude even without the severance of
vitalities constitutes violence? "He who acts with negligence commits injury
whether death is caused to organisms or not. And he who proceeds with proper
care does not contract bondage of karma by mere injury." Yes, it is true. But
there is no inconsistency in this. Even in the case of the person with
negligence there is severance of life-principles at least in thought. It has
been said thus in the scriptures. "He who has passions causes injury to himself
by himself. Whether injury is then caused to other living beings or not, it is
immaterial." Jain, S.A. (1960), "Reality", p. 196-197. ........................

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara existent; 2) a statement that affirms the existence
of an object that is not existent; 3) a statement that pronounces the existence
of an object as another object; and 4) that speech which is condemnable
(garhita), sinful (savadya), and unpleasant (apriya). Condemnable (garhita)
speech comprises statements which may be spiteful and contemptuous, harsh,
nonsensical, useless gossip, and also those contrary to the Scripture. Sinful
(savadya) speech comprises statements which may be prompting others to engage in
piercing, splitting, beating, ploughing, trading, or stealing, as such
activities lead to the destruction of life. Unpleasant (apriya) speech comprises
statements which may cause in others discomfiture, fear, regret, enmity, grief,
hostility, or anguish. Jain, Vijay K. (2012), "Shri Amritachandra Suri's
Purusarthasiddhyupaya", p. 61-65. Jain, Champat Rai provides the following
explanation: The ascetic's vow of truthfulness, it may be stated here, is of
unbending rigidity; but as the present work is only concerned with the layman's
duties in life, it does not describe the nature of the more austere vows. The
use of the word 'gross' in connection with this vrata enables the householder to
avoid its breach by relating stories, writing works of fiction, diplomacy and
the like. The reason why truth with a tendency to cause affliction, is to be
avoided needs no explanation. There are many occasions when speaking out truth
causes unmerited suffering to others, and clearly silence would be golden in all
such cases. Jain, Champat Rai (1917), "Ratnakarnda-sravakachara (or The

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara Characterization of attachment to possessions
(parigraha) as infatuation is all-inclusive. Therefore, a person who has
renounced all possessions, but under infatuation, certainly is 'with
possession'. yadyevaM bhavati tadA parigraho na khalu ko'pi bhirnggH| bhavati

 Verse 70 even sinning in thought in respect of those places which one cannot
reach. Hence, it is said that the observance of this vrata enables the layman's
vows to approach the five mahavratas of asceticism, in point of merit, beyond
the limits fixed for his movements. In other words, the digurata places a layman
on an equality with an ascetic in respect of the regions of space lying beyond

EXPLANATORY NOTE Karmas bound with the soul have the tendency to interfere with
its natural functioning. Due to the influence of the karmas, the soul gets into
a state of weakness and then acts in a manner inimical to its natural
tendencies. The affinity between the soul and the karmic matter may be explained
by the fact that the former is the knower and enjoyer of the latter. The soul is
the enjoyer, and the matter, the object of enjoyment; hence the relation between
them is that of the subject and the object. The interaction between the soul and
the matter can take place only when the former is actuated by a desire for the
enjoyment of sense objects, and, conversely, matter can affect the soul only
when the soul is rendered vulnerable by its passions. The man under the
influence of karmas cannot resist temptations and falls prey to four types of
passions - anger, pride, ........................ 118

======================
 Verse 71 deceitfulness, and greed. As a consequence of the rise of passions in
the soul, physical matter gets bonded with it, transforming itself into karmic
matter, which then becomes known as the karmas of various kinds. The four types
of passions, mentioned above, are subdivided into four classes each according to
their potency: 1. anantanubandhi - most malignant: that which leads to endless
cycle of worldly existence owing to wrong faith. 2. apratyakhyana - highly
malignant: that which arrests even partial abstinence of the householder. 3.
pratyakhyana - malignant: that which enables the householder's vows to be
observed but stands in the way of the more rigorous vows of the ascetic. 4.
samjualana - gleaming: that which disturbs perfect conduct. It gleams along with
self-restraint or even in its presence self-restraint shines. It only debars the
soul from pure self-concentration. The potency of the four classes of passions
has been likened to a line drawn on stone, on earth, on dust, and on water,
respectively. Jain, Vijay K. (2014), "Acarya Pujyapada's Istopadesa - The Golden
Discourse", p. 87-88. Jain, Champat Rai elucidates: Anger, pride, deceit and
greed are the four principal kinds of passions (kasayas). They are dealt with
under four different heads in the Jaina Siddhanta, according to the degree of
their intensity. The intensest, called the anantanubandhi, is the worst kind and
prevents the acquisition of Right Faith itself; the intenser type, known as the
apratyakhyana, obstructs Right Conduct altogether and hinders even the
observance of the minor vows of the householder; the intense, designated the 119

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara pratyakhyana, enables the householder's vows to be
observed, but debars one from the mahavratas of asceticism and the higher forms
of meditation; and the mild one sanjvalana only stands in the way of pure Self-
contemplation (sukla dhyana). The destruction or subsidence of the first type
leads to the acquisition of Right Faith; of the second, to the adoption of the
householder's vows; of the third, to the observance of mahavratas; and of the
fourth, to sukla dhyana, which is the cause of omniscience and nirvana. This
verse refers to the subsidence of the pratyakhyana type which reduces the
intensity of passions to the samjualana degree. These, as the acharya points
out, are of such a mild type that often it is difficult to say whether they
exist or not Jain, Champat Rai (1917), "Ratnakarnda-sravakachara (or The

very slow, if not impossible. How are the deluding karmas destroyed? The
potential soul becomes a right believer and with growing purity of thought
activity, starts its journey of spiritual progress. 121

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara From the empirical point of view, souls are divided
into fourteen classes or spiritual stages (gunasthana). Acarya Pujyapada's
Sarvarthasiddhi delineates the fourteen spiritual stages (gunasthana) as under:
1. mithyadrsti - deluded 2. sasadanasamyagdssti - downfall 3. samyagmithyadrsti
- mixed right and wrong belief 4. asamyatasamyagdesti - vowless right belief 5.
samyatasamyata - partial vows 6. pramattasamyata - imperfect vows 7.
apramattasamyata - perfect vows 8. apurvakarana - new thought-activity 9.
anivittibadara-samparaya - advanced thought-activity 10. suksmasamparaya -
slightest delusion 11. upasanta-kasaya - subsided delusion 12. ksina-kasaya -
destroyed delusion 13. sayogakevali - Omniscient with vibration 14. ayogakevali
- non-vibratory Omniscient It is clear that real spiritual progress starts only
after the acquisition of right faith. The sixth stage (gunasthana), called
pramattasamyata, is the first step in the life of a Jain monk (muni) as he
embraces the great vows (mahavrata). In this stage, the great vows are tinged
with gleaming passions (samjualana kasaya) which though do not hinder self-
restraint but prevent the acquisition of perfect conduct (yathakhyata caritra).

sin (papopadesa), giving of things that cause injury (himsadana), evil thoughts

(pramadacarya), as purposeless sinful activity -anarthadanda. EXPLANATORY NOTE
Acarya Pujyapada's Sarvarthasiddhi: That, which leads to sin without any
advantage, is purposeless sin. Desisting from such activity is to be free from
purposeless sin. Purposeless sin is of five kinds, namely evil thought,
preaching of sin, negligent activity, giving of hurtful things, and listening to
undesirable stories. Wishing how others may suffer from victory, defeat,
punishment, bondage, mutilation, confiscation of all possessions and so on, is
evil thought. Preaching sin is using words which incite others to cause
sufferings to animals, to pursue commerce and activities causing injury to
living beings and so on. Intoxicated activity is cutting trees, digging the
earth, sprinkling water and so on, without any purpose. Giving hurtful things
such as poison, thorns, weapons, fire, rope, whip, stick and so on is the fourth
kind. The fifth kind is listening to or teaching of stories which provoke
injury, lust, etc. 126 Jain, S.A. (1960), "Reality", p. 203.

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara infinite jivas, therefore, all such vegetables must
not be consumed. Jain, Vijay K. (2012), "Shri Amritachandra Suri's
Purusarthasiddhyupaya", p. 105. Jain, Champat Rai gives the following
explanation: The green roots and vegetables mentioned are forbidden on the
ground that each of them is the abode of more souls than one; and butter is
objectionable on account of its becoming the incubator of a certain kind of
germs on a large scale within a very short time of its preparation. Jainism
allows butter to be used by its followers only within an hour or so of its
churning, though ghee (clarified butter) may be eaten at any time before it
becomes unwholesome. The reason for this is to be found in the fact that butter
becomes sterilized in the process of clarification and therefore unsuitable as a
breeding ground for germs. Jain, Champat Rai (1917), "Ratnakarnda-sravakachara

Vow should be taken not to consume victuals which although not forbidden but are
unsuitable for consumption (particular to each individual), and those which are
not worth the consumption; only intentional abstention from an object of sense-
indulgence is called a vow (vrata). EXPLANATORY NOTE Eatables which although may
not have been forbidden but are unsuitable for any reason, like being
deleterious to health, need to be given up by a votary. Things, like cow-urine
and milk of shecamel, which are considered unsuitable for consumption in refined
cultures should also be left out from the individual's list of consumables,
under a vow. Such a resolve to renounce even those things which one does not
consume normally will augment the householder's small vow of ahimsa, the
foundation of all vows. ........................ 139

withdrawal (or indifference) for the venom of sensual pleasures, thinking over

with on hand sensual pleasures, intense craving for sensual pleasures, and
enjoying sensual pleasures obsessively, are the five transgressions of the vow
of limiting consumable and nonconsumable possessions
(bhogopabhogaparimanavrata). 142 Thus ends the fourth part called Right Conduct
- Subsidiary Vows (gunavrata) of the Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara, composed by

Suri's Purusarthasiddhyupaya", p. 89-90. 1 Desavrata limits the field of
activity still further than in the case of digurata. Besides, digurata is taken
for one's lifetime whereas desavrata is taken for shorter periods. 144

way of doing by oneself, causing to be done, and approval when done by others,
through the three kinds of activity - of body, speech, and thought) from
commission of the five demerits (papa), at all places (within as well as outside
the limits set under the vow of abstaining from activity with regard to region -
desavakasikavrata) for a fixed time period, is called the vow of periodic
concentration (samayika, also samayika), a limb of instructional vows-
siksavrata. EXPLANATORY NOTE Acarya Pujyapada's Sarvarthasiddhi: The preposition
'sam'means one state of being. For instance, ghee becomes one with the thing
mixed. Similarly oil also. To become one is samaya. That, which has oneness as
its object, is samayikam. One attains the great vows when one practises samayika
(concentration) at a particular place and time, since one is free from minute
and gross injury and so on. It is argued that it would be perfect restraint and
discipline (samyama). But it is untenable, as there is the presence of karmas or
passions which arrest complete restraint. In that case these should not be
called great vows. No. These are called great vows figuratively... Jain, S.A.

is not improper, and is beneficial. Jain, Vijay K. (2012), "Shri Amritachandra
Suri's Purusarthasiddhyupaya", p. 94-95. Jain, Champat Rai elaborates on the
meaning of the verse: The samayika vrata is intended to be observed three times
a day if possible; otherwise at least once daily. Its object is to enable the
layman to abstain from all kinds of sins during the period of time fixed for its
observance. The usual duration of the samayika vow is an antara muhurta (a
period of time not exceeding 48 minutes). During this period, which the layman
spends in adoration and meditation, he vows to refrain from the commission of
the five kinds of sin - hinsa, falsehood, theft, unchastity and love of material
possessions - with his mind, speech and body, in any of the three ways (krta,
karita, and anumodana), both within and without the limits determined by him in
connection with the desavakasika vow. ........................ 151

======================
 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara In performing samayika the devotee stands facing
north or east and bows to the panca paramesthi. He then sits down and recites
the namokara mantra a certain number of times, and finally devotes himself to
holy meditation. This consists in: i) pratikramana, recounting the sins
committed and repenting for them, ii) pratyakhyana, resolving to avoid
particular sins in future, iii) samayika karma, renunciation of personal
attachments, and the cultivation of a feeling of regarding every body and thing
alike, iv) stuti, praising the four and twenty Tirthankaras, v) vandana,
devotion to a particular Tirthankara, and vi) kayotsarga, withdrawal of
attention from the body (physical personality) and becoming absorbed in the
contemplation of the spiritual Self. As regards place, the samayika may be
performed anywhere - a temple, private residence, forest and the like - but the
place should not be a thoroughfare, nor one that is open to disturbance. A place
with evil repute or unholy associations is also to be avoided. The posture for
samayika may be either - i) padma asana, the sitting posture, with interlocked
legs (the right one placed on the left thigh and the left on the right), the
hands placed in the lap with the palms facing upwards (the right one being on
the top), and with attention fixed on the foremost point of the nose; ii) kharga
asana, the standing posture, with feet at a distance of about two inches from
each other, the hands resting naturally by the sides, but not so as to touch the
body; and attention fixed on the point of the nose as in the padma asana; or 152

 Verse 97 iii) ardha-padma asana, the semi-padma posture, which differs from the
padma in respect of the position of the left leg, which is placed under the
right thigh. The samayika may be performed in a reclining or even a lying down
posture if one is unable, from illness or some other cause of a like nature, to
sit up. The above postures are recommended, because they are the most conducive
to bodily steadiness and firmness. They may appear hard to adopt at first, but
they will be found to be surprisingly easy after a little practice. Jain,

have pronounced that the time for which the knot of hair on the top of the head
is tied, the fist is closed, the knot on the piece of cloth is tied, or for
which the padmasana, the kayotsargasana, or the normal posture can be
maintained, is the appropriate duration for observing the vow of periodic
concentration (samayika). EXPLANATORY NOTE The verse can also be interpreted as
referring to proper method for observing the vow of periodic concentration
(samayika). The householder, as he gets ready for the samayika, should tie the
knot of his hair on the top of the head, fingers clenched in the palm, and
clothes properly set, so as not to cause any disturbance. The posture should be
such that one can remain comfortable for the period of the samayika; the
padmasana, the kayotsargasana, or the normal posture with legs crossed are most
suitable. Jain, Champat Rai gives the following explanation: The idea of tying a
knot in one's choti (a tuft of hair on the top of the head worn by Hindus and
Jainas) and the like, is not that the knot in itself is of any value or
importance in the process, but that it implies a mental determination to
continue ........................ 154

 Verse 98 meditation so long as it remains untied. The knot is merely intended
to serve the purpose of the uplifted hand of a constable, and is a signal for
the stoppage of all kinds of mental 'traffic' which might interfere with
steadiness and continuity of holy meditation. Jain, Champat Rai (1917),

senses such as sounds and dwelling in the self in deep concentration is fasting.
It means giving up the four kinds of food. Prosadhe upavasa is prosadhopavasa,
that is fasting on the eighth and fourteenth days of the lunar cycle. The
fasting householder discards bodily adornments such as bath, perfume, garlands,
and ornaments, prosadha: the eighth and the fourteenth days of a fortnight, the
bright half and the dark half of the lunar month. - The five senses turn away
from their pleasure of touch etc. and repose in the self in deep concentration
during fasting. 164

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara welcome, a high seat, washing the feet, worshipping,
bowing, purity of mind, speech and body, and purity of food. Jain, Vijay K.
(2012), "Shri Amritachandra Suri's Purusarthasiddhyupaya", p. 109-110. The first
ahara of Lord Mahavira after His renunciation (dikna); After spending 30 years
as youth (kumarakala), Lord Mahavira, reflecting on His past incarnations,
decided to tread the path that leads to the end of the cycle of births and
deaths. He contemplated on the twelve conceptions (baraha bhavana) -
transitoriness (anitya), helplessness (asarana), transmigration (samsara),
loneliness (aikatva), distinctness (anyatva), impurity (asuci), influx (asrava),
stoppage (samvara), dissociation (nirjara), the universe (loka), rarity of
enlightenment (bodhidurlabha), and Truth proclaimed by religion (dharma). The
Lord renounced all worldly pursuits and decided to adopt the supremely worthy
Jaina asceticism in order to tread the path to liberation. Laukantika devas from
Brahmaloka came down to ship Him. The Lord had, by birth, the first three kinds
of knowledge, sensory (mati), scriptural (sruta) and clairvoyance (avadhi) and
now He had acquired the fourth kind of knowledge - telepathy (manahparyaya). The
Lord took to the observance of great vows (mahavrata) along with other
attributes of asceticism and decided not to break His fast before the end of
three days. Although the Lord had been enjoying inner happiness all the time,
after three days of Holy Meditation, the former Prince set out, barefoot, with
no vestige of cloth on His body and unmindful of the pangs of hunger, towards
the town of Kulagrama, ruled by king Kula, to seek some kind of nourishment
(ahara) for His body so that it could withstand further rigours of austerity.
King Kula's happiness had no bounds when he suddenly saw such a divine,

 Verse 113 rushed to welcome the Lord. He made obeisance to the Lord by
circumambulating thrice and then bowed to Him by touching the ground with five
parts of his body. He offered to the World Teacher an eminent, high seat. He
washed with extreme devotion the Lotus Feet of the Lord and applied the water
that had become sacred after coming in contact with the Lotus Feet of the Lord
to his forehead and other parts of body. He worshipped the Lord with great
devotion and with pure and pious eight substances. With utmost humility and
purity of heart he bowed and pleaded the Lord to accept his offering. His
affectionate devotion to the Lord had made his heart pure. By articulating the
glory of the Lord, he made his speech pure. By performing the aforesaid bodily
activities, he attained the purity of his body. He pronounced with sincerity the
purity of food. This way, with nine kinds of devotion (navadha bhakti), King
Kula gave the supreme gift of pure food to the greatest of all saints. The devas
witnessed the event with extreme delight and in approval of the noble act of
offering food to the Most Worthy Recipient, rained down choice gems, flowers,
and fragrant water in the royal compound. They made cheering sound of "Victory!
Victory!" and beat the heavenly drums. Jain, Vijay K. (2015), "Acarya

stop." As the muni stops, he is welcomed by the gesture of circumambulating him

Feet of Lord Jina. EXPLANATORY NOTE Jain, Champat Rai gives the gist of the
story: The reference is to the jiva of a frog who obtained deva-birth in the
heaven-worlds by devotion to the last Tirthankara, Bhagwan Mahavira. This
particular soul happened to be a miser in its previous incarnation when its evil
karmas caused it to be re-born as a frog in the town of Rajagriha (Patna
District). When the Holy Tirtharkara visited that place, the frog recovered the
memory of his past life owing to the fruition of good karmas, and coming to know
the joyous tidings of the arrival of the Holy Tirthankara, proceeded, full of
devotion and love, to offer obeisance to the Lord. He was, however, crushed on
the way under the foot of one of the elephants of the royal procession, which
was also proceeding towards the same goal. Having died under the most auspicious
circumstances, he was re-born in one of the heavens, and immediately descended
to the earth to worship the source of his great good luck. Jain, Champat Rai

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara passions emaciated by abandoning their sources
gradually at the approach of death. The householder observes sallekhana at the
end of his life. "Josita' means observing it with pleasure. Hence sevita, though
clear in meaning, is not used. If there be no willingness, sallekhana cannot be
forced on one. If there is liking for it one does it oneself. It is argued that
it is suicide, since there is voluntary severance of life etc. No, it is not
suicide, as there is no passion. Injury consists in the destruction of life
actuated by passion. Without attachment etc., there is no passion in this
undertaking. A person, who kills himself by means of poison, weapon etc., swayed
by attachment, aversion or infatuation, commits suicide. But he who practices
holy death is free from desire, anger and delusion. Hence it is not suicide. "It
has been taught by Lord Jina that the absence of attachment and the other
passions is non-injury and that the rise of feelings of attachment and the other
passions is injury." For instance, a merchant collects commodities for sale and
stores them. He does not welcome the destruction of his storehouse. The
destruction of the storehouse is against his wishes. And, when some danger
threatens the storehouse, he tries to safeguard it. But if he cannot avert the
danger, he tries to save the commodities at least from ruin. Similarly, a
householder is engaged in acquiring the commodity of vows and supplementary
vows. And he does not desire the ruin of the receptacle of these virtues, namely
the body. But when serious danger threatens the body, he tries to avert it in a
righteous manner without violating his vows. In case it is not possible to avert
danger to the body, he tries to safeguard his vows at least. How can such a
procedure be called suicide? Jain, S.A. (1960), "Reality", p. 205-206.

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara calculated to directly strengthen the soul and to
prevent its future re-birth in any but the very best surroundings. Those who
adopt the sallehhana vow immediately become self-reliant, self-composed and
self-centred; they cease to be agitated by personal considerations and
suffering, and rise above the cravings and longings of the world. The effect of
the terribly resolute attitude of mind implied in this vow on the departing soul
is simply wonderful, and immediately raises its rhythm, lifting it out of the
slough of despond and negativity. The man who wanders or tosses about hither and
thither, weeping and crying, in the closing moments of life, and spends the
little time at his disposal in making vain endeavours to avoid the unavoidable,
is nowhere compared with him who, realising the hopelessness of the endeavour to
save his life, earnestly applies himself to control his destiny. The result is
that, while the latter attains to deva-birth in the highest heavens, the former
only finds himself in painful and unenviable circumstances and surroundings.
Jain, Champat Rai (1917), "Ratnakarnda-sravakachara (or The Householder's
Dharma)", p. 58-59. Sallekhana is not a custom (pratha or societal practice) The
origination of a pratha or societal practice can be traced to expediency of time
and space as ascertained by people according to their beliefs, and
understanding. A pratha lacks universal appeal and acceptance and also sanction
from established, time-tested sources of knowledge like the agama. It is
practised only in reference to particular space and time. In India, one such
societal practice, called the sati-pratha, was observed for a period of time; a
widow would immolate herself on her husband's pyre, or would commit suicide in
some other fashion shortly after her husband's death. 196 .....

 Verse 122 Sallekhana, unlike a custom, is a pious vow, like non-injury and non-
stealing, which every individual, young and old, male and female, looks forward
to observing when the appropriate time comes. Even a young individual can say
with pride and determination that he or she looks forward to observing
sallekhana at the time of death. And the elderly wishes and prays that at the
time of death he or she should have the opportunity to observe the vow of
sallekhana. Could a married woman ever wish and pray to have the opportunity to
observe the practice of sati? Sallekhana is a reasoned, scientific way of facing
death, an inescapable truth of life, and is applicable to and implementable by
the whole of humanity. Acarya Pujyapada's Samadhisataka: naSTe vastre
yathA'tmAnaM na naSTaM manyate tathA  /  naSTe svadehe'pyAtmAnaM na naSTaM

destroyed when his clothes are destroyed, similarly the awakened man does not
consider himself to be dead when his body dies away. While the ignorant man is
terrorized at the approach of death which entails separation of his soul from
its perishable tenement, the knowledgeable man embraces death with equanimity
knowing well that his animate soul is entirely distinct from its inanimate
encasement. Devotees, men and women, of Lord Jina, in the prime of their lives,

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara O Lord ! May Your protective shadow be always on my
head and may I attain a pious and passionless death (samadhi marana) at Your
doorstep. Such an exalted place is accorded to sallekhana in Jaina religious
tradition! Sallekhana surely must be embraced, as a vow, at the time of death.
But death has its own strange ways of making appearance and, therefore, the idea
of attaining a pious and passionless death must fill the mind, through and
through, of a householder (sravaka) from an early stage of his spiritual
development if he wishes to unfailingly impart ineffable worth to his present
life. Sallekhana - the logical way to complete the journey of life All worldly
souls (samsari jivas) are embodied according to their individual spiritual
status, and are subject to the cycle of births and deaths. The body, associated
with each soul, is subject to growth, old age, decay and death. Death entails
that the soul must quit the existing body to acquire a fresh body consistent
with and determined by the record of the karmic conditions, of which the soul
itself is a repository. One of the most contentious issues in metaphysics is the
relationship between the soul and the body. The Jaina metaphysics holds that the
two are entirely different entities but live together for a certain period of
time and then depart. From the point of view of the modes in bondage, owing to
the influence of karmas, the soul is corporeal in the embodied state. From the
point of view of its pure nature, the soul is incorporeal. Though the soul is
one with the body in the embodied state, it is different from the body because
of its distinctive characteristics. The corporeal nature of the soul is
predicated in the nonabsolutistic or relativistic sense only. From one point of
view the soul is incorporeal, but from another point of view it is corporeal. A
person is deluded when he identifies an animate object, soul (jiva), 198

 Verse 122 as inanimate, and an inanimate object, non-soul (ajiva), as animate.
A deluded person breeds attachment to the body which is intimately bound to him,
and with persons or objects like friends, clothes, houses, riches and
geographical territories, which are not so bound to him. He desires their
possession, ownership and company, and their separation brings about grief to
him. He spends his whole life in acquiring and then protecting them, and their
inevitable separation causes unbearable misery to him. He lives under the fear
of death. All human beings who have not met with an untimely death pass through
eight experiential stages in life - birth, infancy, childhood, adolescence,
youth, adulthood, old age, and death. We are mostly dependent on others till we
reach the stage of youth. In these formative years, most decisions pertaining to
our upbringing are taken by others. As we reach adulthood, we become aware of
our inherent likes and dislikes, strengths and weaknesses, and start pondering
over matters like our objectives and goals in life. We take decisions on our
career, family, and social life. By the time we reach the stage of advanced
adulthood we have enough experience to look back to and vision to look forward
to. We are mature enough to understand the meaning of life, its pleasures and
pains. We are able to observe the ups and downs in the lives of people around
us. More importantly, we are able to reflect on whether there is something we
must do regarding the direction of our life, or live life just as it comes. In
our worldly life we seek pleasure and try to avoid pain and suffering. No sooner
do we make headway in acquiring and then using an object of pleasure than a
feeling of its inadequacy creeps into our mind. We want something superior in
terms of both, the quality and the quantum of pleasure. We become slaves of
pleasure. Typically, we over-indulge at night, get a terrible hangover the next
morning, but crave for the same thing again at the fall of the night.

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara We get overpowered by the senses and become addicted
to pleasures. As the harmful effects of this addiction on our mind and body
surface in due course of time, realization dawns that perhaps we have moved too
far ahead in the wrong direction. We get disheartened to see that pleasures are
short-lived and are followed, sooner or later, by pain and suffering.
Despondency sets in; we wish to do something about it but it is too late by
then. Stark reality that we must leave behind, voluntarily, all material
possessions strikes in our face. There is no escape from this plain truth; if we
do not volunteer to do it ourselves, death will perform the act for us,
ruthlessly. The idea of separation from our prized possessions leaves us in
great pain and misery. Enjoyment of a few pleasures in the past is no solace to
a grieving soul. Realization of this basic truth early in life can save us from
much hardship and agony later on. Wise men start looking at the realities of
life and ways to cope with these as soon as the realization dawns that they have
just one or two score years of the present life left. They clearly apprehend
that the worldly existence is full of misery; disease, old age, separation from
kith and kin, accident, natural disaster, failure, and death are but some of the
realities of life that one has to run into. They take corrective actions to make
the best use of the remaining years. While they commiserate with people living
in conditions of poverty, deprivation, impa not allow despondency to set within
themselves. They are not particularly attracted towards the pleasures that
worldly objects have to offer. They realize that pain and suffering are
inextricably linked to the worldly life and are attributed to our karmas. Our
virtuous karmas in the past have provided us with whatever good and enjoyable we
have in this life and we must now make efforts to engage ourselves only in
actions that will provide us with joyous feelings in the remaining years of this
life, and the next. ........................ 200

 Verse 122 When a man turns his consciousness exclusively to the Ideal of the
pure soul, he is saved from indulging in activities that result in perennial
entrapment in the world. Knowing the body as unconscious, mortal, and a product
of karmas, one who does not undertake activities pertaining to the body performs
the essentials of detachment from the body. The soul has the intrinsic attribute
of darting upward and the body, being physical matter, is an instrument of
pulling the soul downward. The body, being a direct outcome of karmas, is
absolutely worth dissociation and detachment for anyone who is treading the path
to liberation. Only with such discrimination between the soul and the body can
one develop interest and inclination towards the soul and disinterest and
disinclination towards anything that is antithetical to the soul. The way to
make human birth meaningful is through renunciation of worldly pleasures, and
taking recourse to meditation, austerities, propagation of true faith, and
finally attaining a pious and passionless death (samadhi marana) by
relinquishing the body through the method of sallekhana the gateway to the path
to liberation. 201

Acarya Nemicandra's Dravyasamgraha: One must meditate on this supreme mantra, of
thirty-five letters, that makes obeisance to the five Supreme Beings (panca

the adoration of this mantra only. By the power of this mantra, the soul soiled
with karmic mire gets sanitized and the wise gets rid of the worldly sufferings.
This mantra is a friend, like no other, in the hour of need, of all souls
desirous of achieving liberation. There are umpteen narrations in Jaina
Scriptures that even animals who had earlier committed dreadful sins, including
himsa of many living beings, have achieved heavenly abodes 207

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara vows partially but the ascetic to a very large
extent. We know that our activities of the body, mind, and speech, when actuated
by passion, result into bondage of karmas to our soul. Virtuous activity is the
cause of merit (punya) and wicked activity is the cause of demerit (papa).
Bondage of karmas that cause merit provides us with pleasant feeling, propitious
life-span, auspicious rebirth, and high status. Although our ultimate goal is to
attain liberation for our soul, but many a time we are not able to give up our
desires completely. Still we restrain ourselves from undesirable activities by
observing vows. In other words, we follow restraint with attachment. Such
restraint is among the causes of influx of karmas leading to the celestial
birth. Right belief is also the cause of influx of lifekarma leading to the
celestial birth. The ultimate destination of all bhavya souls (having potential
to attain liberation) is the supreme and everlasting state of knowledge, faith,
bliss and power. Who in his senses would opt for this short life as a human
being to be withered away in just acquiring, and then indulging in, the objects
of sense-pleasures? The man well-versed in the Scripture is aware that the goal
of liberation may be far away in time. Life as a human being, though short,
provides a great opportunity to mould the future course of the soul for an
exceedingly long period of time. As an instance, the minimum life-span in the
heaven of Saudharma kalpa is a little over one palyopama and the maximum
lifetime is little over two sagaropama. The term palyopama is defined in detail
in the Jaina scriptures; suffice it to say here that from the worldly standards
it is an exceedingly long period of time. And a sagaropama is 1015 times a
palyopama! Life-spans in the hells too are very long; the maximum duration of
life in the seven infernal regions is one, three, seven, ten, seventeen,
twentytwo, and thirty-three sagaropama, respectively. The only way to

The reader's attention is drawn to the distinction between the two stages
represented by the 'Arhat' and the 'Siddha'. The attainment of omniscience is
described in the first sutra of this chapter, and the attainment of complete
liberation in the second. Omniscience is attained on the destruction of the
deluding, the knowledge-obscuring, the perception-obscuring and the obstructive
karmas, in the order mentioned in the first sutra. As long as the deluding
karmas are very powerful, spiritual progress is very slow if not impossible. In
that condition the self is almost a slave to the karmic forces at work and is

in the ocean of transmigration. The secret of spiritual progress lies in the
ascendancy acquired with great difficulty and effort by the self over the
deluding karmas. Only then does the self become the master of evil and begin to
succeed in overcoming evil. It is no doubt a tough fight between the self and
evil, and there may be ups and downs in this long and arduous struggle. But the
undaunted and unconquerable soul carries on the battle incessantly, gradually
establishes ascendancy over the forces of evil, ultimately roots out evil with
the help of pure concentration and becomes the Victor. This epic story of the
struggles of the soul with the forces of evil may be read with absorbing
interest in the several masterpieces of Jaina literature in Sanskrit, Tamil,
Kannada and other Indian languages. These fourthe deluding, knowledge-obscuring,
perception-obscuring and obstructive karmas - are called destructive (ghati)
karmas, as these four main types of karmas interfere with the four infinitudes
described in the fourth sutra, which are the essential characteristics of the
soul. The other four main types are called non-destructive (aghati) karmas, as
these do not harm these four infinitudes. The self attaining omniscience becomes
an Arhat, and the self attaining complete release a Siddha. There may be a
longer or a shorter interval between the attainment of these two stages. That
depends upon the lifetime still remaining on the manifestation of omniscience.
And this may vary from soul to soul. Till the time of complete release, the
Arhat is associated with the body. When the other four types of karmas are
entirely destroyed, the released pure soul (Siddha) goes up to the summit of the
universe and dwells there in eternal bliss. Jain, S.A. (1960), "Reality", p.

sharp thing which causes pain to the body is a sting. Just as the sting causes
pain to sentient beings, the emotional excitement arising from karmas, which
causes bodily and mental pain, is figuratively called a sting. This is of three
kinds, the sting of deceit, the sting of desire for enjoyment or pleasure, and
the sting of perverse attitude (wrong faith). Maya is deceit. Nidanam is desire
for worldly pleasure and splendour. Mithya darsanam is wrong faith. He who is
free from these three kinds of stings is called a 223

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara votary (urati). Now it is contended thus. 'A person
is free from stings in the absence of stings, and one who observes vows is
called a votary. But a person free from stings is not fit to be called a votary.
For instance, a man who has a staff cannot be said to carry an umbrella.' The
reply is this. The votary is one who is characterized by both the attributes,
namely observing vows and being free from stings. So by merely practising vows,
one cannot be called a votary, unless one is free from stings. What is meant is
that, in the absence of stings, one who observes vows is a votary. For instance,
a person is said to be rich in cows when he has plenty of milk and ghee. He
cannot be said to be rich in cows in the absence of milk and ghee, even if he
has several cows. So also, even if a person observes vows, he cannot be called a
votary if he is not free from stings. Jain, S.A. (1960), "Reality", p. 200.

of external possessions and with a deep sense of renunciation remains engrossed
and contented in the true nature of his soul, is called the parigrahavirata
sravaka (ninth stage). EXPLANATORY NOTE As infatuation caused by attachment to
possessions (parigraha), internal and external, gets vanquished, and as the mind
becomes steady through constant practice, one becomes capable of meditating on
the pure soul. Ten kinds of external possessions and fourteen kinds of internal
possessions are said to be the causes of infatuation. The external possessions
are (1) land, (2) houses, (3) gold, (4) silver, (5) cattle, (6) grain, (7) maid-
servants, (8) male-servants, (9) clothes, and (10) utensils. The fourteen
internal possessions are (1) wrong belief, (2) malesex passion, (3) female-sex
passion, (4) neuter-sex passion, (5) joking, (6) zest, (7) boredom, (8) grief,
(9) fear, (10) disgust, (11) anger, (12) pride, (13) deceitfulness, and (14)
greed. These possessions cause the loss of equilibrium of the mind.

 Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara The man void of such possessions can concentrate his
mind on the pure soul and attain excellent meditation. Meditation which is
directed towards the pure Self is the means of self-realization. Ignorance that
stupefies the faculties of perception and will must be got rid of. There should
be neither attachment nor hatred towards the objects of the environment. There
should be unruffled peace in thought, speech and body. Meditation attended by
such circumstances manifests like the fire that destroys the rubbish heap of the
karmas. Jain, Vijay K. (2014), "Acarya Pujyapada's Istopadesa - The Golden
Discourse", p. 76. Acarya Samantabhadra's Svayambhustotra: ahiMsA bhUtAnAM

Holiness cannot be found in hermitages which advocate even the slightest of

Therefore, with extreme benevolence, to attain the purity of non-injury, you had
relinquished both the internal as well as the external attachments, including
the degrading clothes and other add-ons to the body. Jain, Vijay K. (2015),

householder who, leaving his home, goes to the spiritual preacher in the forest,
adopts vows, lives on food obtained through religious solicitation, observes

explanation which throws adequate light on the verse: The highest point of a
householder's conduct is reached in the eleventh pratima which takes him to the
door of asceticism. This pratima, called the uddista (that which has been
ordered or mentioned beforehand) tyaga (renouncing) is indicative of the mental
determination of the aspiringjiva to avoid accepting anything in the shape of
food by special invitation or appointment. It comprises two kinds of
householders: (1) ksullaka and (2) ellaka. The ksullaka wears a langoti* and a
sheet of cloth, three cubits long and of a single width, but the ellaka rejects
the wrapper and keeps only the langoti. They both keep a bowl, for carrying
water, and a whisk of the softest *langoti - a narrow strip of cloth worn by men
to hide their nudity. 236

 Verse 147 peacock feathers for removing insects from their person, books and
the like, without injuring them. As regards begging, for food, a ksullaka, if he
belong to any of the three higher castes should eat only what he gets from one
household, but he may visit five houses, one after another if he happen to be
asudra. In no case should he call at another house after getting sufficient food
for the day, but should sit down and eat his repast at the place where the
quantity of his daily rations is completed. While calling for food, he should
not penetrate beyond the court-yard, hall or vestibule, nor ask or beckon for
food, but should only wish the inmates dharma labha (may you obtain spiritual
merit) and recite the namokara mantra. If he be not observed or welcomed with
due respect, he should immediately depart from that place and proceed to
another. In no case should he call at that house a second time that day. The
ellaka also observes these rules, but he eats what is obtained from one kitchen
alone. Both the ksullaka and the ellaka eat only once a day, and go out in
search of food between the hours of ten and eleven in the morning. Jain, Champat
Rai (1917), "Ratnakarnda-sravakachara (or The Householder's Dharma)", p. 69-70.

and pursuit of happiness. The hardships and afflictions that we have to endure
are of our own making. Our deeds, driven by passions, lead to sufferings and
reproach in this world and the next. Virtuous activity alone, which is the cause
of merit (punya), leads to joyous feeling, auspicious life, charming and
lustrous physique, and high status. Our ultimate goal is the attainment of the
divine attributes, in fullness and perfection, of our souls. We can reach the
goal only through the threefold path of right faith, right knowledge and right

Size: 16 x 22.5 cm * ISBN 81-903639-3-X Rs. 350/ As Acharya Vidyanand writes in
the Foreword of Samayasara, it is the ultimate conscious reality. The
enlightened soul has infinite glory. It has the innate ability to demolish
karmas, both auspicious as well as inauspicious, which constitute the cycle of
births and deaths, and are obstacles in the path to liberation. Samayasara is an
essential reading for anyone who wishes to lead a purposeful and contented life.
It provides irrefutable and lasting solutions to all our problems, concerning
worldly ways as well as spiritual curiosities and misgivings.

Amritchandra Suri's Purusarthasiddhyupaya is a matchless Jaina text that deals
with the conduct required of the householder (sravaka). In no other text that
deals with the conduct required of the householder we see the same treatment of
complex issues such as the transcendental and the empirical points of view,
cause and effect relationships, and injury and non-injury, maintaining
throughout the spiritual slant. The basic tenet of Jainism - noninjury or Ahimsa
- has been explained in detail in the book. 246

Dravyasamgraha is one of the finest classical Jaina texts, composed by His
Holiness Acarya Nemichandra (c. 10th century CE). It deals primarily with the
Realities (tattvas) that contribute to world process. The conduct required for
attaining the ultimate goal of liberation follows from the knowledge of these
Realities. Both, the transcendental and the empirical points of view, have been
considered while explaining the nature of substances, souls and non-souls. It
will be of much use to scholars worldwide interested in pursuing the study of
Jaina epistemology. 247

AcArya pUjyapAda viracita iSTopadeza Foreword by: Acarya 108 Vidyanand Muni
VIJAY K. JAIN His Holiness Acarya Pujyapada, who graced this earth around 5th
century CE, had crafted some valuable gems of Jaina doctrine, including
Sarvathasiddhi and Istopadesa. Concise but deep in import, Istopadesa
unambiguously establishes the glory of the Self. It is an essential reading for
the ascetic. The householder too who ventures to study it stands to benefit much
as the work establishes the futility of worldly objects and pursuits, and
strengthens right faith, the basis for all that is good and virtuous. ISBN

81-903639-8-0 Rs. 500/ Aptamimamsa by Acarya Samantabhadra (2nd century CE)
starts with a discussion, in a philosophical-cum-logical manner, on the Jaina
concept of omniscience and the attributes of the Omniscient. The Acarya
questions the validity of the attributes that are traditionally associated with
a praiseworthy deity and goes on to establish the logic of accepting the
Omniscient as the most trustworthy and praiseworthy Supreme Being. Employing the
doctrine of conditional predications (syaduada) - the logical expression of
reality in light of the foundational principle of nonabsolutism (anekantavada) -
he faults certain conceptions based on absolutism. He finally elucidates correct
perspectives on issues including fate and human-effort, and bondage of
meritorious (punya) or demeritorious (papa) karmas. 250
