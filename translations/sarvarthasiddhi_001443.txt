The *Tattvartha Sutra* is an ancient text of Jain knowledge and is possibly the
first text to introduce Jain principles in a systematic and concise manner in
the form of sutras in Sanskrit. It is such a beautiful and authentic composition
on its subject that no other text has been able to compare with it till date.
The importance and glory of this text is also evident from the fact that it is
equally popular among all sects of Jainism - Digambara, Svetambara, Sthanakvasi,
etc. It is also an unparalleled text in Jain literature in terms of popularity.
Many commentaries have been written on the *Tattvartha Sutra* from time to time.
In the Digambara sect, its commentary *Sarvarthasiddhi* by Devanandi Pujyapada
is considered to be the most ancient. It has been published many times, but this
is its most authentic publication with a detailed Hindi commentary, based on a
critical study of ancient manuscripts and fixing the text. Jain scholar
Siddhantacharya Pt. Phoolchand Shastri has revealed the essence of
*Sarvarthasiddhi* in the Hindi commentary of this edition. He has also discussed
in detail the *Tattvartha Sutra* and its various aspects in the introduction. An
essential work for students of Jain philosophy and every seeker.

## Primary  The **Tattvartha Sutra** is one of the most ancient texts of Jainism
and is possibly the first text in Sanskrit to introduce Jain principles in a
concise and systematic way through aphorisms. This composition is so beautifully
crafted that no other text has been able to match it till date. The glory of
this text is further evident from the fact that it is equally popular among all
sects of the Jain community - Digambara, Svetambara, Sthanakvasi, etc. In terms
of popularity, it is an unparalleled text in Jain literature.  Many commentaries
have been written on this text over time. In the Digambara sect, the
**Sarvarthasiddhi** commentary by Devnandi Pujyapada is considered the most
ancient. It has been published many times before. However, a critical study of
ancient manuscripts to determine the text had not been attempted before. Pandit
Phulchandra Shastri deserves our gratitude for his efforts in this direction.
The text was not originally edited and printed for publication by the Jnanapith,
therefore the editors of this series had no role in its editing process.
Panditji's preface, etc., was also written and printed independently. The views
expressed in it regarding Malli Tirthankara, the authenticity of the Svetambara
Agamas, etc., are Panditji's own and readers should view and understand them
accordingly. From our perspective, it would have been better if these statements
were not included in this text: because, as we have said above, this composition
is popular throughout the Jain community, it is not limited to a particular
sect. Therefore, it is more appropriate to present this text on that elevated
platform. We hope and trust that readers will appreciate and utilize this
publication with the same generous spirit.  - Hiralal Jain - Editor, Upadhye

## Editorial (Third Edition)  1. **Sarvarthasiddhivriti**, written on the
**Tattvarthasutra**, is the first commentary available in the entire Jain
tradition. After a thorough study, it is certain that
**Tattvarthadhigamabhashya** is a later work, composed between
**Sarvarthasiddhi** and **Tattvarthavatika**. This is why criticism of many
accepted sutras is found in **Tattvarthabhashya**, while there is no indication
that **Tattvarthabhashya** was written before **Sarvarthasiddhivriti**. It is
true that the **Angas**, known as **Acharangadi**, were composed before
**Sarvarthasiddhi** was written in the Svetambara tradition. Otherwise,
criticism of topics like **Kevalakavalaahar** would not be found in
**Sarvarthasiddhi**.  This is the state of affairs. **Prajnakshu** **Swami Shri
Pan. Sukhlalji** was well aware of this situation. Yet, looking at the preface
of the third edition of **Tattvarthasutra** translated by him, it does not seem
that he has changed his old views even slightly. However, we have learned from
the teachings of Jain philosophy that **moksha** means liberation of the soul
from **samyoga** and **samyoga-vritti** and becoming alone. And this is possible
only when complete self-reliance is embraced both internally and externally.
This is also the reason for our faith in the Digambara tradition. Therefore,
while we accept this ultimate conclusion of Jain philosophy, we also accept the
historicity of the related literature in the order in which it was written and
published. We accept that the **Agam** literature of the Svetambara tradition
was compiled in the 5th century AD. Therefore, it is clear that other supporting
literature was written only after that. This is why the writers of the same sect
have determined the time of writing of **Tattvarthadhigamabhashya** to be the
first half of the 8th century.  After this general observation made from a
historical perspective, we are now presenting here the necessary amendments made
in the original and translation of the second edition of **Sarvarthasiddhi** in
order.  **Second Edition** **Jiva** always has **Jivatva** **Page-50 13-30**
**Present Edition** **Page-50** **Jiva** is always present compared to the
general **Jivan** **13-30** According to the purpose of the scriptures **14-18**
Both **Pramanas** and various **Nayas** in their form **15-1** **14-17**
**14-35** Many forms of **Pramanas** and **Nayas** in the scriptures are
considered only as **Jnana** **15-30** **Jnana** is considered only as **Jnana**

357-25 ## 2. Appendix-2 ## Page 390 Number 17.1 - Under this, 'Tirashchinaam
Kshayikam Nasti', the statement after this is not from Sarvarthasiddhi. This is
clear from the fact that whoever is a Krityakrityavedak Samyagdristi or a
Kshayik Samyagdristi, born in the four gatis, is born in the three gatis except
the first hell. He is not born in the Napumsakavedis after death, nor in the
Strivedis. If the original statement 'Tirashchinaam Kshayikam Nasti' was not
there, there would have been no objection. But since this statement is present
in all the handwritten manuscripts, we have kept it as it is in the original.
Due to the presence of this sentence, the question arises in humans, in
comparison to Bhavanatar, that there should have been a statement in the
original that a Krityakrityavedak Samyagdristi and a Kshayik Samyagdristi are
not born in the Manusyanis after death. But any Samyagdristi, after death, is
born in the Purushavedis without exception, except the first hell, not in any
other. This statement itself confirms the said statement. ## Page 395 Line 29,
there is a missing 'ninety-nine thousand' after 'ninety-nine lakh', and the
number of Sarvasanyatas given here is 299 in each Gunasthan of the four
Gunasthanas of the Upshama category, and according to the Dakshina Pratipatti,
598 in each Gunasthan of the Kshapaka and the Ayogikaveli. Therefore, the total
number of all the Sanayatas is 89999997. Therefore, the sum of the entire number
from the Pramattasanyata is 89999997. As follows: ## Pramattasanyata 59398206 +
1 Apramattasanyata 29699103 + four Upshamaka 1196 + four Kshapaka 2392 +
Sayogakevali 898502 + Ayogikaveli 598 = 89999997. ## It should be known here
that the statement "Yadichait Ekasmim Samaye Sambhavanti" on page 395, line 19,
is not meant to be the number of Sanayatas at any one time, but this number is
said with a special intention. Because, neither is it possible for the number of
their respective Gunasthanas to be obtained at the same time in each of the four
Gunasthanas of the Upshamanika, nor is it possible for the number of their
respective Gunasthanas to be obtained at the same time in each of the four
Gunasthanas of the Kshapakshrenika. Yes, it is definitely possible for the
number of their respective Gunasthanas to be obtained in each Gunasthan of the
Upshamani and Kshapakani, respectively, at different times. Because, the beings
who ascend to the eighth Gunasthan of these categories in eight times, they
reach the ninth Gunasthan after a moment.

---------------------------
## सर्वार्थसिद्धि  This is a commentary on the text "Sarvarthasiddhi". It points
out several errors and inconsistencies in the text and provides corrections.
**Page 395, Line 14 (25-11):** The phrase "श्रेण्यसंख्येयभागप्रमिता:" seems to
be missing after "सूक्ष्ममनुष्यं प्रति मनुष्या मिथ्यादृष्टयः". This is because
the subsequent statement refers to both "manushya" (man) and "manuyini" (woman).
**Page 396, Line 9:** The phrase "तल्लक्षणसमचतुरस्ररज्जु" is difficult to
understand in terms of "ghanarajju" (cube-rope). This is because the text
defines "rajju" as an immeasurable number of yojanas (a unit of distance) in the
sky, and the universe is said to be 343 "dhanarajju" (treasure-rope) in size.
Therefore, in line 33 of the same page, "three hundred and forty-three rajju"
should be corrected to "three hundred and forty-three dhanarajju".  **Page 396,
Line 23:** The text states that the "Sāsādan" (a type of being) with
"Samyagdṛṣṭi" (right faith) is born everywhere except in the fire-bodied, air-
bodied, hellish, and all subtle beings. A verse is cited as evidence. However,
it is important to note that this being is also not born in the "Vikalatraya"
(three types of beings with disabilities), "Aparyāptakas" (insufficient beings),
and "Asanjnīs" (unconscious beings). The verse mentions that this being is born
in "Jinekaindriya" (one-sense beings), but at the time of birth, the
"Mithyātvagunasthan" (false belief) arises.  **Page 399, Lines 1 and 3:** The
phrase "Māraṇāntikādi" should be replaced with "Māraṇāntika" only. This is
because the "Upāpad" (state of being) is not possible in the "Sanjatāsanjata"
(state of being both restrained and unrestrained). Similarly, in line 4 of the
same page, it is important to note that in the "Sanjatāsanjata" state, the
"Śuklaleśyāma" (white and black) only has a "Māraṇāntika" (death-causing)
"Samudghāta" (impact) and is slightly less than six divided by fourteen "rajju"
(rope) in terms of "Sparśana" (touch). Also, in line 5, the phrase "Dyāpekṣayā"
should be followed by "ṣaṭrajjavaḥ-spaṣṭāḥ".  **Page 399, Lines 35-36:** In the
sentence "Sāsādanasya tatra sā na sambhavati", the word "sā" refers to the
"Māraṇāntikādi" (death-causing) state and means that it is not possible.  **Page
401, Line 27 onwards:** To calculate the "Utkṛṣṭakāla" (superior time) for a
single being with "Asanjatāsamyagdṛṣṭi" (unrestrained right faith), the
"Dhavala" (a commentary on the Jain scriptures) states on page 347 that a being
with the "Pramatta" (distracted) and other "Gunasthanas" (states of being) takes
birth in the "Anattara Vimāna" (highest celestial abode) after spending a time
equivalent to thirty-three "Sāgaropamas" (oceans). Then, after being expelled
from there, the being takes birth as a human with an age equivalent to a "Pūrva-
koṭi" (a very long period of time). When only an "Antarmūhurta" (a very short
period of time) remains, the being abandons "Asanjama" (unrestrained conduct)
and becomes "Sanjamī" (restrained). Thus, the "Utkṛṣṭakāla" obtained from this
"Sanjama" (restraint) is one "Pūrva-koṭi" less than the "Antarmūhurta" and
thirty-three "Sāgaropamas" less than the "Antarmūhurta".  **Page 402, Lines
42-1:** In the description of the "Utkṛṣṭakāla" for a "Pañcendriya Mithyādrṣṭi"
(five-sense being with false belief), the "Pūrva-koṭi" (a very long period of
time) is mentioned as 96. However, it should be 95 "Pūrva-koṭi" because the
final time spent in the "Purushavedīs" (a type of celestial abode) is only seven
"Pūrva-koṭi". Also, the text mentions that the being is born eight times as a
"Pañcendriya Aparyāpta" (five-sense being with insufficient knowledge). However,
this is not supported by the scriptures. The being is only born once as a
"Pañcendriya Aparyāpta" in the middle. See "Dhavala" page 3681.  **Page 406,
Lines 46-12, Line 33:** The text states that the being remains in the "Vedaka-
Samyaktva" (state of knowing the right path) for sixty-six "Sāgaropamas" for the
first time. However, it should be for sixty-six "Sāgaropamas" less than the
"Antarmūhurta" for the first time as well, just like the second time. This is
because, in the "Antarmūhurta", the being attains "Kṣāyika-Samyaktva" (state of
gradually attaining right faith) and eventually becomes "Kṛtyakṛtya-Vedaka-
Samyagdṛṣṭi" (one who knows the right and wrong actions). This is not the state
that is being considered here.  **Page 411, Lines 59-9, 14 onwards:** The text
uses the "Upacāra" (method of explanation) to prove that the
"Samyagmithyātvagunasthan" (state of being both right and wrong belief) is
"Kṣāyopaśamika" (a state of gradual decrease in wrong belief) and "Deśāghāti" (a
state of being harmful to the world). However, the "Dhavala" on page 198 states
that in the "Jātyantara-Svabhāva-Samyag

## Sarvarthasiddhi  **Page 416 (145.6, Line 23) onwards:** Those who are
*charamashariri* (have attained the final body) have an *anpavarya*
(imperishable) lifespan. This means that the lifespan they carry from their
previous births, which enables them to pierce the cycle of births and deaths,
does not increase in the final human existence. It is possible for their
lifespan to undergo *apvartan* (reduction) according to their merit. However,
the lifespan of a *charamashariri* being is *anpavarya*, therefore, it cannot be
pierced by the use of fire, poison, etc. This is the rule. This rule is
mentioned in the last sutra of the second chapter of the Tattvarthasutra. This
is what should be understood here. The word "uttama" (best) used as an adjective
in the said sutra should not be understood here as referring only to the body of
the Tirthankaras in Sarvarthasiddhi, etc. But the body of everyone is the best
because it is the final one. In the explanation of this sutra, Sarvarthasiddhi
also states: "There is no difference in meaning in the acceptance of the best,
which is the demonstration of the excellence of the final body."  **Page 427
(354-7, Line 32):** There are two types of *dashapurva* (those who have attained
the ten previous stages of liberation): *abhinnakshara dashapurva* (those who
have attained the ten previous stages without any change in their letters) and
*bhinnakshara dashapurva* (those who have attained the ten previous stages with
a change in their letters). Those who do not attain *moha* (delusion) upon
studying the *dashapurva* in the presence of *Rohini* (a type of celestial
being) and other great and small *vidya-devatas* (knowledge-deities) are called
*abhinnakshara dashapurva*. And those who attain *moha* are called *bhinnakshara
dashapurva*.  This is a brief description of the original *Sarvarthasiddhi-
vritti*, its translation, and the special corrections that came to our attention
in Appendix-2. There have been other corrections made in the translation, but
they are either general or merely clarifications, so we have not included them
in this description. However, we consider it appropriate to point out one or two
things here. Because the term used in the scriptures should be used in the
translation, etc. For example:  1. In the scriptures, the word *palyopam* is
used to convey the knowledge of a specific number, not the word *paly*.
Therefore, in our translation, we have accepted the word *palyopam* according to
the original and used it everywhere in place of *paly*. Similarly, *sagaropama*
has been used in place of *sagar*.  2. We have made this correction only in our
translation. This correction has not been made in the translation of Appendix-2,
so it should be understood there as well that *palyopam* should be used in place
of *paly* and *sagaropama* in place of *sagar* according to the above method.
3. Other Translations: 1. We do not have complete information about how many
other translations of *Sarvarthasiddhi-vritti* have been done. It is certain
that the first one is the *Bhasha-Vachanika* by Pandit Shri Jaychandji Chavḍa.
We have two editions of this. It is not clear from the printed copy where the
first edition was printed, because several of its initial pages are missing from
this copy. The second copy was printed by the Shruthabhandar and Granth
Prakashan Samiti, Falton. Looking at it, it becomes clear that it is written in
the form of *Bhasha-Vachanika*, therefore, even though it is a translation of
*Sarvarthasiddhi-vritti*, Panditji has also made special clarifications from his
side here and there. The printing method was not prevalent at that time,
therefore, the manuscript copy on which Panditji wrote his *Bhasha-Vachanika*
did not contain the text that we have separated from the original on page 17,
note 1. It is certain that the text which states the touching of the three
*leshya* (types of karma) of *Krishna* (a type of celestial being) and others,
who are *samyagdrsti* (rightly seeing) with three *leshya*, by saying
"Dwadashabhagaha kuto na labhyante" (Why are the twelve parts not obtained?),
etc., while mentioning the touching of *leshya* in the context of *leshya
margana* (the path of *leshya*) in comparison to *sparshan prarupana* (the form
of touching), is present in the manuscript copy from which Panditji translated.
But looking at the *sat* (being), *sankhya* (number), etc., *prarupana* (forms),
it becomes clear that this text is not from the original *Sarvarthasiddhi-
vritti*, and therefore, we have separated it from the original by giving it in
note no. 1 based on the second manuscript copy from Delhi.  2. It seems that
another *Bhasha-Vachanika* was also written by Pandit Shri Sadasuhaji, but we do
not have it, so we are not shedding any special light on it.

## 8] **Sarvarthasiddhi** 3. Jagaroop Sahayaji, a lawyer residing in Eta, also
undertook the task of writing a commentary on this. When the lawyer was
preparing this commentary, I had left my position as a Dharma-Adhyapaka
(religious teacher) at the Shri Syadvad Digambar Jain Mahavidyalaya. Therefore,
the lawyer invited me to Delhi to make necessary revisions and improvements in
the commentary, and I stayed there for a month and made the necessary revisions.
However, after the work was completed, I had to leave without any support. He is
also not present before us now, otherwise, I would have attempted to shed light
on the special features of the commentary.  Apart from these three, I am not
aware of anyone else who has written a Hindi translation of Sarvarthasiddhi or
its language-commentary. Visheshukim Adhikam.  4. **Acknowledgement** As I have
already mentioned in the beginning, the edition of Sarvarthasiddhi-Vrittika with
the erroneous translation that is before us is the second edition. The present
edition is to be printed without any changes, except for the revisions we have
made. We prepared this edition for printing at the behest of our esteemed
brother Lakshmichandraji of the Bharatiya Gyanpeeth, and we are deeply grateful
to him. We are also particularly grateful to Dr. Gulabchandraji. It is due to
his inspiration that we were able to revise and edit this edition in such a
short period. In preparing this edition, we have meticulously compared the
original text with the translation. And the necessary revisions have been made
in both the original and the translation. We have also re-examined the preface
word by word. It does not contain anything that is not supported by the Agamas.
It can be tested against the yardstick of the Agamas at any time. It was on this
very preface that we were not only welcomed and honored by the Vice-President of
India with a certificate of appreciation at the Dil Loke Vigyan Bhavan, but we
were also adorned with the honorary title of 'Siddhant Ratna'. All this is the
result of the wisdom of the revered Acharya Vidyānanda Mahārāj, and we are
deeply grateful to him. We wish that all the scholars in India who follow the
Agamas should be welcomed and honored in the same way. This is a time of
decline, and we sincerely hope that the tradition of scholarly scholars will
continue uninterrupted. The revered Acharya possesses all the qualities, and his
influence on society is unshakeable. If he takes this task in his hands, we do
not see any reason why it will not be successful. We are confident that it will
be successful.  5 July, 1983

Two Words 1. Due to Editing (From the First Edition) It has taken a long time
for Sarvarthasiddhi to be edited and published. About eight or nine years ago,
during a special reading, it came to my attention that there are many places in
Sarvarthasiddhi where some parts are doubtful to be considered its waste part.
But when a sentence, phrase, word or part of a word becomes a part of the
original text due to the carelessness of the scribe or other reasons, then it is
quite difficult to separate it without any basis. I faced this problem even
during the reading of Sarvarthasiddhi and as a result, I was inclined towards
its editing. It is clear that Acharya Pujyapada has explained the two sutras
'NirdessvAmitva' and 'Satsankhya' of the first chapter of Tattvarthasutra on the
basis of Shatkhandagama. We will discuss this further in the introduction by
writing a separate chapter. Here we only need to see if there is any laxity in
the explanation of these sutras and if there are any signs of laxity, what is
the reason for it? While explaining the sutra 'NissvAmitva', Acharya Pujyapada
has directed the master of Samyagdarshan with the shelter of all the four
motions. There, in support of the absence of Kshayik Samyagdarshan in
Tiryanchas, the following sentence is available in the previously printed
copies: 'Kuta Ityukte Manusyah Karmabhumij Ev Darshanamohakshapana Praarambhako
Bhavati. Apanapraarambhakalaparva Tiryaksha Baddhayushko'pi
Uttanabhogabhamitiryakpurushavevo Utpadhyate Na Tiryastree Shu: Dravyavedastree
Nanta Saan Kshayikasanbhavat. Evam Tirya Chamapya Paryapta Kanaan
Kshayopashaamikam Jneyam Na Paryapta Kanaam.' There is a directive of this type
of rule in the Agamas of both Digambar and Svetambar traditions that
Samyagdristi does not get born in the female bodies of any motion after death.
But in the Svetambar Agama, in the sixth Agama called Jnatadhakath, it is told
from the context of the story of Mallinath Tirthankar that Mallinath Tirthankar
had performed the karma called 'Stree Nama Karma' in his previous Mahabal bhav
due to Maya Char, due to which he became a woman in the Paryaya of Tirthankar.
And for this reason, the later Svetambar commentators have explained the above
rule as 'Samyagdristi does not become a woman after death, this is with respect
to Bahulya'. Here we do not need to consider the context of this story, we only
need to see what this 'Stree Nama Karma' is. Is it the 'Stree Ved' Nokshay out
of the nine Nokshays or is it directed by Angopaang? When this karma is bound in
the Paryaya of Mahabal, they were Samyagdristi Sadhu who bound the nature of
Tirthankar and there is a rule of Karma Shastra that Samyagdristi's 'Stree Ved'
is not bound because the binding of 'Stree Ved' is only up to the second
Gunasthan. Therefore, this binding karma cannot be the 'Stree Ved' Nokshay. As
for the matter of Angopaang, firstly, such a difference is not seen in
Angopaang. The differences of Avantaar... 1. See Study 8. 2. Therefore, from
this, Mahabal has been destroyed by this reason, this is the karma that destroys
them. Jnata 0 Page 312.

##  [10] **Sarvarthasiddhi**  If we assume a distinction, even then, according
to the principles of Karma Shastra, the binding of the unwholesome angopanga
takes place in the Pramattasanyata and Apramattasanyata Gunasthanas. This is not
possible because the binding and liberation of the unwholesome angopanga related
to Strived is possible only up to the second Gunasthan. Therefore, in the
present context, neither can this story from the Shatadharmakatha be considered
as a basis, nor does it seem appropriate to say on this basis that "a
Samyagdarshi Jiva does not take birth in Strivedis after death, this is said
with respect to the majority."  After considering all these points, when we pay
attention to the aforementioned statement of Sarvarthasiddhi, we have doubts
about it. It points out the reason for the absence of Kshayik Samyagdarshan in
Tiryanchis. It is clear that a human being who binds the Tiryanchayu and becomes
Samyagdarshi, attaining Kshayik Samyagdarshan, is born in the Tiryancha of the
Uttma Bhogbhumika, in the Purushavedi Tiryancha, not in the Strivedi Tiryancha.
But the argument given in support of this, "Dravyavedastriṇām tāsaṁ sāyikāsam-
bhavat," is not only flimsy but also misleading.  Based on this argument, the
meaning of the entire sentence is that since Kshayik Samyagdarshan is not
possible in Tiryancha Dravyavedi women, therefore, Kshayik Samyagdarshi Jivas
are born only in the Tiryancha Purushas of the Uttma Bhogbhumika after death.
Now, consider the entire context with a little more detail. The question is, in
a way, the same as the solution. We need to consider why Kshayik Samyagdarshan
does not occur in Tiryanchis. But it was sufficient to answer that if a bound
Tiryancha human being attains Kshayik Samyagdarshan, then he is born in the
Tiryancha Purushas of the Uttma Bhogbhumika after death, this is the rule. What
was the need for the statement "Dravyavedastriṇām tāsaṁ kṣāyikāsam-bhavat" as a
reason in support of it? This is what is called the same question and the same
answer.  Secondly, the phrase "Dravyavedastriṇām" here is not in accordance with
the Agama tradition and is therefore misleading, because the Agama classifies
Tiryancha, Tiryanchini, and Manushya, Manushyani, and the basis of these terms
is said to be the rise of Ved, Nokashaya.  We were faced with this question. We
had been thinking for a long time whether this sentence is the original part of
the text or whether it became a part of it later. Even after theoretical
consideration, the main basis for its decision was the ancient handwritten
copies. Accordingly, we started collecting copies from North India and South
India and comparing the doubtful places with the printed copies. As a result,
our assumption proved correct. Although this sentence is not absent in all the
copies, there were some ancient copies in which this sentence was not available.
In the explanation of this sutra, another sentence "Kṣāyikaṁ
punarbhavavedenaive" is printed. This sentence comes from the context of
Manushyanis. It is stated that it is possible for sufficient Manushyanis to
attain all three Samyagdarshans, but not for insufficient Manushyanis. This
sentence was created to indicate that Kshayik Samyagdarshan of Manushyani is
mainly said to be due to Bhavaved.  But it is clear that the term "Manushyani"
in the Agama is used only for the Jiva of the Manushya Gati who has the rise of
Strived. What is used in the world by the words Nari, Mahila, or Stri, according
to the Agama, the meaning of the word Manushyani is different from that. In such
a situation, if the above sentence is considered as the original, then two
meanings of the word Manushyani have to be accepted. One meaning is the
Manushyani who has the rise of Strived, and the other meaning has to be accepted
as a woman, whether she has the rise of Strived or not.  Even such a woman who
has the rise of Strived can be called Manushyani, and this sentence has come to
prohibit her Kshayik Samyagdarshan. If this is said, then there seems to be no
truth in this statement, because as we have said earlier, the word Manushyani is
used in the Agama mainly in the sense of Bhavaved, therefore, it is fulfilled
only in its own meaning. It is not its job to deal with other objections, it is
mainly the subject of Charananuyoga.

Two Words [11. We have also pondered over this sentence and researched it in all
the copies. By comparing the copies, it was found that this sentence is not
available in all the copies. Similarly, a sentence comes in the Leshya chapter
in the context of the explanation of the 'Satsankhya' etc. sutra. Which is as
follows: "Dvadashbhagaah kuto na labhyante, iti cet tatravashthitaleshyapekhya
panchaiva. Athava yesham mate saasadanekendriyeshu notpadyate tanmatapekshya
panchaiva." The chapter is about the touch of the Saasadan Samyagdristi Jivas
who have Krishna etc. Leshya. The Tiryanch and human Saasadan Samyagdristi Jivas
do not get born in hell after death. Those who go to Devagati or come from
Devagati do not have Krishna etc. inauspicious Leshyas. Those who come from hell
have both Krishna etc. inauspicious Leshyas and Saasadan Samyagdarshan. In this
regard, here the touch of the Saasadan Samyagdristi Jivas who have Krishna etc.
three inauspicious Leshyas has been said to be slightly less than five out of
fourteen Raju, slightly less than four out of fourteen Raju and slightly less
than two out of fourteen Raju respectively. . This is the opinion of the
Shatkhandagama. In Sarvarthasiddhi, the description of Sat, Sankhya and Kshetra
etc. Anuyogadwaras has been done according to the Shatkhandagama only. The
opinion of Kashayaprabhoot is different from this. According to him, the
Saasadan Samyagdristi Jivas are also born in Ekendriyas after death. Therefore,
in this regard, even though the touch of Saasadan Samyagdristi in Krishna Leshya
may become slightly less than twelve out of fourteen Raju, but according to the
intention of Shatkhandagama, this touch is not available in these Leshyas. We
had this question in front of us. Whenever our attention went to the sentence
"Dvadashbhagaah kuto na lamyante iti adi vachya" in Sarvarthasiddhi, we would
get into thought. The question was that if the Sarvarthasiddhikar wanted to
discuss the difference of opinion, then why did he not mention this difference
of opinion in other Anuyogadwaras like Satpraropa etc.? We paid attention to the
solution of this sentence in many ways, but in the absence of a proper solution,
we had to remain silent. This thought was definitely there that if the ancient
copies of Sarvarthasiddhi are taken recourse to, then it is possible that this
sentence may not be in them. We are happy to point out that our assumption
turned out to be correct. The palm leaf copies we got from Madbidri do not have
this sentence. On this basis, we can say with certainty that this sentence is
also not of Sarvarthasiddhi. First of all, the printing of the original
Sarvarthasiddhi was done by Kallappa Bharmappa Nitbene from Kolhapur. The second
printing was edited by Shri Motichandra Gotamchandra Kothari and was done from
Solapur. And the third time, Shriman Pandit Vanshidharji Solapurwala edited and
published it. Panditji has taken a lot of effort in editing it and this edition
is more accurate than other editions. Still, the important points of doubt that
we have drawn the attention of the readers to are still present in that edition.
The commentaries quoted below the Sarvarthasiddhi are also misleading at many
places. For example, in Kalapraroopanam, the excellent time of Saasadan
Samyagdristi is told to be the countless part of Aavali in comparison to various
Jivas in Anaharakas. Commenting on this, the commentator writes: "Aavali kaya
asankhyeyabhaga iti - sa cha aavali kaya asankhyeyabhagaah
samayamatralakshnatvat ekasamaya eva syat, aavlyaah
asankhyatasamayalakshnatvat." This means that that countless part of Aavali is
only one time because it is a sign of one time, because there are countless
times in one Aavali, therefore its countless part will be one time only. It is
clear that if the Acharyas wanted one time here, they would have indicated it by
the word "one time" itself. The explanation of the time of the countless part of
Aavali given in the Jeevasthan Kalanyogadwar is that many Saasadan Samyagdristi
remained Anaharaka for two times by separating into two bodies and the third

##  [12] Sarvarthasiddhi  In the time period, other Sasadan Samyagdrsti, by
becoming Anaharak, performed two Diras. In this way, continuously, for an
innumerable number of Avaliks, the Jivas remained Anaharak for two time periods.
Therefore, by multiplying the number of Avaliks by two, the total time period of
Anaharak Sasadan Samyagdrsti is obtained (Jivasthan Pu. 4).  In most of the
handwritten manuscripts, it is observed that, to clarify the subject matter,
verses, gathas, phrases, or independent commentaries from other texts are added
on many pages from the back, and over time, they become part of the text. This
anomaly has occurred to a very large extent in Sarvarthasiddhi. We have already
presented three such examples at the beginning of this statement. It must be
said that this is the ingenuity of some commentator, and he must have written
these sentences in the margin as footnotes to clarify the subject matter from
his perspective, and later, while preparing another copy from it, they became
part of the original text. Apart from this, there are many other phrases or
gathas that are not available in most of the handwritten manuscripts, and
removing them does not cause any harm to the subject matter. Here, we are
presenting two or three examples of such useful phrases that were present in the
ancient editions and have been separated from this edition.  1. In some copies,
in the commentary of the first sutra of the third chapter, the text 'Dhanam cha
Ghano Mandho Mahan Ayat Ityartha:' etc. is available. This text has also been
published in the printed editions so far. In the copies that were before us,
this text is not present in most of the copies, and considering the commentary,
it does not seem to be of the commentator, therefore, this text has not been
given above, but has been shown in the commentary below.  2. At the end of the
explanation of Malapariṣaha of the ninth sutra of the ninth chapter,
'Keshalanchasamskarabhyamutpannakhevasahanam Malasamanayasahane'ntarbhavatiti na
prithaguuktam.' This sentence is available in the printed editions. But this
sentence is not found in the handwritten copies that were before us. Considering
the sentence structure, it does not seem to be of Sarvarthasiddhi. Also, after
describing the nature of any Pariṣaha, there is no practice of further
clarification regarding that Pariṣaha in Sarvarthasiddhi, therefore, we have not
included this sentence in the original text, but have shown it separately in the
commentary.  3. Special Features of the Text Accepted in the Present Edition  We
have already mentioned that many editions of Sarvarthasiddhi have been published
before the present edition. In such a situation, we faced great difficulty in
accepting or rejecting any text during the editing of the present edition.
Generally, we have kept in mind that the texts available in the printed editions
should be given priority first. But we could not follow this rule everywhere. If
we found suitable texts from other handwritten manuscripts, we did not hesitate
to accept them.  4. Introduction to the Manuscript  There were many other things
that made us decide to re-edit it based on several ancient manuscripts. For
this, we obtained two palm leaf manuscripts from Moodbidri, two handwritten
manuscripts from the Delhi Bhandar, and one handwritten manuscript from the Jain
Siddhant Bhavan, Ara. From the printed editions, we had the editions edited by
Shri Pan. Kallappa Bharmappa Nitave and Shri Pan. Vanshidharji Solapur. In this
work, one palm leaf manuscript from Moodbidri and one handwritten manuscript
from the Delhi Bhandar proved to be particularly useful. These were more
accurate than other copies. Still, we could not consider any one as the main one
in the form of an ideal manuscript. We cannot say that the present edition of
Sarvarthasiddhi is final in all respects, but while editing it, this point was
definitely kept in mind.

Two Words [13  It has been made as accurate and traditional as possible
according to the Agamas. Before introducing the copies, we would like to clarify
that it took an inordinate amount of time for Sarvarthasiddhi to come to light.
During this long period, we had to make many changes and faced many obstacles.
As a result, we were unable to keep all our documents safe. We lost many useful
documents, which caused us great loss. These documents also included the
introduction to the copies, so the complete introduction to the copies that we
had written is not available to us at this time. The copies on which we based
this work are also not available to us. Nevertheless, thanks to our friends Shri
Pandit K. Bhujabaliji Shastri Moodbidri and Pandit Darbarilalji Nyayacharya
Delhi, we are providing here the introduction to the copies of the said places
that we have obtained. (1) Ta.—This is a palm leaf manuscript from Moodbidri.
The script is Kannada. There are 116 leaves in total. Each page has 10 lines and
each line has about 71 characters. The copy is clean and in good condition.
Saraswati Gachchha, Balatkar Gan Kundakundanvaya's A. Vasundhara completed the
script on Bhadrapaada Krishna Pratipada, Shalika Shaka 1551, Vilambi Samvatsara.
This was the oldest of the copies available to us. Its code is Ta. (2) Na.—This
is also a palm leaf manuscript from Moodbidri. The script is Kannada. There are
101 leaves in total. Each page has 9 lines and each line has about 107
characters. The copy is clean and in good condition. It does not mention the
scribe or the date of writing. Its code is Na. (3) Di. 1 This is a handwritten
copy of Di. Jain Saraswati Bhandar Dharmpura Delhi, located in the new temple of
Shri Lala Harsukhray Suganchandji. The number of leaves is 201. Each leaf has 18
lines and each line has about 33 characters. The length of the leaf is 11 inches
and the width is 5 inches. The copy has been made in the middle, leaving one
inch margin on all sides. The paper is strong, the characters are also very
beautiful, which can be read easily without any difficulty. The writing work was
completed on Ashadha Sudi 11, Thursday, Samvat 1752. The following eulogy is
available at the end of the copy: 'Pranipatya Jinavrendram
Varavigraharooparanjitasurendra. Sadgunasudhasamudra Vakyase Staam
Prasastimhaan. . . . . Jagatsare Hi Sare'sminnahimsajalasaagare. Nagare
Nagarakiarna Vistirnapanapannyake. . . 2|| Ch. Samvat 17521 Varshe Ashadha Sudi
11 Gurau Lishayitadhyatmaratparasaseshjnaanavaraneekshayarth Likhitam.' Its code
is Di. 1. (4) Di. 2 This is also a handwritten copy from the aforementioned
place. The number of leaves is 111. Each leaf has 12 lines and each line has
about 50 characters. Only the first and last leaves have fewer lines. The length
of the leaf is 11 and a quarter inches and the width is 5 inches. The copy has
been made leaving one and a quarter inch margin on the sides and three-quarters
of an inch margin on the top and bottom. The writing at the end of the copy
indicates that this copy was completed on Tuesday, Ashwin Vadi 14, Samvat 1875.
The writing is as follows: 'Samvat 1875 Masottamamase Ashwinimase Krishnapakse
Tithau Cha Shubh Chaturdashi Bhamiwasarena Likhitam Jaisinghpuramadyhe
Piragadasa Mohaka Jainee Bhai.' It is evident from seeing this copy that it was
probably written based on Di. 1. The copyist is Shri Piragadasa Ji Jain and it
was prepared while sitting in the Narasimhapur (New Delhi) Jain temple. Its code
is Di. 2. Apart from these copies, there is a fifth copy from Shri Jain Siddhant
Bhavan Ara. These copies were used during the reading. And during the printing,
a copy from Khimalasa village, which falls under Sagar district of Madhya
Pradesh, was also available. This village was once a prosperous town. It is
located on the road from Bina Etawah to Malthaun and is about 12 miles away from
Bina Etawah. Ancient records indicate that its ancient

## 14] **Sarvarthasiddhi** The name is Kshemollas. Khimlasa is its corrupted
form. The rampart and ruins around the city are evidence of the prosperity of
the ancient city. The Jain temple here is worth seeing. It has a Saraswati
Bhavan which still houses many ancient handwritten copies of scriptures.  4. The
reason for the delay in publication is that we edited it independently. We had
to gather the necessary materials for editing ourselves. Once the work was
underway, we hoped to publish it very soon. One or two literary organizations
were also ready to publish it, but matching the text from multiple copies,
adding annotations, and translating it took longer than we expected. As a
result, the work fell behind schedule. Meanwhile, in VS 2003, the Shri Ganesh
Prasad Varni Jain Granthamala was established to honor the services of the
revered Shri 105 Kshu. Ganesh Prasadji Varni, and it was decided that
Sarvarthasiddhi would be published under this Granthamala. Accordingly, it was
given to Shri Bhargav Bhushan Press for printing. However, due to the press's
delay and the emergence of other urgent tasks before the Granthamala, its
publication was delayed considerably.  5. This year, we were just about to
complete the printing when, on the one hand, the institution accepted the task
of writing a history of Jain literature, and on the other hand, several other
financial and other obstacles arose before the Granthamala, which, keeping in
mind, the Granthamala, with my consent, stopped its publication and gave me the
right that if the Indian Knowledge Institute could complete this work, then this
book would be gratefully handed over to the Indian Knowledge Institute on proper
grounds. Keeping in mind the intention of the Granthamala, I discussed this
matter with the worthy minister of the Indian Knowledge Institute, Shriman Pan.
Ayodhyaprasadji Goyali. Goyali ji gave only one answer that if the Shri G. Varni
Jain Granthamala is facing difficulties in publishing Sarvarthasiddhi due to
lack of funds or any other reason, then the Indian Knowledge Institute will not
let it remain unpublished. It will not only complete the remaining work after
printing, but will also happily return the expenses incurred by the Varni
Granthamala on it. Generally, we considered it very difficult to get this work
done from the Indian Knowledge Institute before the discussion, because the
sequence and special features of its publications, we found a lot of lack in the
printed forms of Sarvarthasiddhi. But we are extremely happy to point out here
that nothing stood in the way of this. This not only introduced us to the
generous heart of Shri Goyali ji, but it is also a clear example of the vast
vision that is adopted in the operation of the Indian Knowledge Institute.  6.
Some of our friends and well-wishers, who have provided financial and other
assistance to the Granthamala in its publication, will be surprised to see that
Sarvarthasiddhi has been published by the Indian Knowledge Institute. But it is
a very small question as to which institution is publishing this book. The only
thing they need to see is whether the money or other assistance they have given
for the betterment of literature is being used properly or not. Generally,
different institutions are established for the convenience of management and
workers. But they are all branches of the same great tree. It doesn't matter
which fruit is on which branch. What matters is...

Two Words [15 So the question is whether every branch and twig of that great
tree, and its other parts, are performing their proper functions in their
respective places. The insistence on name and form has never been desirable in
the Jain tradition, and should not be. It is given a place only for the conduct
of behavior. Therefore, whether the publication of Sarvarthasiddhi was done by
the Varni Granthamala or by the Bharatiya Gyanpith, both things are one. 7.
Expression of Gratitude Still, it seems absolutely necessary to express our
gratitude in a few words to our colleagues, friends, and well-wishers from many
perspectives. It is a definite fact that the Jain community has not paid as much
attention to the publication of Jain literature as it should have. In ancient
times, both the establishment of temples and the recording of scriptures and
their establishment here and there were considered equal. Until now, the
protection of scriptures has been done through this method. Our ancestors,
whether they were knowledgeable about those scriptures or not, considered it
their sacred duty to protect the scriptures by having them copied, and they were
also engaged in this work, but since the printing work began, in a way, society
has closed its eyes to this. Now, let alone copying, they have become hesitant
to even buy a single printed copy of them. Forget about spending money
personally, they don't even want to accomplish this work with public funds,
while they continue to use this money for other showy and temporary works. Their
argument is that who here understands such large books? What will we do by
keeping them in the temple? If the ancient men had worked with this same logic,
would it have been possible to protect literature? It is difficult to say that
we have saved all our literature. However, whatever has been saved is enough.
This literature is the only means capable of establishing a direct connection
with the life and teachings of Lord Mahavira. Therefore, it becomes the duty of
every householder to use every possible means to protect it. It is a matter of
joy that the founders and other workers of the Bharatiya Gyanpith have paid
sufficient attention to this, and without considering whether the expenses
incurred on its publication etc. will be recovered or not, they are paying
attention to the publication of all kinds of ancient literature. The publication
of Sarvarthasiddhi by the Bharatiya Gyanpith is the result of their same
auspicious sentiment, therefore, we consider it our duty to express our
gratitude to them first in humble words. As the editor of Sarvarthasiddhi, it is
our duty to do this work, and as the conductor of the Varni Granthamala, we also
have to perform it. Shri G. Varni Jain Granthamala is an institution that has
the support of the well-established scholars of society, therefore, the
publication of Sarvarthasiddhi by it was not a difficult task, yet considering
the difficult situation it faced, the way it has made a commendable start, we
consider it our duty to express our gratitude to the management committee of the
Varni Granthamala. Here, we also consider it our duty to express our gratitude
to those great souls who, due to their interest in the publication of only
Sarvarthasiddhi, had given their generous assistance to the Varni Granthamala.
The generous donors are: 1. Shriman Bro. Lakshmichandraji Varni, by the advice
of the revered Shri 108 Acharya Suryasagarji Maharaj. Varniji had sent 1500) for
this work from the society of Delhi's Pahari Dheeraj and Deputyganj. 2. Babu
Ramswaroopji Baruasagar, the treasurer of the Varni Granthamala. You had
provided 1601) for this work. 3. The generous-minded Shriman Nemchand Balchandji
Sa. Vakil Usmanabad. Your granddaughter Bro. Gajrabai had come to Banaras to
study Labdhisar Kshapanasar, and she stayed here for about two months. As a
result, inspired by sister Gajrabai, Vakil Sa. had given 1000) to the
Granthamala.

## Introduction (From the First Edition)  "Who am I, what is my nature, where
did I come from, what is conducive to me, and how is it attained? The human
being who does not contemplate these things is not capable of attaining their
destination."  Acharya Vadi Singh has said these words in the Kshatracharamaṇi
in the context of Tattvajñāna. This clearly conveys the duty of a human being.
The contemplation of duty is the essence of life. Even those who are Tiryanch
consider their duty and act accordingly, so the case of humans is even more
significant.  In the life of every being, we see such extraordinary
transformations that are unimaginable. Why does this happen? Is the external
environment the only reason for this? A father has two children. They are raised
in the same way. They receive education in the same school, yet there is a
remarkable difference in their character and temperament. Why? There must be
some unknown reason besides their physical structure. The seekers have deeply
pondered this question. In response, they have given the world this experience:
due to the karmas accumulated according to the inherent capabilities of the
being, such diversity is seen in the lives of beings.  Observing the diversity
of the world, they have said that the first state of this being is Nigoda. From
time immemorial, this being has been eligible for this state. It is as rare to
find a grain of sand in a vast expanse of sand as it is to escape from this
state and attain another state. There is no count of other states. It is as rare
for this being to become Panchendriya while wandering through them as it is for
a human being to attain the quality of gratitude even after acquiring all other
qualities. Even if it becomes Panchendriya, it does not benefit it much, because
the state of being a human being is the only state where it can gather all the
means for its progress. But attaining this is very difficult. The seekers have
expressed this in these words through an example. They say that just as it is
rare to find a heap of jewels placed on a crossroads, it is equally rare to find
the human state while wandering through other states. Even if it attains the
human state, it is even rarer to follow the path of duty by understanding its
duties and non-duties.  Being human, this being gets entangled in countless
attachments. Sometimes it worries about its children, wife, and home, and
sometimes it spends its time worrying about its prestige. Its mind is not even
slightly attracted towards self-realization. It worries about what is not its
own, and it does not even look at what is its own. The result is that it does
not cherish this rare human state with pride, but due to the lack of
understanding of the right duty, it has to become eligible for endless torments
again.

##  **Sarvarthasiddhi**  How can this being be liberated from this state? In
response to this question, seekers have shown many paths, of which the study of
**Samyak Shruta** is the most important. Shruta is of two types: one that guides
towards fulfilling worldly desires, and the other that, by showing the path of
**vishaya** and **kashaya** as inappropriate, sets one on the path of self-
benefit. What is the benefit of the soul? If we have to get the answer to this
question in brief, it can only be said that it is '**moksha**'. Therefore, the
scripture that has a proper understanding of the means of attaining moksha is
eligible to be called **Samyak Shruta**.  From this perspective, when we look at
ancient literature, our attention first goes to the **Dwadashanga Shruta**. It
has a direct connection to the words of **Lord Mahavira**. It is a fact that all
**Tirthankaras** preach the meaning, and their chief disciples, who are called
**Ganadharas**, create **Anga Shruta** in the form of scriptures. This is mainly
divided into twelve sections, hence it is called **Dwadashanga**, and because it
is composed by the chief heads of the Sangha, the **Ganadharas** - **Ganis**, it
is also called **Ganipitaka**.  After **Lord Mahavira** attained **moksha**,
there were three **Anubaddha Kevalis** and five **Shruta Kevalis**. The last
**Shruta Kevali** was **Bhadrabahu**. Until him, this **Anga Shruta** came in
its original form. After that, due to the gradual decline of **buddhibal** and
**dharanashakti**, and the lack of a tradition of writing down scriptures, it
gradually became fragmented. Thus, on the one hand, while the **Anga Shruta**
was disappearing, on the other hand, efforts were also being made to keep the
**Shruta** tradition unbroken and to maintain its direct connection to the words
of **Lord Mahavira**.  After **Anga Shruta**, the second place is given to
**Ananga Shruta**. It is also called **Anga Bahya**. Its main divisions are:
**Samayik, Chaturvishati Stav, Vandana, Pratikraman, Vanayik, Kritikarma,
Dashakalik Uttaradhyayana, Kalpavyavahar, Kalpyakalpya, Mahakalypa, Pundarika,
Maha Pundarika, and Nishiddvika**. Out of these, **Sarvarthasiddhi** mentions
only **Uttaradhyayana** and **Dashakalik**. Based on the **Shri Dhavala Tika**,
it is known that these were also composed by the **Ganadharas**, and they were
present during the existence of **Anga Shruta**. But gradually, due to the lack
of **Shramanas** who could hold them like **Anga Shruta**, they also
disappeared. As a result, in the **Svetambara** tradition, which is completely
deprived of the original **Shruta**, the **Acharaanga** etc. **Anga Shruta** and
**Uttaradhyayana** etc. **Ananga Shruta** that are available are a collection
from after the fifth century Vikram, therefore, it cannot be considered
particularly useful from the perspective of the original **Shruta**. Thus, it
took a total of 683 years for the **Anga Shruta** and **Anga Bahya Shruta** to
become fragmented.  But this does not mean that we did not receive any form of
inheritance of the words of **Lord Mahavira**, or the **Dwadashanga** words, in
later times. During the time of **Bhadrabahu Shruta Kevali**, the Jain tradition
was divided into two 'parts'. The first tradition, which accepted the
**tattvajnanamulak** conduct of **Lord Mahavira** and his previous
**Tirthankaras** without any modification, was known at that time as the
**Digambara** tradition or the original platform, and the one that, due to
circumstances, made modifications and introduced new conduct, became known as
the **Pravetambara** tradition. Due to this, the original **Anga Shruta** and
**Ananga Shruta** could not be written down, but over time, there have been
**Acharyas** who have tried to protect the **Shruta** with the help of **Anga
Shruta**. The composition of **Shatkhandagam** and **Kashaya Prabhriti** is the
first among those efforts. **Acharya Kundakunda**, who lived around the same
time, by his spiritual style, while considering the **jivadi** elements and the
conduct in accordance with the path of **moksha**, not only tried to protect the
independent path of the **Tirthankaras**, but also brought a lot of stability to
it. In this way, many efforts have been made by **Arayatiya Acharyas** to create
**Shruta** in accordance with the original **Shruta** and to protect it. The
**Shruta** that can be counted first in the entire Jain tradition from the
perspective of composition is described briefly as follows:

## Introduction  **Book Name:** Shatkhandagama **Author:** Acharya Pushpadanta
Bhootbali **Time of Composition:** Second century BCE or earlier
**Kshayaprabhrut:** Acharya Gunadhar **Contemporary Kshayaprabhrut:** Acharya
Yativrishabha, who lived some time after Acharya Gunadhar. **Samayaprabhrut,
Pravachansaraprabhrut:** Acharya Kundakunda, who lived in the first and second
centuries BCE. **Panchaastikayaprabhrut, Niyamsar and Ashtaprabhrut Mulaachar
(Aacharaang):** Acharya Vattakeer **Contemporary of Acharya Kundakunda:**
Acharya Sivary, author of Mulaaradhana (Bhagavati Aaradhana) and Tattvarthsutra.
**Contemporary or slightly later than Acharya Kundakunda:** Acharya Giddhapicchi
**Contemporary or slightly later than Acharya Kundakunda:** Acharya
Samantabhadra, author of Ratnakaranḍa Shravakaachar.  After Acharya Kundakunda,
there were many efforts to preserve the scriptures. The compilation of the
Shvetambar Angascriptures is one of those efforts. It was compiled and put into
book form in the 6th century CE.  **1. Tattvarthsutra:** Among these, we need to
consider the Tattvarthsutra. It is the main text of Jain philosophy. It
discusses all aspects of Jain conduct and Jain philosophy in a sutra style. It
is certain that Jain  **1.** There is a lot of debate about the time of these
individuals. Veerasen Swami has written that they were disciples of Vaachaka
Aryamanksu and Nagahasta. Both of these are mentioned in the Shvetambar
Pattavalis. It is possible that these and Aryama and Nagahasta mentioned in the
Shvetambar tradition are the same person, and they appear to be the guru of
Acharya Yativrishabha. In the Dhavala commentary of Jeevasthan
Kshetrapramananugama, Acharya Veerasen has mentioned a Tiloayapanṇatti which is
different from the current Tiloayapanṇatti. It is possible that some part of it
has been included in the current Tiloayapanṇatti, but this does not prove their
identity. Pandit Jugalkishorji Mukhtar, in the introduction to the Puratan Jain
Vakyasuchi, has tried to refute my article published in an issue of Jain
Siddhant Bhaskar, which attempts to prove the identity of the current
Tiloayapanṇatti with the ancient Tiloayapanṇatti. This cannot be called a proper
attempt, because the current Tiloayapanṇatti does not mention the size of the
universe as discussed in the ancient Tiloayapanṇatti. Based on this, it seems
completely appropriate to believe that the position of Acharya Yativrishabha
based on the calculation of the reign period based on the current
Tiloayapanṇatti is also not appropriate. For this, it will first have to be
proven that this calculation of the reign period is also found in the ancient
Tiloayapanṇatti, only then this belief will be considered appropriate that
Acharya Yativrishabha lived a thousand years after Mahavira Samvat. According to
the immediate mention in Dhavala, Acharya Yativrishabha should be considered to
be of the same time as those two great Acharyas who adorned this earth, as he
was a disciple of Mahavaachaka Aryamanksu and Nagahasta.  **2.** Indranandi has
also mentioned the commentary of Acharya Kundakunda on Shatkhandagama in his
Shrutavatar. Based on this, the time of composition of Shatkhandagama is before
the first century. Most thinkers place these texts after a tradition of 683
years, but in my opinion, the purpose of showing the order in which the
tradition of Shruta came is only to show that. If the authors of Shatkhandagama
etc. lived 683 years ago, there is no objection to it.

**The Sarvarthasiddhi**  The primary language of the **Kagama-mathu** has been
Prakrit, and the **Shruta** (scriptural texts) compiled by the Indian
**Acharyas** (teachers) outside of Bengal is also mostly written in Prakrit. The
various forms of Prakrit that are available confirm that it was the language of
the common people for a long time, even before the time of Lord Mahavira and
after. Pali, in which important ancient Buddhist literature is available, is a
dialect of Prakrit. From the beginning, the Jains and Buddhists have had a
nature to teach the common people in their language. As a result, they have done
most of their literary work in the language of the people, Prakrit. But
gradually, with the dominance of Brahmanism in India and their literary language
being Sanskrit, the Buddhists and Jains were forced to write their useful
literature in Sanskrit as well. This is why the important text **Tattvartha
Sutra** was written in Sanskrit. This is the first text written in Sanskrit in
the Jain tradition. There is no definite evidence that Jain literature was
written in Sanskrit before this. The **Tattvartha Sutra** is a short **Sutra**
text, but it contains a good collection of **Pramays** (principles). For this
reason, it has been adopted equally by all the sects of the Jain tradition. It
has been equally well-received in the philosophical world as well as the
spiritual world. From this point of view, the **Tattvartha Sutra** is considered
to be as important in the Jain tradition as the **Gita** is to the Vedic people,
the **Bible** to the Christians, and the **Quran** to the Muslims. Most Jains
recite it daily, and some recite one chapter of it every day on the **Ashtami-
Chaturdashi** days of the **Dasha-lakshana Parva**, which is listened to with
great devotion by the common people. It is said that whoever recites it once in
their lifetime gets the benefit of a fast.  **Name**  The main name of this
**Sutra** text is **Tattvartha**. This name is mentioned by its main
commentators. In the **Sarvarthasiddhi**, this sentence appears at the end of
each chapter:  "**Iti Tasyarthavritta, Sarvarthasiddhishikayaam Adhyayah
Samaptas**" (Thus ends the meaning of this, in the **Sarvarthasiddhi**
commentary).  At the end of the **Sarvarthasiddhi**, there are three verses of
praise, in which the present commentary is called **Tattvarthavritti**, and the
name of the present text is declared as **Tattvartha**. The same is the case
with the **Tattvarthavartika** and the **Tattvartha Shloka-vartika**. In the
first auspicious verse of both these commentary texts, and in the concluding
verses of each chapter, the same name of the original text is mentioned.  There
are seven **Tattvarthas** - **Jiva**, **Ajeeva**, **Asava**, **Bandha**,
**Samvara**, **Nirjara**, and **Moksha**. The present **Sutra** text elaborates
on these seven **Tattvarthas** in relation to **Samyagdarshan** (right faith).
It seems that this is why it got the name **Tattvartha**.  In the common world,
it is also known as **Tattvartha Sutra**. This name is mentioned by **Vira Sena
Swami** in his famous commentary **Dhavla**. **Siddhasena Gani** also mentions
this name in the concluding verses of some chapters in his commentary. It seems
that it got its second name **Tattvartha Sutra** because it discusses the seven
**Tattvarthas** (Jiva, etc.) in the style of a **Sutra**. But since the word
**Sutra** is added to the previous name, it is possible that both names are the
same. It is possible that the name **Tattvartha Sutra** is used only for
convenience.

## Translation:  **21**  It has been mentioned elsewhere as 'Tattvarth' and also
as 'Sattvarthsutra'. It is an old practice to refer to an object by mentioning a
part of its name, and to convey its meaning. It is very likely that this is how
it got the name 'Tattvarth'. Siddhasen Ganini has mentioned it by both the names
'Tattvarthsutra' and 'Tattvarth'. This also confirms that both names refer to
the same thing.  **Introduction**  One of its names is also 'Moksha Shastra'. We
have not seen this name mentioned by ancient commentators or anyone else.
However, it is widely known in the public. The 'Tattvarthsutra' begins with the
teachings of the path to liberation and ends with the teachings of liberation.
It seems that this is why it has gained such popularity.  After 'Sarvarth
Siddhi', 'Tattvarthbhahya' is considered to be its second important commentary.
This verse appears in its 'Uththaniaka':  "Tattvarthabhigamasya barsha sangraham
laghupram yam. Vakyami shishya hita mim adra vanakadeshasya || 2 ||"  Meaning: I
am speaking this short treatise called 'Tattvarthadhigam', which is full of
meaning and a collection of its own part, for the benefit of the students.  The
praise that is available at the end of 'Tattvarthbhahya' also mentions the name
'Tattvarthadhigam'. Based on this, it is said that its main name is
'Tattvarthadhigam'.  However, even with this basis, we have doubts about this
being the name of the original sutra text. Firstly, these verses of
'Uththaniaka' and the praise found at the end of the commentary are not part of
the original sutra text, but are part of the commentary, and the commentary is a
work done after the sutra was composed. Secondly, the independent copy of the
commentary available with 'Tattvarthsutra' does not indicate through the
concluding flower verses of each chapter that the commentator Umaswati considers
'Tattvarthbhahya' to be different from 'Tattvarthadhigam'. The concluding flower
verse of the first chapter is as follows:  "Iti Tattvarthadhigame arhatpravachan
sangrahe prathamo adhyayah samaptas."  Generally, if a concluding flower verse
is written for a chapter of an independent text, it only mentions the name of
the original text and indicates the end of the chapter. And if a concluding
flower verse is written for a chapter along with the commentary, it mentions the
name of the original text, or without mentioning it, mentions the name of the
commentary and indicates the end of the chapter. For example, the concluding
flower verse of a chapter of 'Tattvarthsutra' is available as follows:  "Iti
Tattvarthsutre prathamo adhyayah samaptas."  Similarly, the concluding flower
verse of 'Tattvarthsutra' along with the commentary is as follows:  "Iti
Tattvarthvrittau Sarvarthsiddhisanjnakaayaam prathamo adhyayah samaptas."  Here,
Pujyapada Swami has mentioned only the name of his commentary 'Tattvarthvritti'
along with its name, without mentioning the independent name of
'Tattvarthsutra'. This clearly shows that there is an independent text called
'Tattvarth' and this is a commentary written on it. It is very likely that the
same situation was in front of the commentator Umaswati while writing the
concluding flower verses of each chapter. This shows that:  1. See, Siddhasen
Ganini commentary chapter one and six concluding flower verses. 2. See, Ratlam
Seth Rishabhdevji Kesharimalji Jain Shwetamber Sanstha published
'Tattvarthbhahya' copy.

## Sarvarthasiddhi  They are referring to the "Tattvarthaadhigama
Arhatpravachansangraha" commentary, which they consider an independent text on
Tattvartha. It is clear that the name "Tattvarthaadhigama" belongs to the
commentary by Uma Swami, not to the Tattvarthasutra itself.  Two versions of the
sutra text are available: one accepted by the Digambara tradition and the other
by the Svetambara tradition. We will discuss the original form of the sutra text
before the composition of Sarvarthasiddhi and Tattvarthabhashya in due course.
The main purpose here is to provide a general introduction to these two sutra
texts.  According to the Digambara tradition, the sutra numbers in the ten
chapters are as follows: 33+53+39+42+42+27+39+26+47+9 = 357. According to the
Svetambara tradition, the sutra numbers in the ten chapters are as follows:
35+52+18+53+44+26+34+26+49+7 = 344.  There are five main points in the first
chapter where the two sutra texts differ fundamentally. The first point is the
sutra that discusses the four types of matigyan. Here, the Digambara tradition
accepts the "avay" reading, while the Svetambara tradition accepts the "apaya"
reading. Prajnachchhu Pandit Sukhlalji, while discussing the Tattvarthasutra
accepted by the Svetambara tradition, mainly accepts the "avay" reading. The
second point is the sutra that discusses the 12 substances that are the objects
of matigyan. Here, the Digambara tradition accepts the reading "anisritanukt-",
while the Svetambara tradition accepts the reading "anishritasandhight-". The
difference in meaning is clear due to the difference in reading. The third point
is the sutra "dvividho'vadhi:". The Svetambara tradition considers this a sutra,
while in Sarvarthasiddhi, it is part of the utthanika of the sutra
"bhavapratyayavadhivanarakaanaam". The fourth point is the sutra that discusses
the second type of avadhigyan. Here, the Digambara tradition accepts the reading
"kshayopashamanimittah", while the Svetambara tradition accepts the reading
"yathoktanimittah". The fifth point is the sutra that discusses the seven naya.
Here, the Digambara tradition considers all seven naya as original and mentions
them equally. However, the Svetambara tradition considers five naya as original
and mentions the naigama and shabdnaya separately through two and three
different sutras respectively. Generally, seven naya are considered original in
both the Digambara and Svetambara traditions, and they are also mentioned as
original naya in the Agamic literature. However, when considering which naya
accepts which niksepa from the namadi niksepas, five naya, including naigama,
are often mentioned. It is very likely that seeing this practice, Uma Swami may
have considered five naya as original, and there is no surprise in that.  There
are two main points in the second chapter. The first point is the sutra that
discusses the parinaamik bhavas. After listing the three names of parinaamik
bhavas, the Svetambara tradition accepts the adi pada, while the Digambara
tradition does not. Here, while explaining the true nature of the jiva, the
parinaamik bhavas are mentioned. The Digambara tradition does not mainly count
other dravya and ordinary parinaamik bhavas here, while the Svetambara tradition
does, and this is the purpose of giving the adi pada here. The second point is
the sutra that discusses the types of sthavarakayik jivas. According to the
Agamic practice, both traditions accept five types of sthavaras, and the
Digambara tradition accepts five types here according to the same practice.
However, the Svetambara tradition considers agnikayik and vayukayik jivas as
gatitras and mentions them along with the trasas. This has led to differences in
the composition of several sutras. The third point is the sutra "upayogah:
sparshadish". The Svetambara tradition considers it an independent sutra, while
the Digambara tradition does not consider it a sutra.  1. See, Dhavala book,
12th Vedana Pratyay Vidhan named Adhikar. See, Kashayaprabhut Pra. book,
appendix page 71.

## Introduction  The Digambara and Svetambara traditions differ in their
acceptance of certain sutras (aphorisms) within the Tattvartha Sutra.   **Fourth
Sutra:** The Digambara tradition accepts the sutra "Ekasamyaavigraha" as it is,
while the Svetambara tradition considers it to be about "Ekasamya" (oneness) and
uses the masculine singular form.  **Fifth Sutra:** The Digambara tradition
accepts the term "Pot" while the Svetambara tradition accepts "Potja" in the
sutra about birth.  **Sixth Sutra:** The Digambara tradition accepts the sutra
"Taijasamipi" while the Svetambara tradition does not. The Svetambara tradition
considers the discussion about the causes of the origin of all "Nimittaja"
(caused) bodies to be part of the Tattvartha Bhashya (commentary) rather than a
separate sutra.  **Seventh Sutra:** The Digambara tradition uses the phrase
"Pramattasanyatasyaeva" while the Svetambara tradition uses
"Chaturdashapurvadharasyava" in the sutra about the Aharak (food) body.
**Eighth Sutra:** The Digambara tradition considers the sutra "Seshaastrivedah"
to be independent, while the Svetambara tradition rejects it based on the
"Parisesha Nyaya" (principle of residue).  **Ninth Sutra:** The Digambara
tradition uses the phrase "Charamottamadeha" while the Svetambara tradition uses
"Charmadehotamapurusha" in the sutra about those who have not attained
liberation.  **Third Chapter:**  * **First Sutra:** The Svetambara tradition
adds the phrase "Prithutarah" after "Adho'dhah" in the first sutra. * **Second
Sutra:** The Svetambara tradition does not accept the term "Narakah" (hell) in
the second sutra and considers it a separate sutra "Tasun Narakah". The
Svetambara tradition considers the four sutras from the second onwards to be
about the state of hell, while the Digambara tradition considers them to be
about the state of all hell-like places. * **Eleventh Sutra onwards:** The
Digambara tradition accepts the 21 sutras after the eleventh sutra as separate
sutras, while the Svetambara tradition does not.  **Fourth Chapter:**  *
**Second Sutra:** The Digambara tradition accepts the sutra "Aditastrishu
Pitantaleshya" while the Svetambara tradition accepts "Tritiyah Pitaleshyah".
The Svetambara tradition considers the "Pitantaleshya" to be a type of
astrologer, which led to the difference in interpretation and the Svetambara
tradition accepting a separate sutra "Pilantaleshya" at the seventh position. *
**Sutra about Kalpas (epochs):** The Svetambara tradition accepts the phrase
"Dvayordvayoh" in the sutra about the investigation of the remaining Kalpas,
which leads them to consider the four Kalpas (Anata, etc.) as two. * **Sutra
about Kalpas:** The Digambara tradition mentions sixteen Kalpas while the
Svetambara tradition mentions twelve. * **Sutra about Laukantika Devas (worldly
gods):** The Digambara tradition mentions eight types of Laukantika Devas while
the Svetambara tradition mentions nine. However, the Tattvartha Bhashya mentions
only eight types. * **Sutra "Aupapaddhikamanushyebhyah" onwards:** There are
significant differences in the sutra readings between the two traditions in this
chapter. Many sutras accepted by the Svetambara tradition are not found in the
Digambara tradition. Some sutras have different readings in the two traditions.
**Fifth Chapter:**  * **"Dravyani" and "Jivaasch" sutras:** The Digambara
tradition considers these two sutras separately, while the Svetambara tradition
considers them as one. * **Sutra about the number of regions of Dharma, Adharma,
and Anekant**: The Digambara tradition mentions the number of regions for
Dharma, Adharma, and Anekant, while the Svetambara tradition does not.

---------------------------
The 24th chapter of the text discusses the concept of "Sarvarthasiddhi" (all-
encompassing success) and its relation to the "Jiva" (soul). The Digambara
tradition considers the "Jiva" as a separate entity, while the Svetambara
tradition treats it as a part of the "Sarvarthasiddhi" concept.  The third point
of discussion is the "Sadvyalaksanam" (characteristics of the true) sutra. The
Svetambara tradition does not accept this sutra.  The fourth point concerns the
transformation of "Pudgalas" (matter) after they are bound to the soul. The
Svetambara tradition prefers the term "Sama" (equal) in this context.  Both
Digambara and Svetambara traditions generally agree that "karma" (action) with a
higher quality binds to the soul with a lower quality. However, the Svetambara
tradition deviates from this principle in the interpretation and structure of
the sutras.  The fifth point discusses the "Kala" (time) dravya (substance). The
Svetambara tradition disagrees with the existence of "Kala" as a dravya, instead
using the term "Addhasamaya" (half-time) and considering it as a "Paryaya"
(state) dravya.  The sixth point deals with the "Parinam" (transformation) of
the soul. The Digambara tradition accepts only the sutra "Tadbhavah Parinam"
(transformation is the same as the cause), while the Svetambara tradition
accepts three additional sutras.  The sixth chapter has ten points of
difference. The first point is the second sutra, which the Digambara tradition
considers as one sutra, while the Svetambara tradition considers it as two.  The
second point is the sutra "Indriyakapayaavrata Kriyaah" (actions of the senses,
organs, vows, and conduct). The Digambara tradition accepts this sutra as it is,
while the Svetambara tradition prefers the text "Avratakashayeindriykriyaah"
(actions of the senses, organs, non-vows, and passions).  The third point is the
sutra concerning the "Asrava" (influx) of the "Sataavedaniya" (hundred-fold
suffering). The Digambara tradition accepts the text "Bhootvratyanukampa
Daanasaragasanayamaadi Yogaah" (the practice of compassion, charity, non-
attachment, and restraint), while the Svetambara tradition prefers
"Bhootvratyanukampa Daanam Saragasanayamaadi Yogaah" (compassion, charity,
attachment, and restraint).  The fourth point is the sutra concerning the
"Asrava" of "Charitramoha" (attachment to conduct). The Svetambara tradition
prefers the term "Atma" (soul) after the term "Teertha" (intense).  The fifth
point is the sutra concerning the "Asrava" of "Narakaayu" (hellish life). The
Svetambara tradition prefers the term "Cha" (and) in the middle of the sutra.
The sixth point is the sutra concerning the "Asrava" of "Manushyaayu" (human
life). The Digambara tradition considers these as two sutras, while the
Svetambara tradition considers them as one. Additionally, the Svetambara
tradition prefers the text "Swabhavamardavarjanam" (abandonment of natural
gentleness) instead of "Swabhavamardavam" (natural gentleness).  The seventh
point is the sutra concerning the "Asrava" of "Devaayu" (divine life). The
Digambara tradition considers the sutra "Samyaktva Cha" (right faith and) as a
separate entity, while the Svetambara tradition hesitates to accept it as a
sutra.  The eighth point is the sutra concerning the "Asrava" of "Shubha Nama"
(auspicious name). The Digambara tradition prefers the term "Tat" (that).  The
ninth point is the sutra concerning the "Asrava" of "Teerthankara Prakruti"
(nature of the Tirthankara). The Svetambara tradition prefers the text "Sangha
Sadhusamadhih" (concentration on the community of the righteous) instead of
"Sadhusamadhih" (concentration on the righteous).  The tenth point is the sutra
concerning the "Asrava" of "Uchchagotra" (high lineage). The Svetambara
tradition prefers the text "Tadviparayo" (opposite of that) instead of
"Tadviparayo" (opposite of that).  The seventh chapter has six points of
difference. The first point is the five sutras concerning the five "Vratas"
(vows) and their five "Bhavanaas" (feelings). The Digambara tradition accepts
these as sutras, while the Svetambara tradition does not.  The second point is
the sutra "Hisadishvihaamutra" (here and hereafter). The Svetambara tradition
prefers the term "Cha" (and) after the term "Amutra" (hereafter).  The third
point is the sutra "Maitri" (friendship) and others. The Digambara tradition
prefers the term "Cha" (and) in the middle of the sutra.  The fourth point is
the sutra "Jagatkaaya" (world body) and others. The Digambara tradition prefers
the term "Va" (or), while the Svetambara tradition prefers "Cha" (and).  The
fifth point is the sutra concerning the seven "Sheelas" (virtues). The Digambara
tradition prefers the text "Proshadhopavas" (fasting on medicine), while the
Svetambara tradition prefers "Praushadhopavas" (fasting on medicine).  The sixth
point is the sutra concerning the five "Atichaaras" (excesses) of the "Ahimsa"
(non-violence) vow. The Svetambara tradition prefers the text "Savicched" (with
separation) instead of "Chhed" (separation).  The eighth chapter has six points
of difference. The first point is the second sutra. The Svetambara tradition
considers it as two sutras.  The second point is the sutra concerning the five
"Bhedas" (divisions) of "Jnanavarana" (veil of knowledge). The Digambara
tradition...

## Introduction  This text discusses differences in the texts of the Digambara
and Svetambara traditions of Jainism. It focuses on the differences in the names
of the five types of knowledge, the five types of sleep, the five types of
distractions, the six types of virtues and vices, the ten types of Dharma, the
five types of conduct, and the three types of meditation.  The text also
mentions that there are many other minor differences in the texts of the two
traditions, but these are not discussed in detail.  ## Differences in Textual
Interpretations  The text highlights that the differences in the texts of the
two traditions are based on the interpretations of the *Satartha Siddhi* and
*Tattvartha Bhashya*. The *Satartha Siddhi* is a commentary on the *Tattvartha
Sutra*, a foundational text in Jainism. The *Tattvartha Bhashya* is another
commentary on the *Tattvartha Sutra*.  The text notes that the Digambara
commentators generally follow the interpretation of the *Satartha Siddhi*, while
the Svetambara commentators follow the interpretation of the *Tattvartha
Bhashya*. However, there are significant differences in the interpretations of
the *Tattvartha Bhashya* itself, as evidenced by the commentaries of Haribhadra
Suri and Siddhasena Divakara.  The text uses the example of the
*Nityavasthanitanyaruparani* sutra from the fifth chapter of the *Tattvartha
Sutra* to illustrate the differences in interpretations. Siddhasena Divakara, in
his commentary on this sutra, mentions several different interpretations.  This
text provides a glimpse into the complex history of textual interpretation in
Jainism and the differences that exist between the Digambara and Svetambara
traditions.

##  **Sarvarthasiddhi**  1. According to one commentator,
'Nityavasthanianyrupaani' is not one sutra but two. The first is
'Nityavasthanitani' and the second is 'Arupaani'. 'Arupaani' is considered a
separate sutra to prove that the four substances, Dharma etc., are formless. 2.
According to another commentator, 'Nityavaspitarupaani' is the sutra. According
to this, there is no need to give a separate case ending at the end of the word
'Nityavasthanit-'. All three words should be compounded. 3. The third opinion is
that the sutra is 'Nityavasthanianyrupaani'. But in this, the word 'nitya' is
not independent but an adjective of the word 'avasthita'. According to this
opinion, the first word will be 'nityam avasthanitani nityavasthanitani'. 1.
Apart from these, two other opinions have been mentioned there. But they are
only differences of opinion regarding the meaning, so we have not discussed them
separately here. _ Later on, these differences of opinion increased even
further. As evidence, we present here some of the textual variations of the
Tattvarthasutra commentary, which were introduced by Shriman Pandit Jugul
Kishorji Mukhtar in Anekanta Varsh Tri Kiran Ek. This commentary was sent to
Panditji by Shriman Pandit Nathuramji Premi. By examining this commentary, it is
clear that it is the work of a Svetambara Acharya, because it addresses the
Digambara Acharyas with words like 'jad', 'duratma' and 'sutravachanachour'.
Therefore, the textual variations or additional sutras found in this commentary
are quite significant. The additional sutras found in the commentary are:
Taijasam api 50, Dharma vansa shaillanjani arista madhavya madhaviti cha 2,
Uchavasaaharvedanoppaatanubhavatasch sadhya: 23, Sa dvividhah 42, Samyaktvam cha
21, Dharmaastikaayaabhavat. The Tattvarthabhashyakar does not accept these as
sutras. Similarly, the main commentators of the Tattvarthabhashya,
Haribhadrasuri and Siddhasenagani, also do not consider these as sutras.
Nevertheless, the commentator has considered them as sutras. Even if we forget
for a while the debate about whether they are sutras or not, the sutra
'Samyaktvam cha' found among them cannot be forgotten under any circumstances.
It is not mentioned in the Tattvarthabhashya, nor have other Svetambara Acharyas
mentioned it. Yet, the commentator considers it a sutra based on some old
source. Not only that, he considers it to be the work of the original sutrakar.
This was the discussion about the differences in the sutras. Now look at one of
its textual variations. According to the Digambara tradition, the sutra that
describes the seven kshetras in the third chapter does not have the word 'tatra'
at the beginning, but the Tattvarthabhashya-accepted version of the said sutra
has the word 'tatra' at the beginning. Nevertheless, the commentator here does
not accept the Tattvarthabhashya-accepted text but accepts the Digambara
tradition-accepted text. The point to be noted here is that when the
Tattvarthasutra and the Tattvarthabhashya were the work of the same person and
the Svetambara Acharyas were well aware of this fact, why was there so much
difference of opinion regarding the text of the sutras, especially when the
Tattvarthabhashya confirms the text accepted by it? We conclude, seeing all this
difference of opinion, that before the Tattvarthabhashya-accepted text of the
sutras was accepted, there were many attempts, big and small, to establish the
Svetambara tradition-accepted text of the sutras, and those attempts continued
to be accepted even later. This is why, even after Uma Swami wrote the
Tattvarthabhashya and established the text of the sutras, it did not receive the
same acceptance that the Sarvarthasiddhi and the text of the sutras accepted by
it received in the Digambara tradition. 2. Sarvarthasiddhi 1. The significance
of the name - In the available literature, Sarvarthasiddhi is the first
commentary written on the Tattvarthasutra.

## Introduction 27 At the end of each chapter, Acharya Pujyapada himself has
given a concluding verse. In it, he has mentioned its name as Sarvarthasiddhi
and accepted it as a commentary. In praise of it, he writes at the end of the
commentary...  "Those who desire the happiness of heaven and liberation, let
them constantly hold in their minds this Tattvartha-vritti, known as
Sarvarthasiddhi, which is the essence of the excellent nectar of the Jainendra
Shastra, and which has been established by virtuous men."  He further writes:
"Those who know the essence of the truth, who listen to this Tattvartha-vritti
with devotion to Dharma, and who read it, have as if taken the nectar of the
supreme happiness of Siddhi in their hands. What is there to be said about the
happiness of the Chakravartis and the Indras?"  The purpose of giving it the
name 'Sarvarthasiddhi' is that by contemplating it, one attains the fulfillment
of all kinds of meanings, or the fulfillment of the supreme happiness of
liberation, which is the best of all meanings. This statement is not an
exaggeration, because the doctrine of the Tattvartha-sutra, which is explained
in it, is the means of achieving the liberation, which is the primary goal of
all human endeavors.  The Indian tradition has given birth to many philosophies.
But at the root of all of them, the attainment of the goal of liberation has
been the primary objective. Maharshi Jaimini begins the Purva Mimamsa Darshan
with the sutra:  "Om, Athato Dharma-jijnasa ||1||"  And after that, he describes
the nature of Dharma and considers its means. The same is the case with Vyasa
Maharshi. He began the Sharirika Mimamsa Darshan with the sutra:  "Athato
Brahma-jijnasa ||1||"  Now look at the sutras of the Nyaya Darshan. Its founder,
Gautama Maharshi, writes that the knowledge of the true nature of Pramana,
Prameya, Sanshaya, Prayojana, Drishtaanta, Siddhanta, Avayava, Tarka, Nirnaya,
Vada, Jalapa, Vitanda, Hetvabhasa, Chala, Jati, and Nigraha-sthana leads to the
attainment of liberation. ||1|| The sutra is as follows:  "Pramana-prameya-
sanshaya-prayojana-drishtaanta-siddhanta-avayava-tarka-nirnaya-vada-jalpa-
vitanda-hetuabhasa-chala-jati-nigraha-sthanaanaam tattva-jnaanaat nishreyasa-
adhigaman ||1||"  The founder of the Vaisheshika Darshan, Maharshi Kanada, also
has this vision in front of him. He writes at the beginning:  "Athato Dharma-
vyakhyasyam ||1||"  The situation of Kapila Rishi is not much different. He also
considered the ultimate goal of human endeavor as the main one. He begins the
Sankhya Darshan with these words:  "Ath trividha-khaatyanta-nivattri-atyant-
purushartha ||1||"  The beginning of the Yoga Darshan is even more captivating.
Maharshi Patanjali says: "Now we will teach Yoga. ||1|| Yoga is the cessation of
the fluctuations of the mind. ||2|| When the fluctuations of the mind cease, the
seer abides in his own nature. ||3||" Look at his sutras on this subject:  "Ab
yoganushasanam ||1|| Yogashchittavrittinirudhah ||2|| Tava drashta
svrupe'vasthanam ||3||"  After all this, when our gaze falls on the Tattvartha-
sutra, the sutra text of Jain Darshan, we see the same truth there. Beginning
it, Acharya Gadadhar writes:  "1. Iti Sarvarthasiddhi-sanjnakayaam Tattvartha-
vattau prathama-adhyaayah samaaptah."

## Sarvarthasiddhi 'Samyagdarshanaman Charitranni Mokshamārgaḥ ||1||' This is
the essence of the formulation of Indian philosophies. Therefore, it is entirely
appropriate for Pujyapada Swami to say that those who read and listen to this
tattvārthavṛtti with devotion to Dharma, as if they have taken the nectar of
supreme bliss in their own hands. Then what to say about the pleasures of the
Chakravarti and Indra? This makes its name 'Sarvarthasiddhi' meaningful. 28 2.
Style of Composition - We have said that Sarvarthasiddhi is a vṛtti-grantha. The
vṛttikāra has also called it 'vṛtti'. In which, taking the support of the words
of the sūtra, the discussion of each word is done along with the word incident.
This is called vṛtti. This meaning of vṛtti is literally fulfilled in
Sarvarthasiddhi. There is hardly any word of the sūtra which is not explained in
it. For example, in the first chapter of the Tattvarthasutra, sūtra 2, why the
word 'tattvārtha' is used instead of just 'tattva' or 'artha', he has discussed
it with such clarity, pointing to other philosophies, that it gives a clear
glimpse of the vṛttikāra's style of composition. He proceeds by considering
every word of the sūtra in detail. Where there appears to be a contradiction
with the āgama, he protects the sūtra text as it is, and skillfully reconciles
it. This skill of his is even more evident in chapter 4, sūtra 19 and sūtra 22.
In sūtra 19, instead of saying 'navagraiveyakeṣu', it is said 'navasu graṁ
veyakeṣu'. It is not hidden from every āgamāmāsi that there are nine vimāna
called anudiśa besides the nine graiveyak. But the original sūtra does not
mention the nine anudiśa. Acharya Pujyapada does not hide this secret. He
understands the intention of the sūtrakara and explains the reason for not
keeping the word 'nava' intact, clearly stating that here the word 'nava' has
been directed separately to take the nine anudiśa. The same problem arises
before him during the explanation of the 22nd sūtra. Up to the second kalpa of
the āgama, up to the twelfth kalpa of the pītaleśyā, up to the padmaleśyā, and
further on, the śuklaleśyā is directed. According to this arrangement of the
āgama, it is very difficult to reconcile the said sūtra. But the courage with
which he protects both the āgama and the sūtra text on such an occasion, seeing
this, our head cannot remain bowed at his feet without reverence. Patanjali's
Mahābhāṣya is famous on Panini's grammar. In it, the discussion of a subject as
dry and difficult as grammar has been done in such a pleasant and simple way
that one does not want to leave it after taking it in hand. We will see later
how much the Sarvarthasiddhikāra used it while writing Sarvarthasiddhi. Here it
is only to be told that not only was it used extensively in it, but it was also
digested well and constructed in the same style, and surprisingly, it is a
grammar text and this is a philosophy text, yet there is no slackness in the
composition anywhere. The style of composition of Sarvarthasiddhi can be
compared to the flowing current of a flat river, which always moves forward in
one form with a steady and peaceful feeling, it does not know how to stop
anywhere. Acharya Pujyapada has not only paid attention to the beauty of
language in it, but has also fully fulfilled the āgamika tradition. The seventh
and eighth sūtras of the first chapter are a prime example of this. While
discussing the explanation of these sūtras, it becomes clear how deeply he had
studied the siddhānta granthas. From this, we dare to say with certainty that by
writing Sarvarthasiddhi, on the one hand he has increased the glory of Sanskrit
literature, on the other hand he has also earned the credit of protecting the
āgamika literature that has come down from tradition. In conclusion, regarding
the style of composition of Sarvarthasiddhi, it can be said briefly that it is
written in such a pleasant and subject-oriented style that later readers, from
Upāsyāti onwards, all the commentators, vārtikakāras and tīkakāras of the
Tattvarthasutra, have been compelled to follow it.

## Introduction  3. Textual variations and interpretations - While writing the
Sarvarthasiddhi, Acharya Pujyapada did not mention any other commentary or text
on the Tattvarthasutra. However, it can be said from the Sarvarthasiddhi that he
must have had one or two small sutra texts or commentaries in front of him while
writing it, and there were also one or two important textual variations in them.
Acharya Pujyapada has discussed such textual variations in two places. The first
place is the 16th sutra of the first chapter and the second place is the 53rd
sutra of the second chapter.  1. The 16th sutra of the first chapter is as
follows:  > Bahubahuvividhani Tanuktan Vaṇān > Tarāṇām || 16 ||  In this, the
text is "Anihsut" after "Kshipre", but Acharya Pujyapada points out that
"Apareshām Kshinishrit iti pāṭhaḥ." That is, according to other Acharyas, the
text is "Nishrit" in place of "Anihsut" after "Kshike".  29  Currently, none of
the commentaries and sutra texts of the Tattvarthasutra available to us, whether
Digambara or Svetambara, have this second text. Therefore, it cannot be said
that Acharya Pujyapada mentioned this difference of opinion based on any one
commentary or sutra text. The commentator of the Tattvarthabhasya, Vacaka
Umasvati, has definitely not accepted the word "Anihsut" in the Sarvarthasiddhi,
and instead accepted the text "Anishrit". Therefore, there is no doubt that
Acharya Pujyapada had the Tattvarthabhasya or the Tattvarthabhasya-approved
sutra text in front of him, and he pointed to it through this textual variation.
It seems likely that among the commentaries and annotations that were available
to him while writing the Sarvarthasiddhi commentary, some of them may have had
this second text, and Acharya Pujyapada mentioned this textual variation from
that source. Not only that, but it would also have been reconciled in some
commentary. This is why Acharya Pujyapada did not just mention the textual
variation, but also mentioned how other Acharyas interpret this text if it is
accepted, using the phrase "Te evam varṇayanti" etc.  2. The 53rd sutra of the
second chapter is as follows:  > "Aupapādikacaramosmāyeha sāṁkhyeya
varṣāyuṣo'naptyuḥ || 53 ||"  This has the text "Charamolamadeha". This creates
the confusion of whether all Charmasariri are those with the best body, or if
some are, then what is the need to give the word "Uttama"? And if some are those
with the best body, then should it be considered that only those Charmasariri
who have the best body have infinite lifespan, and not other Charmasariri? It is
very likely that someone may have accepted the text "Charmadeha" to avoid this
flaw. Whatever it may be, both texts were in front of Acharya Pujyapada, and he
accepted the text "Charamotamadeha" as the sutrakar's, and mentioned the text
"Charmadeha" as a textual variation.  The sutra text approved by the
Tattvarthabhasya that is available today has the text "Charamveholam puruṣa".
Some scholars doubt that Acharya Pujyapada may have had the Tattvarthabhasya in
front of him, and based on that, he mentioned this textual variation in the
Sarvarthasiddhi. However, we do not see any factual basis in their statement.
Because, firstly, the Tattvarthabhasya does not have the text "Charmadeha". It
definitely has the text "Charamvehotam puruṣa", but the situation regarding this
text is also unclear. Acharya Siddhasena has raised this issue in his commentary
on the Tattvarthabhasya, and finally said that we cannot say what the actual
situation is in this regard.

## Sarvarthasiddhi  If another Acharya, like Pujyapada, had encountered the
reading "charamveha" in the Tattvarthabhaṣya, they would have mentioned
"charamdehottampurusa iti va pāṭhaḥ" instead of "charamveha iti va pāṭhaḥ." This
is because they had to decide which reading, "charamdehottampurusa" or another,
was available in place of "charamdeha." In such a situation, they would not
mention an incomplete alternative reading, even by mistake.  It is clear that
this alternative reading, like "kṣipranisaṭ," must have been available to
Acharya Pujyapada in other commentary texts. It is on this basis that he
mentions it here.  3. We have already given an example of arthantrannyasa in the
context of the style of composition, while discussing Chapter 4, Sutra 22.
There, we have indicated that Acharya Pujyapada has beautifully maintained both
the sutra and the agam, as the complete agamic meaning did not fit in the sutra.
This is the first example of arthantrannyasa.  4. As a second example, we
present the 11th sutra of the 9th chapter. It mentions the 11 parisahas of
vedaniya nimittaka. To clarify this topic further, we would like to discuss it
in detail.  The parisahas are considered from the sixth gunasthana, as the
beginning of the sramanyapada occurs here. Therefore, it is correct to say that
all parisahas exist in this gunasthana, because there is a presence of pramada
in this gunasthana. In the presence of pramada, both the actions of generating
the kṣudhādijanaya vikalpa and the effort to divert the cittavṛtti from it
towards dharmyadhyana to overcome it become necessary. And the situation of the
seventh gunasthana, although free from pramada, is not different from this,
because the difference between these two gunasthanas is only in the presence or
absence of pramada. Although the sixth gunasthana is named after the vikalpa and
its corresponding pravṛtti, and the seventh gunasthana is named after its
suppression, the flow of these two gunasthanas is so much up and down that the
parisahas and their actions like jaya cannot be properly divided, and these
actions have to be considered as belonging to both. The udirana of vedaniya
occurs up to the sixth gunasthana, not beyond. Therefore, it can be said that
the kṣudhādijanaya vedanakarya that occurs in the sixth gunasthana due to the
nimitta of vedaniya is not possible in any way beyond that. Upon reflection,
this seems to be the case, and it is indeed so, because in the gunasthanas of
apramattasamyata etc., the jiva has neither external pravṛtti nor results in
accordance with external pravṛtti. Also, the kṣayās arise in an unmanifest form,
without buddhi, then how far is it appropriate to consider the presence of
kṣudhādi parisahas? This is a matter for consideration. Therefore, it is
necessary to see here from what perspective the presence of these parisahas is
considered in the later gunasthanas.  Any object is considered from two
perspectives: one from the perspective of its function, and the other...  1.
Although the commentator Umasvati has explained each term of the "aupapatika"
sutra, and has independently explained the term "uttampurusa," and later, in the
conclusion, he has declared all except the term "uttampurusa" as having an
"anpavartya āyu," it can be concluded from this that the term "charamdeha"
alone, similar to the term "charamdehottampurusa," was also acceptable to him.
But here, it is necessary to see on what basis the commentator Umasvati, being
the sutrakar himself, has accepted these two readings in the bhasya. When he was
certain that uttampurusa also have anpavartya āyu, then while concluding, he
should have included them along with the others. But he did not do so. This
clearly shows that the commentator Umasvati must have also encountered two
readings, and he must have considered it appropriate to explain both in
sequence. On this basis, he cannot be the sutrakar in any way.

## From a causal perspective:  **31**  The scriptures have extensively discussed
the nature and causes of the *parivāha* and their *jaya*. The meaning of
*parivāha* and their *jaya* is to restrain one's mind from going towards them
when they arise due to obstacles and to remain engaged in essential activities
like self-study, meditation, etc. Considering this nature of *parivāha* and
their *jaya*, it becomes clear that the *pramatta-samyata* *guṇasthāna* is the
only one where the mind goes towards them when they arise due to obstacles, and
the being strives to restrain the mind from these *parivāha*. However, the
situation in the higher *guṇasthānas* is different. There, even in the presence
of external causes, the mind does not even slightly enter them. Not only that,
but further on, a situation arises where neither external causes are present nor
the mind remains. Therefore, in these *guṇasthānas*, the *parivāha* are only
instructed by considering the internal causes.  Causes are also of two types:
external causes and internal causes. There is no rule for the presence of
external causes. Some may be attainable, and some may not. But internal causes
are found in everyone. This is why the texts of both the Digambara and
Svetambara traditions, when considering the causes of *parivāha*, primarily
point to internal causes. This is why in the *Tattvārthasūtra*, these internal
causes are described as the *udaya* of *jñānāvaraṇa*, *vedanīya*, *darśana-
mohaniya*, *cāritra-mohaniya*, and *antarāya*, not in any other form.  There are
twenty-two *parivāha* in total. Among them, *prajñā* and *ajñāna* *parivāha*
occur in the *udaya* of *jñānāvaraṇa*. The *udaya* of *jñānāvaraṇa* occurs up to
the *kṣīṇa-moha* *guṇasthāna*, therefore, their *sadbhāva* is said to be up to
the *kṣīṇa-moha* *guṇasthāna*. However, this does not mean that the *vikalpa*
that can occur in a *pramatta-samyata* being due to *prajñā* and *ajñāna* also
occurs in the *aprammatta-samyata* and other *guṇasthānas*. Even though such
*vikalpa* does not occur in the higher *guṇasthānas*, the *udaya* of
*jñānāvaraṇa* is found there, therefore, their *sadbhāva* is said to be there.
*Adarśana-parivāha* occurs in the *udaya* of *darśana-mohaniya*, and *alābha-
parivāha* occurs in the *udaya* of *antarāya*. It is not hidden from any student
of karma-śāstra that the *udaya* of *darśana-mohaniya* occurs only up to the
*aprammatta-samyata* *guṇasthāna*, therefore, the *sadbhāva* of *adarśana-
parivāha* can be said to be up to this *guṇasthāna* at most. And the *udaya* of
*antarāya* occurs up to the *kṣīṇa-moha* *guṇasthāna*, therefore, the *sadbhāva*
of *alābha-parivāha* is said to be up to there. But in terms of function, both
these *parivāha* should be known to be up to the *pramatta-samyata* *guṇasthāna*
only. Their *sadbhāva* further on is said only in relation to the *udaya* of
*darśana-mohaniya* and the *udaya* of *antarāya*.  **Introduction**  It is also
desirable to consider here, in passing, what the *Tattvārthasūtra* author,
Ācārya Gṛddhpiṭṭha, meant by the term *bādarasāmprāya* when he states the
*sadbhāva* of all *parivāha* in a *bādarasāmprāya* being. We have already
written that the *udaya* of *darśana-mohaniya* occurs only up to the
*aprammatta-samyata* *guṇasthāna*, therefore, the *sadbhāva* of *adarśana-
parivāha* cannot be considered to be beyond the *aprammatta-samyata*
*guṇasthāna* in any way. In such a situation, the meaning of *bādarasāmprāya*
can only be a being with gross *kaṣāya*. This is why, in *Sarvārthasiddhi*,
while explaining this term, it is said that "This is not the acceptance of a
particular *guṇasthāna*. Then what is it? It is a meaningful instruction. It
accepts *pramatta* etc. *samyata*."  But in the *Tattvārthabhāṣya*, the sūtra
"Mādarasāmprāye sabai" is explained in these words: "Bāvarasāmyarāyasaṃyate
sarve dvāviṃśatir api parīṣhaḥ saṃbhavanti." That is, all twenty-two *parivāha*
are possible in a *bādarasāmprāya* *samyata*. The main commentator of the
*Tattvārthabhāṣya* is Siddhasena Gaṇi. He explains the above words of the
*Tattvārthabhāṣya* in these words:  1. Nevaṃ guṇasthāna viśeṣa grahaṇam. Kiṃ
tarhi? Arthanirdeśaḥ tena pramattādīnāṃ saṃyatādīnāṃ grahaṇam. Saṃ. [A. 9, Sū.

## Sarvarthasiddhi  "The one whose kṣaya is sthūla is called bādarasāmprāya-
samyata. Among them, some subdue the mohaniya, hence they are called upasamaka,
and some destroy it, hence they are called kṣapaka. In this, all twenty-two
kṣudhā etc. pariṣahas are possible."  This explanation clearly shows that the
commentator Umāsvāti, following the intention of Siddhasena Gaṇika, here uses
the term 'bādarasāmprāya' to refer to the ninth guṇasthāna. Prajñācaksu Paṇḍit
Sukhlālji has also accepted this meaning in his commentary on the
Tattvārthasūtra. He writes, "Where the bādar, i.e., special form of sāmprāya-
kṣaya, is possible, that is the ninth guṇasthāna called sāmprāya. There are
twenty-two pariṣahas in this ninth guṇasthāna. This is because all the karmas
that are the cause of pariṣahas are present there."  These are two
interpretations of the term 'bādarasāmprāya', found in Sarvarthasiddhi and
Tattvārthabhāṣya respectively. According to the interpretation of
Sarvarthasiddhi, the term 'bādarasāmprāya' is not indicative of a specific
guṇasthāna, but rather a semantic reference, which makes sense in the context of
the emergence of adarśana pariṣaha in the emergence of darśanamohaniya. However,
accepting the interpretation of Tattvārthabhāṣya creates a new obstacle. The
existence of darśanamohaniya persists until the upasāntamoha guṇasthāna, so it
can be said that they might have referred to the adarśana pariṣaha until the
ninth guṇasthāna called bādarasāmprāya, in relation to the existence of
darśanamohaniya. But accepting this view raises two new objections. Firstly, if
they have accepted the existence of adarśana pariṣaha in relation to the
existence of darśanamohaniya, then its existence should be stated until the
eleventh guṇasthāna. Secondly, while explaining the sūtra "kṣutpipāsā-śītoṣṇa",
he says, "These pariṣahas arise from the emergence of all five karma-prakṛtis."
This means that these pariṣahas are produced by the emergence of five karma-
prakṛtis. Accepting the aforementioned meaning does not seem to be consistent
with this statement. Because, on the one hand, accepting the existence of
adarśana pariṣaha until the ninth guṇasthāna in relation to the existence of
darśanamohaniya, and on the other hand, stating that all pariṣahas are the
result of the emergence of five karmas, these two contradictory statements are
questionable. It is clear that according to the commentary of Siddhasena Gaṇika,
the statement of Tattvārthabhāṣya is not only erroneous, but also contrary to
the intention of the original sūtrakāra, because the original sūtrakāra has
accepted the existence of these pariṣahas primarily due to the emergence of
karmas. Otherwise, he would have definitely mentioned the existence of adarśana
pariṣaha and the existence of nāranya etc. pariṣahas due to the cause of
cāritramoha, until the eleventh guṇasthāna called upasāntamoha.  Nāgnya, arati,
strī, niṣadyā, ākrośa, yācanā, and satkāra-puraskāra, these seven pariṣahas
occur in the emergence of cāritramohaniya. Generally, although the emergence of
cāritramohaniya occurs until the tenth guṇasthāna called sūkṣma sāmprāyika, it
can be doubted that the existence of these seven pariṣahas should be stated
until the tenth guṇasthāna. However, there are two reasons for not stating their
existence until the tenth guṇasthāna. Firstly, the emergence of the sub-
categories of cāritramohaniya, namely krodha, māna, and māyā, and the kṣayās of
ni and nokṣaya, occurs only until a certain part of the ninth guṇasthāna, hence
the existence of these pariṣahas is stated until the ninth guṇasthāna. Secondly,
although the emergence of cāritramohaniya occurs in the tenth guṇasthāna, only
the emergence of one kṣaya, namely lobha, occurs, and that too is very subtle,
hence their existence is stated only until the ninth guṇasthāna, not until the
tenth guṇasthāna.  And kṣudhā, pipāsā, śīta, uṣṇa, daṃśamaśaka, caryā, śayyā,
vadha, roga, taṇasparśa, and mala, these eleven...

**Introduction**  33 Pariṣahs arise from Vedaniya Karma. Since Vedaniya Karma
arises in those who have it, therefore, their harmony is said to be up to that
point.  Thus, in the Gunasthānas of Apramatta-samyata, etc., the Sūtra-kāra has
spoken of the harmony of Pariṣahs, keeping in mind the cause. And for this
reason, Ācārya Pūjyapāda, in the Sarvārthasiddhi-kāra, has first explained this
Sūtra from the viewpoint of the Sūtra-kāra. Later, when he saw that some other
scholars, like ordinary humans, were misinterpreting the mention of Pariṣahs,
which are caused by the Kevali, and were only presenting the obstacles of
hunger, thirst, etc., he used the word "na samshi" to explain that there are not
eleven Pariṣahs in the form of the Kevali's actions. He has derived a different
meaning from that Sūtra. In this, there is neither his sectarian view nor has he
twisted the meaning. The sectarian view is of those who see it from that
perspective. There have been and are differences of opinion among the Ācāryas,
but it is a matter of understanding and experiencing how far it is appropriate
to put the garland of sectarian view on all differences of opinion. If Ācārya
Pūjyapāda had been of a sectarian viewpoint, he could have made a complete
change in the Sūtra instead of making such an effort. But he has kept his
position absolutely clear. If we look at it from the point of view of the truth,
this is the only example that can be the touchstone of his literary
authenticity. This is the second example of Artha-antaranyāsa. Apart from this,
one or two more examples of Artha-antaranyāsa can be presented, but since there
is no special purpose, we have not mentioned them here.  Thus, from these four
examples, it is easily understood how much Ācārya Pūjyapāda has taken care of
the protection of the original Sūtra-pāṭha and the variant readings.  **4.
Sarvārthasiddhi and Tattvārtha-bhāṣya**  Even so, Ācārya Pūjyapāda is accused of
having improved and expanded the available Sūtra-pāṭha and created the
Sarvārthasiddhi. We will see later what period the Sarvārthasiddhi belongs to
and what period the Tattvārtha-bhāṣya belongs to. There, we will only have to
consider the inner nature of these two from a comparative perspective.  **1.
Sūtra-pāṭha**  First, we take the Sūtra-pāṭha. There are enough minor
differences in the Sūtra-pāṭha accepted by the Sarvārthasiddhi and the Sūtra-
pāṭha accepted by the Tattvārtha-bhāṣya, due to changes in words or additions
and deletions of Sūtras, but we do not have to speculate about all of them here.
There are three Sūtras in which there is a fundamental difference. First, the
Sūtra that states the number of heavens, second, the Sūtra that states the
investigation in Sanatkumāra, etc., and third, the Sūtra that states that time
is not an independent substance.  The fundamental difference in the Sūtra that
states the heavens is that the Sūtra-pāṭha accepted by the Sarvārthasiddhi
enumerates 16 Kalpas, while the Sūtra-pāṭha accepted by the Tattvārtha-bhāṣya
enumerates 12 Kalpas. The objection to this is that when the Sūtra-pāṭha
accepted by the Sarvārthasiddhi mentions twelve distinctions of Kalpa-upanna
Devas and sixteen are enumerated while counting the names, then it becomes a
sufficient basis to believe that either Ācārya Pūjyapāda or some other Ācārya
before him has added or subtracted from this Sūtra and given it its present
form, while the situation of the Sūtra-pāṭha accepted by the Tattvārtha-bhāṣya
is completely different from this. Therefore, it is very likely that the Sūtra-
pāṭha accepted by the Tattvārtha-bhāṣya is the original and that the Sūtra-pāṭha
accepted by the Sarvārthasiddhi was created later by improving it."  **1. See P.
Sukhlalji's Introduction to Tattvārtha-sūtra, pp. 84, 85 2. See the two Sūtra-
pāṭha sections, Appendix and its commentary 3. See A. 3 S. 2 1 4. For these
objections, see P. Sukhlalji's Introduction to Tattvārtha-sūtra, pp. 73-89**

## Sarvarthasiddhi  Here, first of all, we need to consider whether it can be
concluded from the said sutra that the sutra text accepted by the
Tattvarthabhasya is the original and the sutra text accepted by the
Sarvarthasiddhi was created by improving or expanding it. It is clear that there
has been a change in one of the texts, but it is worth considering which text
the change is possible in. As we see, according to the Digambara tradition, the
types of Kalpopapann Dev are always counted as twelve and the Kalpas as sixteen.
Kalpa is a special name for the dwelling place of Kalpopapann Dev. If there are
twelve types of Kalpopapann Dev, but their dwelling places are considered to be
sixteen types, then what is the problem in this? And on this basis, how can it
be said that the sutra text accepted by the Sarvarthasiddhi has been improved?
If it was desirable to improve it, then in chapter 4, sutra 3, 'twelve' could
have been replaced with 'sixteen'. On the contrary, it can only be said that
Pujyapada Swami protected the text he received as it was. On the other hand,
when we pay attention to the text accepted by the Tattvarthabhasya, even then it
does not seem possible to reach any conclusion based on this sutra. Because
there also, in this sutra, there is no such strong reason for reduction or
increase that it can be said that the said sutra has been changed. The acharyas
of both traditions are firm in their own tradition's beliefs, so on this basis,
it can only be said that it is possible to improve the sutras by the one who
composed them in later times. Secondly, there is a sutra that advocates
consideration in Sanatkumar etc. The position of this sutra in both is as
follows:  * **Sarva** : Seshaah Sparsarupashabdamanahpraveechaaraah. *
**Tattvabhasya** : Seshaah Sparsarupashabdamanahpraveechaaraah dwayordwayoh.  We
see that according to the Tattvarthabhasya, this sutra has the extra word
'dwayordwayoh', while it is completely absent in the Sarvarthasiddhi. Before
this, in both traditions, the sutra 'Kayapraveechaaraah Aa Aishanaat' comes.
This establishes the provision of praveechaar till the Saudharma and Aishana
Kalpas. Further, according to the Sarvarthasiddhi, fourteen and according to the
Tattvarthabhasya, ten Kalpas remain, in which this sutra establishes the
provision of praveechaar. In the present case, it is to be seen how the
consistency of this is established in both the Sarvarthasiddhi and the
Tattvarthabhasya. It is clear that in the Sarvarthasiddhi, due to the absence of
the word 'dwayordwayoh', Acharya Pujyapada did not face any difficulty in
explaining it. He explained it according to the Aarsh and got rid of it. But the
situation of the Tattvarthabhasyakar is completely different. Due to the word
'dwayordwayoh' in front of him, while explaining it, there was a problem that
how to establish the consistency of this, as there are four subjects of
praveechaar and ten Kalpas. As a result, he was forced to consider the last four
Kalpas as two to explain this sutra. He tried to explain it somehow, but the
inconsistency that arises from this cannot be removed in any way. This shows
that he himself, relying on the Tattvarthabhasya, with the intention of
clarifying this sutra, added this word to the sutra. Here, the possibility of
the latter alternative is more.  We have found one or two more places where the
consistency of the sutras has been established relying on the Tattvarthabhasya.
For example, take the word 'Yathoktanimittaah'. This comes in the 22nd sutra of
the first chapter. Before this, they have said the sutra 'Dvividho'vadhih' with
the difference of one sutra, and they have explained these differences through
this sutra. In the present case, the word 'Yathokt' in the word
'Yathoktanimittaah' refers to this bhasya. They want to say through this word
that the remaining beings have six types of avadhi knowledge due to the nimitta
which we have referred to in the bhasya of the sutra 'Dvividho'vadhih'. But in
that situation, when the sutra composition has already been done and the bhasya
has been written later, the situation of the bhasyakar becomes doubtful. And it
has to be accepted that the Tattvarthabhasyakar, Vaachik Umaswati, has tried to
improve the ancient sutra text.  The third is the sutra that accepts the
existence of time. This is in both the Sarvarthasiddhi and the Tattvarthabhasya.

## Translation:  **Type Mentioned**  **Introduction**  **Time**  **Kalach.
Sarva. ** **Kal Ivetyeke. T. Bha. **  This acknowledges time as a substance. But
the Tattvarthabhashyakar, while accepting time as a substance, does so based on
the opinions of other Acharyas, not his own. This is why he has mentioned only
five Astikayas wherever he has mentioned substances in the Tattvarthamadhyama,
and has described the world as being made up of five Astikayas. The Shvetambar
Agam literature mentions six substances, and in one place, the
Tattvarthabhashyakar also mentions six substances, but this does not mean that
he considers time as a form. The reason is that wherever the Shvetambar Agam
literature mentions six substances, the word 'Addhasamay' is used for time
substance, not the word 'Kal', and the meaning of the word 'Addhasamay' here is
taken as a synonym, not a spatial substance. The Tattvarthabhashyakar has also
followed this practice. In the Tattvarth Sutra, where the word 'Kal' appears, he
has used the word 'Kal' while explaining it, but in the Sutras where the word
'Kal' does not appear, and where he considered it necessary to mention 'Kal', he
has used the word 'Addhasamay' instead of 'Kal'.  These two situations of the
Tattvarthabhashya and the accepted Sutra text help us to conclude that
initially, a Sutra like 'Kalich' would have been created, but later it would
have changed to 'Kamaschetyeke'.  **2. Style**  Here, two words need to be said
about the style of Sutra creation in context. Looking at the Sarvarth Siddhi
accepted Sutra text, it can be said that nothing is said in it by the principle
of 'Pariseshannyaya'. It simply moves forward by explaining the Sutras and their
terms. On the other hand, when we look at the Tattvarthabhashya, we do not see a
definite style. Sometimes they accept 'Pariseshannyaya' and sometimes they
don't. For example, the two Sutras 'Seshanam Samurchhanam' and 'Ashubhah
Papasya' should not have been said by the principle of 'Pariseshannyaya', yet he
has considered them as independent Sutras and left out 'Seshastrivedah' and
'Atonyatpaapam'. In such a situation, it does not seem reasonable to say that
Acharya Pujyapada gave these the form of independent Sutras after seeing the
Tattvarthabhashya. In fact, the Tattvarthabhashyakar has not been able to put
himself in such a position that a definite line can be drawn about him. Take the
example of the body section of another chapter. In it, both types of the origin
of the Vaikriyika body are shown in the Sutras, but when the topic of the Tejas
body came, he did not consider it necessary to show the type of its origin in
the Sutra. Can it be said, looking at this section, that this inconsistency
would have been pleasing to the original Sutrakar? Such inconsistencies are also
seen in other Sutras of the Tattvarthabhashya. In the fourth chapter, the Sutra

Sarvarthasiddhi  It becomes clear. However, it seems necessary to shed light on
some highly useful topics; because in the end, we have to see what the sequence
of their composition is. To elucidate this chapter in particular, we will first
speculate on similar passages and then touch upon those passages that shed light
on their precedence; because first, we have to show that the position of these
two texts is such that one is written by keeping the other in front, and
finally, it is to be considered in which one the tendency of following is
accepted. First, take the first sutra of the first chapter itself. In
Sarvarthasiddhi, this sentence occurs:  "We will explain in detail the nature,
characteristics, and regulations of these (topics) from the beginning." This
very sentence is elucidated in Tattvartha Bhashya with some changes in words.
"We will explain in detail the characteristics and regulations of that (topic)
from the beginning." Further, this similarity is seen till the end. For example
- Sarvarthasiddhi "Tattvartha Bhashya and the Tattvartha to be described,
starting from jiva, etc. 1.2. The tattvas, starting from jiva, etc. will be
described."  121 The characteristic of manifestation of equanimity, detachment,
compassion, and faith. Thus, the first (characteristic) is the manifestation of
equanimity, detachment, compassion, and faith.  12. The characteristic of
Tattvartha-shraddha (right faith in the categories of existence) is samyag-
darshana (right perception). 1.21 It is said that Tattvartha-shraddha is samyag-
darshana. Tattvartha-shraddha is said to be samyag-darshana. Now, what is the
tattva? To this, Utsanika 1,41 says: "There, what is the tattva?" To this, it is
said: Utsanika.  1,41 That is, the jiva (living being) is of four kinds: nama-
jiva (nominal living being), sthapana-jiva (established living being), dravya-
jiva (substantial living being), and bhava-jiva (psychical living being).  151
He who is established in wood, books, paintings, arts, and deposits, is the
sthapana-jiva (established living being). 1,51 The one who is established as a
jiva is the sthapana-jiva. 151 What is the special feature here? It is due to
the specific speaker. What is the specific feature? Here, it is said that there
are three speakers: the omniscient Tirthankara, or the learned scholar.  The
specific speakers are indeed determined. That is, by the omniscient supreme
sages, the supreme auspicious, the unique absolute knowledge, the specific
meaning, and the scriptural establishment, the Tirthankara name-karma is
designated. Due to its direct perception and the elimination of flaws, it is
said by the excellent disciples that the supreme excellence of speech and
authority is possessed by him. That which is entered into the group of the
excellent disciples, endowed with the excellence of intellect, is the one
established in the limbs. The composition of scriptures by the Shruta-kevalins
(omniscient by scriptures) immediately after the Ganadhara is the characteristic
of the limb. However, the supreme refined scriptural authority is the measure,
due to its authority. The Acarya (teacher) is again the one who, for the benefit
of the disciples with limited strength and short lifespan due to the defect of
time, has briefly expounded what was taught by the Ganadhara for the grace of
the disciples with limited strength and short lifespan.  1,20. Here, we have
cited only a few examples to clarify this topic. Further, we need to touch upon
those passages that help to clarify the precedence of Sarvarthasiddhi and
Tattvartha Bhashya.  Pandit Sukhlalji Sanghavi, in his work "Prajnacaksu", has
considered the question of which of Sarvarthasiddhi and Tattvartha Bhashya was
written first, and has shed light on this topic through three sub-topics:
difference in style, development of meaning, and sectarian affiliation. Based on
these grounds, he has attempted to establish Tattvartha Bhashya as the earlier
work.  According to Pandit Sukhlalji, let us assume that the style of
Sarvarthasiddhi is more developed and more thoroughly studied compared to the
style of Tattvartha Bhashya. It is also assumed that there are clear signs of
semantic development in Sarvarthasiddhi from the perspective of grammar.
However, the attempt to declare Tattvartha Bhashya as the earlier work and
Sarvarthasiddhi as the later work based on these grounds does not appear to be
justified. Acharya Pujya

## Introduction  The "Jainendra Vyakaran" written on top of the "Padaka
Vyakaran" is famous. He had also written a treatise on Nyaya, which is known
from the mention in the Dhavala commentary. In such a situation, it is natural
for the "Sarvarthasiddhi" composed by him to have a detailed and clear
discussion of these subjects. But the situation of the reader Umasvati is
completely different. He was mainly an Agamic scholar. All his works that have
been available so far are in accordance with the Svetambara Agam tradition. The
reason is that he has not specifically speculated on grammar and philosophy in
the Tattvarthabhashya.  His third objection is of sectarianism. Panditji has
chosen four such topics presented in the Sarvarthasiddhi in which he finds the
smell of sectarianism. He writes that "Kalatattva", Kevalikavalaahar,
Achalakatva and Strimoksha, etc., were written after taking the form of intense
differences of opinion on these matters and after sectarian insistence on these
matters, while this element of sectarian attachment is not visible in the
Bhashya.  Before considering this subject in detail, it seems necessary to
consider why Panditji dares to write such a thing.  After Lord Mahavira attained
liberation, there were five Shrutakevalis, the last of whom was Bhadrabahu.
During his time, there was a twelve-year famine in North India. Due to this,
Bhadrabahu along with the Sangha went to the south. The Svetambara tradition
also mentions this famine and accepts the fact that the Sangha scattered near
the sea. At that time, Bhadrabahu's main disciple, Maury Chandragupta, also went
with him and, on reaching there, Bhadrabahu attained Samadhi due to his
declining age. But some Sadhus and Shravakas stayed in Patna at the special
request and, due to circumstances, they accepted clothes, which is considered to
be the origin of the Svetambara Sangha in the Jain tradition. When the twelve-
year famine ended, some Sadhus returned to Patna. According to the Svetambara
tradition, "Bhadrabahu was then in the Terai region of Nepal and was engaged in
special penance for twelve years. The Sangha called Bhadrabahu to Patna, but he
did not come, due to which he was threatened to be expelled from the Sangha and
somehow he was persuaded to teach the disciple community. Sthulabhadra received
Angajnan from him. Even if we accept this statement of the Svetambara sect as
true, then also the Svetambara sect accepting its tradition from Sthulabhadra
and the non-inclusion of Bhadrabahu in the Patna recitation are two things that
indicate a major explosion in the Jain Sangha at that time. It is clear that the
recitation at that time did not represent the entire Jain Sangha and the Ang
literature that was compiled and written later was done with the view of
establishing the clothed Sadhus in the Jain tradition. The Svetambara Ang
literature available at this time is a compilation from about a thousand years
after Lord Mahavira's liberation. It is a matter of thought that when the first
recitation took place during the time of Bhadrabahu, why was it not preserved by
writing it down at that time? The sequence of events shows that there must have
been intense differences of opinion within the Svetambara Sangha at that time
and one group would say that it is not desirable to change the Ang literature
even in the situation of Sanghabhed. It is very possible that if the Svetambara
Ang literature had been compiled and written down at that time, its present form
would have been different.  Although there are mentions in the Svetambara Ang
literature that support nudity, but 1. The matter of intense differences of
opinion within the Sachela group is also accepted by the wise Pandit Sukhlalji.
He writes... "After Mathura, there was a Shruta-Sanskar in Vallabhi, in which
the differences of opinion of the Sthavir or Sachela group also remained." See
Tattvarth Sutra Introduction p. 30.

## 38 **Sarvarthasiddhi**  These references cannot be considered as a test of
their authenticity. In fact, they have been accepted due to circumstances. It is
not that the wise Pandit Sukhlalji is unaware of this situation. Knowing this,
he is trying to ignore this situation for some reason and is trying to declare
that the statements supporting Achalaktava in the Svetambara Angasutra are
indicative of the complete representation of the tradition of Bhagwan Mahavira.
It is true that both Achalaktava and Sachalaktava have been given a place in the
Shraman tradition and it is also true that Achalaktava is considered Utsarg
Dharma and Sachalaktava is considered Apavad Dharma. We also find such
references in the literature of the Digambar tradition which confirms this fact.
But there, Achalaktava refers to Muni Dharma and Sachalaktava refers to
Grihastha Dharma or Shravak Dharma. Shravak Dharma is an exception to Muni
Dharma. Where a householder becomes a Muni by avoiding all kinds of violence,
falsehood, theft and non-Brahma, there it is also necessary for him to avoid all
kinds of possessions. In the Svetambara Angasutra and the miscellaneous
literature, accepting clothes and utensils has also been considered a means of
restraint, but the means of restraint can be that which is not necessary for the
comfort of the body but is accepted only for the avoidance of animal suffering.
But to say that clothes and utensils are accepted for the avoidance of animal
suffering seems exaggerated, because this work is not visible through these
means. Secondly, if we consider them as an essential part of the said work, then
it cannot be considered to make the law of nudity and Panipatratva. But we see
that in the Svetambara Agam, there is also a provision for Achalatva and
Panipatratva, therefore, clothes and utensils cannot be instruments of restraint
according to them. There is a discussion about Utsarg and Apavadling. It is said
that nudity and Panipatratva are Utsarg Ling, but there should also be an
exception to it and clothes and utensils are accepted as an exception. We
believe that every Utsarg has an exception and this system has also been
accepted by the Shraman tradition. That is why it directs these two distinctions
of Muni Dharma and Grihastha Dharma. Muni Dharma is Utsarg Ling and Grihastha
Dharma is its exception. Therefore, accepting clothes and utensils cannot be a
part of Muni-Achar. Even though there has been such a situation during the time
of famine that the saints who remained in North India at that time had to accept
clothes and utensils. Not only this, they also had to accept punishment due to
some reason. But considering them as a sign of a saint is against the Muni-Marg.
We have already told you that those who accept clothes etc. due to weakness are
Shravaks. Their results cannot be in accordance with Muni Dharma.  Despite this
situation, clothes, utensils etc. have been considered as parts of a saint in
the Svetambara Angasutra due to insistence and their two distinctions of Jinkalp
and Sthavirkalp have been made. Due to this, the wise Pandit Sukhlalji has also
been forced to support it. Otherwise, he would not only accept the facts that he
finds the smell of sectarianism in the direction of, but he would also help in
paving the way forward by avoiding a very big mistake that happened in the
Shraman tradition due to circumstances.  We have already indicated that Panditji
has chosen four such things from Sarvarthasiddhi, which he considers to be of a
sectarian category. In Sarvarthasiddhi, the law of time element has been made
decisively, while it is mentioned in Tattvarthabhashya as a special opinion.
Sarvarthasiddhi accepts nudity by prohibiting Kevalikavalaahar and female
liberation, while Tattvarthabhashya accepts nudity in the context of Parisha and
also makes a provision for clothes, utensils and female Tirthankar. This is the
situation of Sarvarthasiddhi and Tattvarthabhashya, due to which Panditji has
formed his opinion about Sarvarthasiddhi in this way and on this basis, he has
tried to prove Tattvarthabhashya as older than Sarvarthasiddhi. In this matter,
Panditji's opinion is that 1. The meaning of the writings of the wise Pandit

## Introduction 39 'The *Sarvarthasiddhi* was written only after communal bias
had increased, while the *Tattvarthabhashya* is completely devoid of such bias.'
We have already explained how the ascetics in the Jain tradition accepted
clothes and utensils under certain circumstances. We have also mentioned that
the *Shvetambara Angashruta* was composed after the 5th century. Therefore, it
is certain that the *Tattvarthabhashya* was written sometime after that,
because, in the words of the commentator himself (the *Tattvarthabhashyakar*),
the *Angashruta* that he relied upon as the basis for the composition of the
*Tattvarthabhashya* was completely accepted by the *Sthavira* sect. This
statement is supported by this meaning. Generally, this difference of opinion
began to manifest itself in an aggressive form only after the *Shvetambara
Angashruta* became established as a canonical text. Because, the inclusion of
topics like clothed liberation and female liberation in such an important
literature as the *Angashruta*, which is said to be part of the Jain tradition,
was an event that destroyed and corrupted the old tradition. During this period,
on the one hand, while the aforementioned matters were being ordained under the
influence of communal bias, on the other hand, it became imperative to refute
them from a theoretical perspective and to declare them as the cause of bondage
due to philosophical delusion. The *Sarvarthasiddhikar* has done this work, and
he has done it with firmness. In fact, the burden of protecting the theoretical
side was on him during that time, and he has fulfilled it beautifully. In such a
situation, we should consider the chronology of the *Sarvarthasiddhi* and the
*Tattvarthabhashya* based on other evidence. It is secondary to decide this
based on stylistic differences, semantic development, and communalism.
Therefore, let us decide this truth in the light of other evidence. At this
time, two main commentaries on the *Tattvarthabhashya* are available... the
first is the commentary by *Haribhadra*, and the second is the commentary by
*Siddhsenagani*. Although *Acharya Haribhadra* and *Siddhsenagani* were
contemporaries or slightly later, they came after *Bhattakalankadeva*. Not only
that, *Siddhsenagani* has also extensively used the works of
*Bhattakalankadeva*, which is evident from his commentary. However, *Prajnakshu*
Pandit *Sukhlalji*, while agreeing with this opinion, goes further. He writes on
page 96 of the introduction to the *Tattvarthsutra*: 'While describing the
commentary on the same sutra in some places, he specifies five or six different
opinions. This gives reason to assume that when *Siddhsen* composed the
*Vritti*, there must have been at least five commentaries written on the
*Tattvarthsutra* in front of him; which seem to be separate from the three
famous *Digambara* interpretations like *Sarvarthasiddhi* etc. Because, it is
very likely that the *Rajavartika* and the *Shloka-vartika* were composed before
the *Siddhseniya Vrittika*. Even if it was composed before them, there is at
least this much difference between their compositions that *Siddhsen* did not
have the opportunity to get acquainted with the *Rajavartika* and the *Shloka-
vartika*. Here, we must first criticize Panditji's statement and then see if
*Siddhsenagani's* commentary was written without relying on the *Rajavartika*.
Panditji has first assumed five or six independent commentaries written on the
*Tattvarthsutra* based on *Siddhsenagani's* commentary on chapter five, sutra
three. We accept this on this basis. However, how can it be concluded from this
that *Siddhsenagani* wrote his commentary without relying on the
*Tattvarthavatika*? This only reveals that there were many other commentaries in
front of him that presented many readings of the sutra
'Nityavasthananyaruparani'. This is a separate topic and should be discussed
separately. 1. *Prajnakshu* Pandit *Sukhlalji* states on page 95 of the
introduction to the *Tattvarthsutra* that the commentary by *Haribhadra* was
completed by three writers, and this opinion seems appropriate from looking at
the commentary.

It should be considered that when Siddhasena Ganika wrote his commentary on the
Tattvartha Sutra, did the Tattvarthavartika exist or not? This is the relevant
point to be considered.  There is no doubt that Siddhasena Ganika was a great
scholar. In his commentary, he has mentioned many variant readings, different
opinions, texts, Acharyas and proofs of the Tattvartha Sutra, which shed light
on many historical facts. In this context, he has not forgotten Bhatta Akalanka
Deva's Siddhivinischaya and Tattvarthavartika. While mentioning Siddhivinischaya
in the commentary on Chapter 1, Sutra 3, he writes:  "Thus, the relationship
between cause and effect is to be understood as the form of the result, which is
determined by the cause, as explained in the Siddhivinischaya, which is to be
applied by those who seek special meaning through the door of criticism."
Siddhivinischaya is one of the most influential philosophical works available in
the literature of Bhatta Akalanka Deva, and it also contains the section on the
examination of creation. This confirms that this reference is to the same
Siddhivinischaya. We have also done a comparative study of Siddhasena Ganika's
commentary with the Tattvarthavartika. From this, we have reached the conclusion
that the Tattvarthavartika must have been available to Siddhasena Ganika when he
wrote his famous commentary on the Tattvarthabhashya. For comparison, see:  "The
case ending arises due to the meaning. For example, "Pray to the high houses of
Devadatta." Devadatta is understood." - Tattvarthavartika, Chapter 1, Sutra 7
"The case ending arises due to the meaning, "Pray to the high houses of
Devadatta." - Si. D. Utpanika, commentary on verse 6  Similarly, other sentences
indicating similarity are available, which have been pointed out by Pandit
Paramananda Shastri in Anekanta Varsh 3, Kiran 11, in the context of
Sarvarthasiddhi and Rajanaitik Lekh. In addition to these sentences indicating
similarity, there are also some mentions in Siddhasena Ganika's commentary,
which provide special support for his position being established after the
Tattvarthavartika, such as:  In the Tattvarthavartika, while explaining the
causes of hell, this sentence comes:  "He who has many beginnings and
attachments, he is one who has many beginnings and attachments."  Siddhasena
Ganika expresses the same point with a difference of opinion in these words:
"Others say - He who has many beginnings and attachments, he is one who has many
beginnings and attachments."  The explanation of this verse is also available in
Sarvarthasiddhi. Therefore, it can be said that Siddhasena Ganika must have
expressed this difference of opinion with Sarvarthasiddhi in mind. However,
there is a fundamental difference between the above-mentioned analysis and the
analysis done for the verse in Sarvarthasiddhi. In Sarvarthasiddhi, this
analysis is available as follows:  "He who has many beginnings and attachments,
he is one who has many beginnings and attachments."  But Siddhasena Ganika's
commentary follows the Tattvarthavartika in this matter, not Sarvarthasiddhi.
Therefore, we are compelled to believe that Siddhasena Ganika is referring to
the Tattvarthavartika author by the word "others" here.  In Siddhasena Ganika's
commentary, there are other mentions of readings or differences of opinion that
point towards the Tattvarthavartika.  This makes it clear that Siddhasena Ganika
must have had the Tattvarthavartika in front of him when he wrote his commentary
on the Tattvarthabhashya.  1. For this, see the Utthanika of the first Sutra and
Chapter 6, Sutras 16, 17, 18, etc.

## Introduction  The time has come to determine the chronological order of the
*Tattvarthabhashya* and the *Tattvarthavartika*. To do this, we need to compare
the two works.  It is generally accepted by all wise men that the
*Tattvarthavartika* was written after the *Sarvarthasiddhi*. There is clear
evidence that the *Tattvarthabhashya* must have been composed before the
*Tattvarthavartika*. We need not look for evidence elsewhere, as the
*Tattvarthavartika* itself bears witness to this.  First, consider the
*Uttanika* of the *Tattvarthavartika*. There is a difference in the explanation
of the reason for the composition of the *Tattvarthsutra* in the
*Sarvarthasiddhi* and the *Tattvarthabhashya*. The *Sarvarthasiddhi* states that
a learned monk, sitting in an assembly of monks, asked the Acharya, "O Lord,
what is the benefit of the soul?" The Acharya replied, "Moksha." The monk then
asked, "What is the means of attaining it?" In response to this question, the
*Tattvarthsutra* was composed. However, the *Tattvarthabhashya* presents a
different account of the *Uttanika*. It states that in this world, it is rare to
find teachings on the benefit of the soul without the path of Moksha. Therefore,
the path of Moksha is taught.  Now, read the *Uttanika* of the
*Tattvarthavartika* in light of these two accounts. It will be evident that it
clearly refers to both the *Uttanika* of the *Sarvarthasiddhi* and the
*Tattvarthabhashya*. Moreover, the reference to the *Uttanika* of the
*Tattvarthabhashya* begins with the word "Apare." This clearly indicates that
the author of the *Tattvarthavartika* considered the *Uttanika* of the
*Sarvarthasiddhi* to be the one accepted by the Digambara tradition, and the
*Uttanika* of the *Tattvarthabhashya* to be another. This is the case with the
*Uttanika*.  Next, consider the *Sutra* text. The author of the
*Tattvarthabhashya* has accepted the reading "Pruthutara" in the first *Sutra*
of the third chapter. In the Svetambara Agama literature, the reading "Chhatai
Chhatta" is available to express this meaning. The author of the
*Tattvarthabhashya*, while explaining this word, has clarified it using the
phrase "Chhatratichhatrasansthita." This reading is not found in the *Sutra*
text accepted by the *Sarvarthasiddhi*. The author of the *Tattvarthavartika*
not only notices this but also criticizes it, attempting to show that the
reading "Pathutara" in the *Sutra* is inappropriate.  Generally, there are
significant changes in the *Sutra* text accepted by the *Tattvarthabhashya*
compared to the one accepted by the *Sarvarthasiddhi*. However, the author of
the *Tattvarthavartika* does not discuss all these *Sutra* texts. He mainly
opposes those *Sutra* texts of the *Tattvarthabhashya* that, if accepted, would
clearly contradict the Agama. In the fourth chapter, the *Sutra* "Sesha Sparsh"
etc. appears. According to the *Tattvarthabhashya*, the reading "Dvayordvayo" is
found at the end of this *Sutra*. Bhatta Akalankdeva's keen observation falls on
this reading, and he considers it unacceptable to accept this additional
reading, pointing out its contradiction with the *Aarsh*. Similarly, in the
fifth chapter, the *Sutra* "Bandhe Adhiko Parinamiko Cha" appears. However, in
the *Tattvarthabhashya*, its modified form is found as "Bandhe Samadhiko
Parinamiko."  It is clear that the word "Sama" in this *Sutra* does not align
with the arrangement of bondage as described in the Agama. This fact is not
hidden from the author of the *Tattvarthavartika*, and therefore, due to its
contradiction with the Agama, he explicitly declares its lack of authenticity.
The same is the case with the last three *Sutras* of the fifth chapter in the
*Tattvarthabhashya*. These *Sutras* are:  "Anaviravimamscha || 42 ||
Rupichvaaviman || 43 || Yogoupayogi Jiveshu || 44 ||"  These *Sutras*
distinguish between the beginningless and beginningful aspects of the *Parinam*
(transformation), and call the *Parinam* of the *Pudgala* and the *Jiva*
beginningful.  1. See *Tattvarthabhashya Uttanika* verse 31. 2.

**Sarvarthasiddhi** is. Also, in the commentary of the 42nd Sutra, Dharma,
Adharma, Akash and Jiva's parinaama are said to be anaadi. On this, in the
Tattvarthavartika, an objection is raised, saying...-'Atranye
Dharmaadharmakalaakashaeshv anaavi: parinaama: maavimaan jeevapudgaleshu vadanti
tavayuktam.' That is, other people say that parinaama in Dharma, Adharma, Kaal
and Akash is anaadi, and in Jiva and Pudgal they say it is saadi, but their
saying so is inappropriate. Similarly, from the Tattvarthavartika of Chapter 1
Sutra 15 and 21; Chapter 2 Sutra 7, 20 and 333; Chapter 4 Sutra 8; Chapter 5
Sutra 2-3, Chapter 6 Sutra 18 and Chapter 8 Sutra 6, it is also known that the
Tattvarthabhashya was definitely in front of Akalankdev. Although there is some
difference of opinion in this matter. Dr. Jagdishchandraji wrote an article in
this regard in Anekant Varsh 3 Kiran 4, in which he explained that the
Tattvarthabhashya of Umaswati was present in front of Akalankdev. But Pandit
Jugulkishoreji Mukhtar does not accept this opinion. Pandit Kailashchandraji
Shastri also has the same opinion. We believe that there is no clear evidence to
support the fact that the Sutra text accepted by the reader Umaswati in the
Tattvarthabhashya was present before the writing of the Tattvarthabhashya. The
difference of opinion regarding the Sutra text, which Acharya Pujyapad and
Siddhasenagani have discussed in their commentaries, is also not related to the
Tattvarthabhashya accepted Sutra text. In such a situation, it seems weak to us
to believe that the Tattvarthabhashya of the reader Umaswati was not in front of
Bhatta Akalankdev. By observing all the commentaries of Digambar and Shwetambar
written on the Tattvarth Sutra, we can only be sure that the great Acharya who
composed the Tattvarth Sutra did not write any commentary or Vritti text on the
Tattvarth Sutra. The various differences of opinion regarding the Sutra subject
that appear in the Tattvarth Sutra in later times are evidence of this. It is
clear that until the time of Acharya Pujyapad, these differences of opinion were
very few. But on the other hand, the acceptance of the original Sutra text by
the Digambar tradition through Sarvarthasiddhi led to a strong reaction and the
original Sutra text was abandoned. As a result, not only did the differences of
opinion regarding the nature of the Sutra text start increasing, but also the
feeling of establishing an independent Sutra text arose. Based on all these
events and facts, our opinion is that the reader Umaswati himself would have
given the final form to the Sutra text accepted by his Tattvarthabhashya, and so
that this difference of opinion regarding the text would not take an aggressive
form, he himself would have written his famous Tattvarthadhigamabhashya on it.
It is true that before the reader Umaswati, other Shwetambar Acharyas had cut
and trimmed the original Tattvarth Sutra, and the reader Umaswati inherited it.
If Pandit Jugulkishoreji Mukhtar proposes this opinion keeping this intention in
mind that the Sutra text accepted by the Tattvarthabhashya was also present
before the reader Umaswati, then this statement may be possible to some extent,
but it does not affect the opinion that the Tattvarthabhashya was present in
front of the Tattvarthavatikakar, because the Tattvarthavatik does not only
mention the differences of opinion regarding the Sutra text accepted by the
Tattvarthabhashya, but also mentions some opinions that are directly related to
the Tattvarthabhashya. Thus, even if we accept that the Tattvarthabhashya was
written before the Tattvarthavatik, in the light of these evidences, it becomes
a matter of consideration when it was written. We have many perspectives on
this. 1. See Anekant Varsh 3 Kiran 4, 11 and 121 2. See Pandit
Kailashchandraji's Tattvarth Sutra Preface page 9 etc. 3. See Sarvarth Siddhi A.
1 S. 16 and A. 2 S. 53 and Siddhasen's commentary A. 1 S. and A. 5 S. 3 etc. 4.

## Introduction  This section is meant for review. The topics of review are: 1.
References to other commentaries, 2. Sutra references, and 3. Development of
meaning.  1. **References to other commentaries:** According to the prevailing
tradition, it is generally believed that **Sarvarthasiddhi** is the first
commentary on the Digambara tradition's accepted Sutra text, and
**Tattvarthabhashya** is the first commentary on the Svetambara tradition's
accepted **Tattvarthasutra**. Some scholars even believe that
**Tattvarthabhashya** is the original work of the author of **Tattvarthasutra**.
Based on this, they conclude that Acharya Pujyapada revised the original Sutra
text and created the Sutra text accepted by **Sarvarthasiddhi**, which is
prevalent in the Digambara tradition today. However, the facts emerging from
these commentaries and other evidence make this subject worthy of much
consideration. We have already mentioned two readings of **Sarvarthasiddhi**. If
the second reading is accepted based on the Sutra text itself, then considering
the first reading, it becomes easy to assume that there must have been a smaller
commentary available to the author of **Sarvarthasiddhi**. Otherwise, while
clarifying the differences in readings, he would not have said, "Thus they
describe" etc.  In **Tattvarthavartika**, while describing the fourth Sutra of
the fifth chapter, the question is raised, "Only five substances are mentioned
in the **Vritti**, so the teaching of six substances does not occur." Further,
while resolving this, the author of **Tattvarthavartika** says, "You did not
understand the intention of the **Vrittikara**. He has mentioned five substances
here, not expecting the reference to the sixth substance in the future."
Similarly, a question is raised while describing the 37th Sutra of this chapter.
It is said there, "This term **Gṛṇa** is mentioned in the texts of other sects.
In the **Ahata** view, only substance and category are mentioned. Therefore,
only two principles are established, and based on them, **Dravyarthic** and
**Paryayik** become two. If there is a substance called **guna**, then there
must be a third **naya** to make it its subject. Since there is no third
**naya**, therefore, no third substance called **guna** is established. And
therefore, the Sutra "**Gaṇaparyayavavṛddhyam**" also does not occur." Further,
while resolving this, it is said that this is not the case, because **guna** is
taught in texts like **Arhatpravacana Hṛdaya** etc. And further, the sentence
"**Upatan hi Arhatpravacane dravyashraya nirguna gunaha**" appears.  These two
references from **Tattvarthavartika** provide information about other
**Vrittis** and texts. From the first reference, we know that the author of
**Tattvarthavartika** had a **Vritti** written on **Tattvarthasutra** in front
of him, which mentioned five substances while describing the Sutra
"**Nityavasthananyaruparani**", and the author of **Tattvarthavartika** has
reconciled it here. And from the second reference, it can be assumed that the
author of **Tattvarthavartika** had another independent text called
**Arhatpravacana Hṛdaya** or **Arhatpravacana** in front of him, which was not
only written in the Sutra style but also contained the Sutra "**Dravyashraya
nirguna gunaha**", and possibly he considered it very ancient, because he has
mentioned it in support of **guna** in the present context.  The question of
what this **Arhatpravacana Hṛdaya** or **Arhatpravacana** is, is very serious.
It is also mentioned by the commentator of **Tattvarthabhashya**, Vacaka
Umasvati. He writes, "I am speaking for the benefit of the disciples of a small
text called **Tattvarthadhigama**, which is a collection of a part of
**Ahendvacana** and has many meanings." Similarly, Amritachandra...  1. See the
introduction to **Tattvarthasutra** by Pandit Sukhlalji. 2. If it is said that
"because five substances are mentioned in the **Vritti**, the teaching of six
substances does not occur", then no, because of the lack of understanding of the
intention. 3. "**Tattvarthadhigama** named, a small text, a collection of many
meanings. I will speak of this, a part of **Ahendvacana**, for the benefit of
the disciples." (22)

## Translation:  **44. Sarvarthasiddhi**  Acharya has called Samayaprabhrut as a
part of Arhatpravacana in his commentary on Samayaprabhrut.  Generally, both
these terms refer to the twelve angas of Jain scriptures. However, when
Bhattarak Akalankadev mentions a separate text called Arhatpravacanahriday or
Arhatpravacana, and even quotes a verse from it that closely resembles a sutra
from Tattvarthasutra, it raises the question: Did such a great text exist,
containing the secrets of the entire Jain philosophy, and was its mention
mandatory for everyone? Whatever the case, one thing is clear: The author of
Tattvarthavartika must have had access to other commentaries on Tattvarthasutra
besides the available ones, which were different from Sarvarthasiddhi and
Tattvarthabhashya. It is highly likely that he referred to this very commentary
in his Tattvarthavartika.  In this context, we have also discussed the
commentary of Siddhasena Ganika. We have already mentioned that Siddhasena
Ganika's commentary includes many different opinions and references regarding
the sutras. A close examination reveals that he had access not only to
Sarvarthasiddhi, Tattvarthabhashya, and Tattvarthavartika, but also to many
other old and new commentaries on Tattvarthasutra. This is also the opinion of
the wise scholar Pandit Sukhlalji, which we have already mentioned.  These
references in Sarvarthasiddhi, Tattvarthavartika, and Siddhasena Ganika's
commentary suggest the existence of many other small and large commentaries on
Tattvarthasutra. The question is, on what basis were these commentaries written?
It is clear that those mentioned in Sarvarthasiddhi and Tattvarthavartika were
independent. We only need to consider those mentioned by Siddhasena Ganika. It
is evident that due to Tattvarthabhashya, the form and meaning of the sutra text
are somewhat fixed. Some errors due to the carelessness of scribes are also
found in Tattvarthabhashya. However, due to these errors, it is not possible to
imagine any variations or interpolations in the entire sutra text in the
presence of Tattvarthabhashya. In such a situation, these commentaries must also
be considered independent, similar to those mentioned in Sarvarthasiddhi and
Tattvarthavartika. The way Siddhasena Ganika mentions other opinions while
pointing out differences of opinion also supports this fact.  We cannot say for
sure when these commentaries were written or who their authors were. It is
highly likely that all or some of them were written before Tattvarthabhashya,
and their authors were Svetambara Acharyas. If this assumption, which is more
likely to be true, is correct, then we have to say that Tattvarthabhashya was
written at a time when many commentaries and annotations on the original
Tattvarthasutra were already in circulation, one of which was Sarvarthasiddhi.
**2. Sutra References:**  Generally, commentators refer to previous or
subsequent sutras to clarify a topic, provide information, or connect the next
sutra. This practice is extensively followed in Sarvarthasiddhi and
Tattvarthabhashya. However, while referring to previous or subsequent sutras,
these commentaries only mention those sutra texts that they agree with. For
example, the author of Sarvarthasiddhi has accepted the 21st sutra of Chapter 1,
"Bhavapratyayavadhidevnarakanaam," in this form. Therefore, while writing the
introduction to the first sutra of Chapter 4, he mentions this sutra in the same
form. Similarly, the author of Tattvarthabhashya has accepted this sutra as
"Bhavapratyayavadhinarakavevaanaam."  1.
"Prabhrataahvayasyaharhatpravacanavayavasy" Ga. 1. Commentary. 2. See
Tattvarthabhashya on Chapter 6, Sutras 3 and 4.

## Introduction 45 This is why they quote it in this form in the first sutra of
the fourth chapter. Generally, these commentators quote the entire sutra in some
places and a part of it in others. But whatever part they quote is complete in
itself. There is no such inconsistency anywhere that while quoting a part, they
leave out any part of the beginning.  In such a situation, we assumed that it
would be difficult to find such a quotation in these two commentaries that would
raise doubts about their position. With this in mind, we carefully examined the
Sarvarthasiddhi and the Tattvarthabhashya. But we have to admit that while it is
not in the Sarvarthasiddhi, there is a slip in the Tattvarthabhashya at one
place which raises doubts about its position. This slip occurred while writing
the commentary on chapter 1 sutra 20. The Sarvarthasiddhi sutra which deals with
the subject of matigyan and shrutigyan is as follows: 'Matishrutayonibandho
dravyeshvasarvaparaya yeshu.' This same sutra is available in the
Tattvarthabhashya in this form: 'Matishrutayonibandhah
sarvadravyeshvasarvaparaya sha.' In the Tattvarthabhashya, the word 'sarva' is
accepted as an adjective to the word 'dravya' in comparison to the sutra text of
the Sarvarthasiddhi. But when the same Tattvarthabhashyakar quotes the latter
half of this sutra in the commentary on chapter 1 sutra 20, it takes the form of
the sutra text of the Sarvarthasiddhi. As: 'Atraha-matishrutyo stulya
vishayatvam vakshyati-'dravyeshvasarvaparaya yeshu' iti.' Perhaps the word
'sarva' might have been left out due to the carelessness of the scribe in this
mention, but it is not right to say so, because Siddhasenagani and Haribhadra
have also accepted this part of the Tattvarthabhashya in the same form in their
commentaries. The question is that when the Tattvarthabhashyakar accepted the
latter half of the said sutra as 'sarvadravyeshvasarvaparaya sha', why did he
leave out the word 'sarva' from it while quoting it elsewhere. It does not seem
reasonable to say that this happened due to forgetting the word. We admit that
he would not have done so out of negligence or intentionally, yet if this
inconsistency is considered to be due to forgetting, then there must be some
reason for it. We believe that the text of the Sarvarthasiddhi or the
Sarvarthasiddhi sutra must have been in front of him while writing the
Tattvarthabhashya and without paying special attention to what text we have
accepted, he quoted a part of the Sarvarthasiddhi sutra text here because it was
in front of him. It is also possible that until the time of writing the
commentary on chapter 1 sutra 20, he was not sure whether it would be necessary
to make the word 'sarva' an adjective to the word 'T' or whether the old sutra
text should be left in its original form and it is possible that due to not
being able to decide anything like this, he quoted the old text here. We admit
that he had already decided the form of the Tattvarthasutra before starting the
Tattvarthabhashya, yet it is possible to remain doubtful about the subject of a
particular sutra and to make changes in it while writing the Tattvarthabhashya.
Whatever may be the case, this mention does provide enough force to conclude
that the text of the Sarvarthasiddhi sutra must have been in front of the
speaker Umaswatike while writing the Tattvarthabhashya.  3. Development of
Meaning - Similarly, the clear manifestation of the development of meaning in
the Tattvarthabhashya in the image-reflection relationship between the two and
in the discussion of the object in some places also supports the said statement.
For example, the sutra 'dharmastikaya bhavat' comes in the tenth chapter. Before
this, it has been told that the liberated being goes up to the end of the upper
world due to such and such reasons. The question is why does he not go further
and in response to this, this sutra was composed mainly due to external causes.
But if we leave the commentary and only

---------------------------
If one reads the *Sarvarthasiddhi* sutras, one has to stop here and there, and
the doubt remains in the mind that what does the Acharya want to convey by not
being a *dharmasthika*. This situation came to the attention of the commentator
Umasvati, and he made it a part of the commentary instead of a sutra, with the
intention of clarifying this situation. This action seems to have been done
later. Similarly, consider the second sutra of this chapter in
*Sarvarthasiddhi*. Before this, the creation of *kevalgyan* from the absence of
*mohaniya* etc. karmas has been laid down. But why is their absence, a proper
answer is not found in that sutra, nor does the *Sarvarthasiddhikar* touch upon
this question. But this flaw bothers the commentator Umasvati. As a result, he
considers the first half of the sutra *Sarvarthasiddhimany pat hetvbhav
nirjarabhyam kritsnakarmavipramoksho moksha* as independent and the second half
as an independent sutra, thus fulfilling this deficiency. While in
*Sarvarthasiddhi* it is only connected with the word 'hastakarmavipramoksha',
there the commentator Umasvati explains it for both the previous and the next
sutra.  46  One such thing that deserves special attention comes from the
context of the sutra that expounds the benefit of time in the fifth chapter. The
topic is *paratva* and *aparatva*. Both of these are of how many types, this is
indicated in both *Sarvarthasiddhi* and *Tattvarthabhashya*. While explaining
their types in *Sarvarthasiddhi*, it is said - *parsvaparattve kshetrakrte
kalakrte cha stah*. But in *Tattvarthabhashya*, these two differences are
explained. Along with that, *prasansakrit* *paratva* and *aparatva* are also
accepted independently there. The commentator Umasvati says - *parsvaparattve
trividhe prasansakrte kshetrakrte kamakrte iti*.  Not only this, we see that in
this regard, the *Tattvarthavatikakar* follows the *Tattvarthabhashya* itself.
While explaining the sutra that expounds the benefit of time, he has mentioned
these three differences of *parsa* and *aparsva* in these words -
*'kshetraprasansakalanimitavaratvaparatvanavacharanamiti chet na
kalopakaraprakaranat'*.  Therefore, doesn't this help in concluding that just as
this example confirms the statement that *Tattvarthabhashya* was in front of the
*Tattvarthavartika* author, in the same way, it also confirms the statement that
*Tattvarthabhashya* is a later composition than *Sarvarthasiddhi*.  It is clear
that considering from the point of view of chronology, the time of composition
of *Tattvarthabhashya* is fixed after the composition of *Sarvarthasiddhi*, and
considering all the situations, it also seems correct.  **Citations of other
literature in *Sarvarthasiddhi***  While writing *Sarvarthasiddhi*, Acharya
Pujyapada had a vast literature in front of him, relying on which he enhanced
this great commentary. The prominent place that can be given to it is
*Shatkhandagama*.  *Shatkhandagama* - This is the great treasure that has
received the direct legacy of the *Dwadashanga* speech. Acharya Pushpadanta and
Bhootbali, sitting at the feet of Acharya Dharasen and studying a part of the
remaining *Dwadashanga* speech of that time, composed this great text. Its
*Jivasthan*, *Kshullakabandha*, *Bandhaswamitva*, *Vedana*, *Vargana* and
*Mahabandha*, these six sections contain the collection of *Dwadashanga* speech,
hence it is called *Mandagama*. This great text was in front of the
*Sarvarthasiddhikar* and he has also used it extensively, this is clearly known
from seeing the *Sarvarthasiddhi* commentary of *Tattvarthsutra* chapter one
sutra seven and eight. In it, by *nirdesha*, *swamitva* etc. and by *sat*
number, *kshetra*, *sparshan*, *kan*, *antar*, *bhav* and *pabahutva*, these
eight *anuyoga*, with the support of fourteen *gunasthan* and fourteen
*margana*, the *jiv* element is explained. 1. A. Su. 22 *Tattvavartika*.

## Introduction  The topic under consideration naturally draws the reader's
attention to the *Jīvasthāna* section of the *Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama*. The second sūtra
of the *Jīvasthāna* section is:  "**Etto imesi cohasanham jīvasamāsaṇam
magganaṭṭhadāe tattha imāṇi coddasa ceva dvāṇāṇi ṇāyavāṇi bhavanti.**"  This

regarding this topic: whether *sāsādanasamyakdrṣṭi* are born as *eke'indriyās*
after death. *Kṣayaprābhṛta* supports this school of thought. However, according
to the *Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama*, those *sāsādanasamyakdrṣṭi* who are born as
*eke'indriyās* after death, have a *mithyādrṣṭi* *guṇasthāna* at the time of
their first birth as *eke'indriyās* as a matter of rule. This is the reason why
the *Jīvasthāna* *satprūpaṇā* sūtras have a single *mithyādrṣṭi* *guṇasthāna*
for *eke'indriyās*.

##  **Sarvarthasiddhi**  The **Mithyadristi** guna-sthana is indicated. It is
clear from the comparison that Sarvarthasiddhikar also followed the same
tradition.  **Jiva-sthana Sankhya-Prarupana**  Sarvarthasiddhi Sankhya-
Prarupana, according to the flow of **Mithyadristi**, is as follows:  *
**Generally, the number of Jivas with Mithyadristi is infinite.** (2) * **From
**Sasan Sammaitrippahudi** to **Sanjada-Nantanantas**, the number of Jivas with
**Samyagdrishti** is infinite.** (6) * **The number of Jivas with **Asanyata
Samyagdrishti** and **Sanyata Samyagdrishti** is **Asankhyey** (uncountable).**
(6) * **The number of Jivas with **Pramatta Sanjada** is **Bhagapramita**
(measured by parts).** (7) * **The number of Jivas with **Pramatta Sanyata** is
**Kotiprithaktva** (measured by billions).** (7) * **The number of Jivas with
**Appramatta Sanyata** is **Sankhyeya** (countable).** (7) * **The number of
Jivas with **Uparshamaka** is **Sankhyeya** (countable).** (8) * **The number of
Jivas with **Uparshamaka** is **Sankhyeya** (countable).** (9) * **The number of
Jivas with **Aayogi** is **Sankhyeya** (countable).** (9) * **The number of
**Kevali** is **Sankhyeya** (countable).** (10) * **The number of **Sayogi
Kevali** is **Sankhyeya** (countable).** (11) * **The number of **Sayogi
Kevali** is **Sankhyeya** (countable).** (12) * **The number of **Sajogikevali**
is **Sankhyeya** (countable).** (13) * **The number of **Sajogikevali** is
**Sankhyeya** (countable).** (14)  Here, we have compared some of the principles
of **Jiva-sthana** and **Sankhya Prarupana**. This comparison of all the
**Prarupanas** is based on the concept of **Bimb-Pratibimb** (image-reflection).
It is clear that Sarvarthasiddhikar has presented the **Prarupana** of the
**Sarasankhya** etc. sutras keeping in mind the eight **Anuyogadwaras** of
**Jiva-sthana**. While writing Sarvarthasiddhi, Pujyapada Swami had not only
**Jiva-sthana** in front of him, but also the **Chulika** and other sections.
For this, see the **Sarvarthasiddhi** commentary on the first chapter of
**Tattvarthasutra**, which mentions the **Nirvesha Swamitva** etc. sutras. It
explains the causes of the origin of **Samyaktva** based on the **Chulika
Anuyogadwar** of **Jiva-sthana**. Similarly, the time of **Uparshama** etc.
**Samyaktvas** is explained based on **Kshullakabandha**.  **A. Kundakunda**  In
the Jain tradition, **Acharya Kundakunda** is considered a prominent figure
among the **Shrutadhara** Acharyas who influenced the times. Based on some
facts, it is said that he received the benefit of direct darshan and teachings
from **Simandhar Tirthankara** in the **Videha Kshetra** and was blessed with
**Charan Riddhi**. Following the tradition, he presented a clear direction of
**Jain Tattva-gyan** in accordance with the path of **Moksha**, influencing the
entire Jain tradition. **Jain Tattva-gyan** supports individual freedom and the
only way to achieve it is through self-reliance. The way he presented this truth
in beautiful words is unmatched. He was a radiant sun in the Jain tradition,
illuminating all directions. In **Bodhaprabhut**, he declared himself as the
disciple of **Shruta Kevali Bhadrabahu**. Starting **Sayaprabhrut**, he says, "I
am narrating the **Samayaprabhrut** as spoken by **Shruta Kevali**. These words
cannot be accidental. It is highly likely that he received direct or traditional
knowledge of **Tattva-gyan** from **Bhadrabahu Shruta Kevali**, because the
special features of the literature created by him cannot be accidental. The
discussion about accepting **Vastra-Patra** (clothes and utensils) has greatly
obscured the **Tattva-gyan** of the Jain tradition.  1. **"Barahangaviyani

## Introduction  The only literary tradition composed by them is a ray of light
that breaks through this darkness and illuminates the path of righteousness. On
the one hand, to call everything except the soul and the absolute soul-related
emotions, even the relative emotions residing in the soul, as "other," and on
the other hand, to point out the acceptance of clothes and utensils as the path
of individual freedom, what else can be said except that it is a mere irony of
knowledge? We firmly believe that a religion that proclaims the independent
existence of every individual and rejects the dominance of external authority by
negating theism can never advocate the acceptance of clothes and utensils as a
necessary part of the path to liberation. If Acharya Kundakunda has clarified
any fact, it can only be this. Some scholars believe that he had a singular
insistence on nudity and that this was emphasized in the Jain tradition only
after him. But it seems that they want to change the direction of Jain
philosophy through this accusation. In Jain philosophy, the consideration of an
object is based solely on individual freedom, therefore, what else can be the
path to its attainment except self-reliance? The acceptance of other substances
by an individual is due to his fickleness and passions. It cannot be that an
individual accepts clothes and utensils and is also considered free from
attachment both externally and internally. It is clear that Acharya Kundakunda,
by declaring nudity, has advocated the same path that the infinite Tirthankaras
have been showing since time immemorial. Such great Acharya's works like
Samayaprabhuta, Pravachansara, Panchaastikaya, Niyamasara, Dvadasha Anupreksha
and Ashtabhuta etc. are available at present. Acharya Pujyapada has made full
use of this literature, which is well known from the web of Sarvarthasiddhi.
Acharya Pujyapada has quoted ten such verses, out of which one verse is
available in Panchaastikaya, one verse in Niyamasara, three verses in
Pravachansara and five verses in Dvadasha Anupreksha. We have shown in the
commentary at those places which chapter of those texts these verses belong to.
## Mulaachar  Mulaachar is the first text that advocates the conduct of monks,
accepted in the Digambara tradition. Its author is Acharya Vattkeera. Our fellow
scholar, Pandit Heeralaalji Shastri, has interpreted "Vattkeera Acharya" as
"Vartka Elaacharya" and has inferred Acharya Kundakunda as its author. His 2-3
articles on this subject have been published in this year's Anekanta, which
present a new direction of thought. But it does not seem possible to reach the
conclusion from those articles that Acharya Kundakunda has given it a concrete
form. In Mulaachar, there is a chapter named Dvadasha Anupreksha. Acharya
Kundakunda has independently composed the "Barah Anupekkha" text. At least this
suggests that the author of the Mulaachar text should be Acharya Vattkeera, not
Acharya Kundakunda. Viraseen Swami has mentioned it as Aachaarang in Dharala
Tika and has quoted a verse from it. Here, Acharya Pujyapada has also given two
verses of it in Sarvarthasiddhi.  ## Panchasangrah  Panchasangrah holds a very
important place in the Digambara tradition. In this regard, we had shed light in
the preface of the Shwetambara Granthasaptatika, expressing the possibility that
its compilation had already taken place before the Shwetambara
Panchasangrahkartaa Chandrashimhattar. Two verses of it have also been quoted by
Acharya Pujyapada in Sarvarthasiddhi. This indicates that it is very likely that
the compilation of the Digambara tradition-accepted Prakrit Panchasangrah took
place before Acharya Pujyapada. Now this text has become available and has come
to light. Acharya Amitagati has compiled the Sanskrit Panchasangrah based on
this.  ## Paniniya Vyakaran  Acharya Pujyapada himself has written "Jainendra
Vyakaran" and on it, the Nyasa of...

## Sarvarthasiddhi  It is well-known that the author of Sarvarthasiddhi is the
same person who wrote it. Therefore, there is a doubt that he might have only
mentioned the sutras of the Jainendra grammar he created in Sarvarthasiddhi.
This question was before us during the time of the editor of Sarvarthasiddhi,
and from this perspective, we also looked at Sarvarthasiddhi. However,
considering the sutras mentioned in it, we have reached the conclusion that
there was no such insistence on his part to only quote the sutras of the
Jainendra grammar he created. Although the mention of sutras in Sarvarthasiddhi
is very rare, the way they are mentioned in two or three places shows that both
Panini and Jainendra grammars were used in this work. For example:  Firstly, we
see the mention of two sutras in the commentary of Sarvarthasiddhi on chapter 4,
sutra 19. The first one is 'tad asminn asti iti', and the second one is 'tasya
nivasah'. The first sutra is available in Panini's grammar as 'tasminn asti iti
des tamnami 4 267', and in Jainendra grammar as 'tavasminn asti iti desah khi 4,
1, 14'. Therefore, it is difficult to say whether Acharya Pujyapada has relied
on Panini's sutra or Jainendra's sutra here. The second sutra is available in
Panini's grammar as 'tasya nivasah 4, 2, 69', and in Jainendra grammar as 'tasya
nivasadur bhayoh 3, 2, 19'. It is clear that Acharya Pujyapada has mentioned the
sutra of Panini's grammar here.  In the commentary of Sarvarthasiddhi on chapter
5, sutra 1, the sutra 'visheshanam visheshyen iti' is mentioned. Jainendra
grammar has marked this in the same form at number 1, 3, 52, and in its place,
the sutra of Panini's grammar is 'visheshanam visheshyen bahulam'. It is clear
that Acharya Pujyapada has mentioned the sutra of his own grammar here.  This
was the discussion about the sutras. Now, look at another evidence - in the
commentary of chapter 5, sutra 4, Acharya Pujyapada has mentioned the word
'mevetyah'. But there is neither any sutra in Jainendra grammar to prove the
word 'nitya' nor any indication of the 'ty' suffix. There is the 'y' suffix in
place of the 'ty' suffix. This shows that Acharya Pujyapada has written this
sentence keeping in mind Katyayana's Varttika 'tyabane dhruva iti vaktavyam 4,
2, 104'. Acharya Abhayanandi has definitely created this Varttika 'vam iti
vaktavyam' in his Vritti. But it is a later composition. Still, the said word is
definitely controversial.  In the light of these facts, it becomes clear that
Acharya Pujyapada has used Panini's grammar as well as Jainendra grammar in his
Sarvarthasiddhi commentary, and it becomes clear that he wrote the
Sarvarthasiddhi commentary only after the creation of Jainendra grammar. In the
commentary of Sarvarthasiddhi on chapter 10, sutra 4, Acharya Pujyapada has used
the term 'ka' for the fifth case ending. Acharya Pujyapada has defined seven
case endings in his Jainendra grammar by adding 'ma' to the consonant letters of
the word 'vibhakti' and 'v' to the vowel - ba, ipu, bha, ap, ka, ta, ipu.
According to this, 'ka' is the indication of the fifth case ending. This is also
an evidence that indicates that Jainendra grammar was created before
Sarvarthasiddhi was written.  Katyayana wrote Varttikas on the grammar sutras of
Panini. In the commentary of Sarvarthasiddhi on chapter 7, sutra 16, Acharya
Pujyapada has quoted his Varttika 'ashvavrishabhayo maithuneshchaayam' by
calling it 'shastra'. This is the first Varttika of Katyayana on Panini's 7, 1,
51.  Patanjali Mahabhashya - Patanjali Rishi has become a great scholar in the
Vedic tradition. The Patanjali Mahabhashya available on Panini's grammar at this
time is his immortal work. He is also the author of Yogadarshan. This is clear
from it.

## Introduction "I bow down to Patanjali, the best among the sages, who has
removed the impurities of the mind through Yoga, the impurities of speech
through grammar, and the impurities of the body through medicine."  There is
disagreement about the time period of Patanjali Rishi. However, it is certain
that he did not exist before the second century BCE. At present, we have the
Patanjali Mahabhashya and the Sarvartha Siddhi. A comparative study of these two
reveals that the literature of Acharya Pujyapada, especially the Sarvartha
Siddhi, has been deeply influenced by the Patanjali Mahabhashya. Observing both,
it becomes clear that there are many passages in the Sarvartha Siddhi that are
adorned by the support of the Patanjali Mahabhashya. To clarify this, look at
the following comparison:  ## Patanjali Mahabhashya * **Sarvartha Siddhi:**
Whether it is a rule or a prohibition that follows. * **Patanjali Mahabhashya:**
Whether it is a rule or a prohibition that follows. Many words have the same
meaning. For example, * **Sarvartha Siddhi:** Even though there is a difference
in nature, due to the strength of usage, there are synonyms like Indra, Shakra,
Puruhut, Purandara. * **Patanjali Mahabhashya:** Like Indra, Shakra, Purandara.
Anudara kanya. * **Sarvartha Siddhi:** Like Anudara kanya. There is a number-
indicating word. For example, one, two. * **Patanjali Mahabhashya:** Number-
indicating words like one, two, many. * **Sarvartha Siddhi:** Many. Bahurodano
bahu supa. * **Patanjali Mahabhashya:** Bahurodano bahu supa. When a rule is
started after something is established, it is for the purpose of knowledge. *
**Sarvartha Siddhi:** When a rule is started after something is established, it
is for the purpose of regulation. I think you will go by chariot. * **Patanjali
Mahabhashya:** Come, I think you will go by chariot, you will not go. *
**Sarvartha Siddhi:** You have gone to your father. It was a future action. A
son will be born. * **Patanjali Mahabhashya:** Vishvadrushva, his son is born.
It was a future action. * **Sarvartha Siddhi:** It should not be. The use of
words is for the purpose of understanding meaning. Meaning is conveyed. *
**Patanjali Mahabhashya:** Or, the use of words is for the purpose of
understanding meaning. There, one word is used to express one meaning, because
that meaning has already been expressed by one. The use of synonymous words is
pointless. The second and third should not be used. The use of words that have
already been expressed is not allowed. One thread is not strong enough for a
cloth, but a group of them is. * **Sarvartha Siddhi:** There is a thread that is
not strong enough for a cloth, but a group of them is strong enough. One rope is
not strong enough for binding, but a group of them is strong enough. These
senses sometimes act independently. * **Patanjali Mahabhashya:** The desire for
independence is seen. This eye of mine sees well. * **Sarvartha Siddhi:** This
eye of mine sees well. This ear of mine hears well. * **Patanjali Mahabhashya:**
This ear of mine hears well. Sometimes they are desired to be dependent. *
**Sarvartha Siddhi:** In the world, the desire for dependence of the senses is
seen. I see well with this eye. I hear well with this ear. * **Patanjali
Mahabhashya:** I see well with this eye. I hear well with this ear. *
**Sarvartha Siddhi:** In fast, medium, and slow actions, the counting is
different due to the difference in time. * **Patanjali Mahabhashya:** Counting.
* **Sarvartha Siddhi:** The analysis by parts, the whole, the meaning of the
compound. * **Patanjali Mahabhashya:** The analysis by parts, the whole, the
meaning of the compound.

## Sarvarthasiddhi Here. Patanjali Mahabhashya Sarvarthasiddhi, the indication
of the cause, and the mere occasion in begging, etc. Even in the mere occasion,
the designation of the cause and the agent is seen. From seeing. The indication
of the cause should also be seen in the mere occasion. As long as. Just as the
dung fire teaches. He would say, "The cause is the occasion," until then, he is
confused. What is the purpose? From seeing in begging, etc. Even in begging,
etc., it is seen that they live by begging, the dung fire teaches, etc. - He
returns with wisdom. This man who is a spectator ...'He returns with wisdom.
Thus, he becomes a former spectator. He sees. This man who is a spectator, he
sees. Just as clarified butter and oil are said to be mixed. Just as clarified
butter and oil are said to be mixed. It is understood that they are one. It is
understood that they are one. The remainder of the sentence and the sentence
itself are subject to the speaker. The remainder of the sentence and the
sentence itself are subject to the speaker. Ratnakarandaka - This is a famous
text of the Digambara tradition. It explains the nature of Dharma and explains
Dharma as Samyagdarshan, Samyagjnana and Samyakcharitra, and discusses these
three jewels in five chapters, hence it is called Ratnakarandaka. But while
expounding Samyakcharitra, it only mentions all the charitra and mainly
elaborates on Vikalcharitra (Shravakaachar), hence it is also called
Ratnakarandaka Shravakaachar. Generally, it is famous that it is the immortal
work of Acharya Samantabhadra Swami, a famous Acharya of the Digambara
tradition. All the ancient mentions found so far confirm this fact.
Prabhachandra Acharya himself, who wrote a detailed Sanskrit commentary on it,
also considers it to be the work of Swami Samantabhadra. As is evident from the
Pushpika found at the end of each chapter. In such a situation, Ratnakarandaka
must have been available to Acharya Pujyapada while writing Sarvarthasiddhi.
Further, we present some such mentions of these two texts which help in making
inferences about this subject. The mentions are as follows: 1. The nature of
Vrata is expressed in Ratnakarandaka in these words: 'Abhimanshikrita
Virativishayayogan Vratam Bhavati ||3, 30||' The same thing is expressed in
Sarvarthasiddhi in these words: 'Vratam Abhisandhikrito Niyamaḥ. 7 11'
Ratnakarandaka gives these five names for Anarthadanda - Papopadeśa, Hinsadaan,
Apadhyan, Dushruti and Pramadacharya. These same five names are also seen in
Sarvarthasiddhi. Not only this, an unprecedented similarity of words is also
seen regarding some of their characteristics. For example -
'Tiryakleshavaanijyahi Saarambhapralambhanaadinaam. Kathaprasangaprasavaḥ
Smartavyaḥ Papopadeśaḥ ||' Ratna 3 ||
'Tiryakaraleshavaanijyapraanivaadhakarambhaadishu Paapasamyuktam Vachanam

'Prayojanam Antareṇ Vrukshaadi Chhevanabhumikuttanasalilasechanaaghavadyakarma

## Introduction  The similarity in meaning and words in the description of
*bhogopbhogavat* or *upbhogparibhogavat* in these two texts is truly remarkable.
Both texts explain the types of *bhog* and *upbhog*, and preach the abandonment
of much *jasghāt* and evil. Only the *Ratnakarandaka* specifically instructs the
abandonment of *anupsevy*. The *Ratnakarandaka* mentions this as follows:  "To
abandon *sati*, milk and meat, to abandon *pramada*, the feet of the Jinas are
the refuge. || 3,38 ||"  "The *shrungaverani*, which are of many types and have
little fruit, like butter, neem flower, and *tak*, are to be abandoned. || 3,39
||"  "That which is *padanishta*, and that which is *anupsevy*, should also be
abandoned. || 3,40 ||"  See the *Sarvarthasiddhi* on the same topic:  "Always
abandon *mama*, with a mind free from *jasghāt*. *Ketaki*, *arjuna* flowers,
*bhṛngaveramūlaka* and other things, which are the cause of many births and are
worthy of the designation of *anantakāya*, should be abandoned, because they
have many dangers and little fruit. || 17, 22 ||"  Despite this remarkable
similarity, there are some differences between these two texts. The first
difference is that the *Ratnakarandaka* defines the word *proṣadha* as *satkṛd
mukti*, while the *Sarvarthasiddhi* defines it as *parva*. The second difference
is that the *Ratnakarandaka* mentions the eight *mūlaguṇa* independently, while
the *Sarvarthasiddhi* does not mention them at all. Therefore, there is a doubt
that if the *Sarvarthasiddhi* is considered to be a later work than the
*Ratnakarandaka*, then this difference should not be seen. We can ignore the
meaning of the word *proṣadha*, as there is no objection to accepting it in the
sense of *parva*. Even then, the instruction of the eight *mūlaguṇa* and the
question of their absence is very important.  Any reader who looks back to
ancient times will see that the eight *mūlaguṇa* were not mentioned separately
in the duties of a *śrāvaka* in the past. Instead, *samāyika* etc. six *karma*
were prevalent. This mention first appears in the *Ratnakarandaka*.  (Self) Dr.
Hiralalji doubts that the *Ratnakarandaka* is a work of Śrī Swami Samantabhadra.
The main reason for his opinion is that Vādirāja Sūri, in his
*Pārśvanāthacarita*, after mentioning Śrī Swami Samantabhadra, the author of the
*Devāgama*, first mentions Ācārya Pūjyapāda, the author of the *Jainendra
Vyākaraṇa*, using the word "Dev", and then remembers the author of the
*Ratnakarandaka*, addressing him as "Yogindra". Dr. Sahib believes that this
"Yogindra" must be different from Śrī Swami Samantabhadra, who appears to be
later than Ācārya Pūjyapāda. This is why Vādirāja Sūri remembers Ācārya Yogindra
after Ācārya Pūjyapāda in his *Pārśvanāthacarita* and calls him the creator of
the *Ratnakarandaka*. He has given many other proofs in support of this, but
this is the main proof.  (Self) Śrī Paṇḍit Jugalkishorji Mukhtar, in the preface
of the *Ratnakarandakavyākhyā*, published by the Māṇikacandra Granthamālā, has
examined the *Ratnakarandaka* internally and expressed the possibility that the
form in which it is available today is not its original form. Due to the
carelessness of scribes and commentators, many interpolated verses have become
part of the original. We believe that this verse, which advocates the eight
*mūlaguṇa*, has also become part of the original in this way. Although Mukhtar
Sahib does not consider the verse advocating the eight *mūlaguṇa* to be
interpolated, he has not given any specific reason for this. He only concludes
by saying...  1. See *Pārśvanāthacarita*, Canto 1, verses 17, 18 and 19,
published by the Māṇikacandra Granthamālā. 2. See, Preface, pages 15 to 53.

## 54 ## Sarvarthasiddhi  It has been said that the absence of a mention of the
eight fundamental virtues in the *Ratnakaranda*, or rather, in a text dealing
with the conduct of lay followers, leaves a significant gap in the text, a gap
that one would not expect from an experienced author like Swami Samantabhadra.
We acknowledge that the mere mention by Vadirajsuri cannot be taken as proof
that the *Ratnakaranda* is not a work of Swami Samantabhadra, as he does not
strictly follow chronological order in his mentions of the Acharyas. For
example, in Chapter 1, verse 20, he mentions Akalanka, and then in verse 22, he
remembers the author of the *Sammati*. It is also possible that due to the
carelessness of a scribe, the verse mentioning the *Ratnakaranda*, "**त्यागी स
एव योगीन्द्रः**" (the renunciant, he is the king of yogis), was mistakenly
placed after the verse "**अचिन्त्यमहिमा देवः**" (the god of inconceivable
glory). These verses appear in this form in the printed editions.
**स्वामिनश्चरितं तस्य कस्य नो विस्मयावहम् । देवागमेन सर्वतो येनाद्यापि प्रबर्यते
॥ 1, 17॥ अचिन्त्यमहिमा देवः सोऽभिवन्द्यो हितैषिणा। शब्दाश्च येन सियन्ति साधुत्वं
प्रतिलम्भिताः।। 1, 18॥ त्यागी स एव योगीन्द्रो येनाक्षय्यसुखावहः । अथिने भव्यसाय
विष्टो रत्नकरण्डकः ॥ 1, 19॥**  However, reading verse 19 after verse 17, the
phrase "**त्यागी स एव योगीन्द्रः**" clearly refers to Swami Samantabhadra, and
it is possible that Vadirajsuri mentioned this verse again with the intention of
revealing the authorship of the *Ratnakaranda*. But even if we accept the
*Ratnakaranda* as a work of Swami Samantabhadra based on this possibility and
other evidence, the absence of the eight fundamental virtues in it remains a
point for consideration.  Our opinion is that the classification of the eight
fundamental virtues and their inclusion in the conduct of lay followers occurred
around the same time that the three categories of lay followers - *pakshika*,
*naishthika*, and *sadhaka* - were established and the foundation for the
exposition of the conduct of lay followers was laid. The *Ratnakaranda* contains
certain seeds that suggest its compilation took place long before the
development of other texts on the conduct of lay followers. Therefore, it is
possible that the mention of the eight fundamental virtues in the *Ratnakaranda*
is an interpolation. This possibility becomes even stronger when we consider the
context in which this verse mentioning the eight fundamental virtues is
included. Before this verse, Swami Samantabhadra discusses the five *anuvratas*
along with their transgressions, and later he discusses the seven *sheelavratas*
along with their transgressions. This verse appears between these two
discussions, making it seem out of place.  ## Yuktyanusasan  Another immortal
work of Swami Samantabhadra, similar to the *Ratnakaranda*, is his
*Yuktyanusasan*. In this work, he establishes the rule of the victorious Jinas
through logical arguments, praising them. At one point, he states that he is not
the guru of those who seek happiness and consider it a form of attainment by
worshipping the gods through offerings of flowers, etc. The verse is as follows:
**'शीर्षोपहारादिभिरात्मदुःखदेवान् किलाराध्य सुखाभिगद्धाः। सियन्ति
बोषापचयानपेक्षा युक्तं च तेषां त्वमषिनं येषाम् ॥'**  Now, read this passage from
*Sarvarthasiddhi* in light of this verse:  **"तेन
तीर्थाभिषेकदीक्षाशीर्षापहारदेवताराधनादयो निवतिता भवन्ति । अ० 9, सू० 2 की
टीका."**  This comparison reveals that the aforementioned statement from
*Yuktyanusasan* was present before Acharya Pujyapada.  -  1. See Introduction,

## Introduction  55 Siddhsen Divakar, a very great Acharya, emerged in the
middle of the 5th and 6th centuries Vikram era, after the Dwatrimsatka-Acharya
Pujyapada and Swami Samantabhadra. He is mentioned with great respect by the
Digambar Acharyas. His work, the Sanmatitarka Granth, is famous. He is also
considered to be the author of many Dwatrimsatkas. Acharya Pujyapada, in his
commentary on the Sarvarthasiddhi, chapter 7, sutra 13, has quoted the phrase
"Vijojayati chasubhih", which seems to be taken from his Siddhdwatrimsatka.
Similarly, some verses, poems, and sentences are quoted in the Sarvarthasiddhi,
the source of some of which we have not yet been able to determine accurately,
and some are found in texts compiled or composed after the Sarvarthasiddhi.
Here, we have introduced only those texts that were definitely in front of
Acharya Pujyapada.  **Mangalacharan:** This auspicious verse appears at the
beginning of the Sarvarthasiddhi:  "Mokshamargasya netaram bhetaram
karmabhubhritam. Jnataram visvatattvanam vande tadgunalabdhye."  Here, the
question is whether this auspicious verse is a part of the Tattvarthasutra or
the Sarvarthasiddhi. Most scholars are in favor of considering it a part of the
Tattvarthasutra. They present these reasons in its support:  Firstly, most of
the ancient handwritten copies of the Tattvarthasutra available have this
auspicious verse at the beginning. Secondly, Acharya Vidyānanda, in his
Aaptapariksha, has mentioned it as belonging to the Sutrakar. For example:  "Ki
punastatparameshtino gunastotram shastrachi sutrakarahaprairiti nigadyate."
Acharya Vidyānanda did not stop there. He concludes the Aaptapariksha by saying:
"Shrimadtattvarthashastraatasalilnisheritratnodbhavasya, proththanarambhakale
sakalamalabhiveshastrakaraha kritam yat. Stotram tirthopamanam prathitethapatham
swamiimaamsitam tat, Vidyānanaivaih swashaktā kathamapi kathitam
satyavakyārthasiddhye." || 123 ||  At the time of the creation of the wonderful
ocean of the Tattvarthasastra, which is the source of excellent gems, the
Sutrakar, with the intention of breaking all the karma-mala, composed the
stotra, which is like a pilgrimage, and which is famous for its path to
liberation. Swami has contemplated on it. Vidyānanda has described it in some
way, according to his ability, for the sake of the truth of the words.  He
repeated the same thing in these words:  "Iti tattvarthashastraavo
munindrastotragocara. Pranitāptaparikshayam vivadavini vrttaye." || 124 ||
Thus, this Aaptapariksha, which is the subject of the Muni's stotra, is composed
at the beginning of the Tattvarthasastra to remove disputes.  These mentions in
the Aaptapariksha are unambiguous. They show that Acharya Vidyānanda considers
the aforementioned auspicious verse to be the work of the author of the
Tattvarthasutra.  1. See Bharatiya Vidya, Part 3, page 11. 2. See Jinsen's
Mahapurana. 3. See Puratan Jain Vakyasuchi, Introduction, page 132.

## All-Encompassing Success  However, these arguments are presented in support
of the fact that the author of this auspicious verse is not Acharya Gaddapichch,
the author of the Tattvarth Sutra:  1. If the author of this auspicious verse
were the creator of the Tattvarth Sutra himself, Acharya Gaddapichch, and this
auspicious verse had been available to Acharya Pujyapada along with the
Tattvarth Sutra, then he would have definitely written his commentary on it. He
would not have made it a part of the Sarvarthasiddhi without a commentary.  2.
Acharya Pujyapada clearly indicates through the initial Uththani of the
Sarvarthasiddhi that the sutra "Samyagdarshanajnanacharitranimokshamargah" was
first revealed from the mouth of Acharya Gaddapichch at the request of a Bhavya.
This indicates that the occasion for him to offer an auspicious invocation did
not arise.  3. Bhatta Akalankdeva, the commentator of the Tattvarthavatika, also
does not consider this auspicious verse to be a part of the Tattvarth Sutra.
Otherwise, he would have definitely commented on it and would not have accepted
the Uththani which Acharya Pujyapada has directed at the beginning of the
Sarvarthasiddhi. From the perspective of the commentator of the Tattvarth Sutra,
Acharya Vidyānanda's position is no different from Bhatta Akalankdeva's. He also
did not comment on this auspicious verse in the Tattvarthashloka Vatika. Not
only that, both these Acharyas have not included it at the beginning of their
commentary texts.  These are two opinions that do not help in reaching a single
conclusion. Nevertheless, we consider the arguments of the first opinion to be
more factual because even about a thousand years ago, when the auspicious verse
was considered to be of the author of the Tattvarth Sutra, it seems irrelevant
to doubt it.  3. The question of the authenticity and inauthenticity of the old
tradition-scripture by the author of the Tattvarth Sutra is a very important
topic. In ancient times, all scripture writers did not mention their name,
lineage, caste, place of residence, etc. at the beginning or end of the
scripture, because they did not consider themselves to be the creators of that
scripture. Their main task was to simply compile the twelve-fold speech of the
Lord, received from tradition, in a concise, detailed, or translated form. They
knew very well that giving their name, etc. along with a scripture does not
increase its universal acceptance or authenticity. In most scriptures, it is
said by Jinendradeva at various places, "This is what Jindeva has said," "This
is the teaching of Jindeva," "We say as the omniscient Jindeva has said," with
the mention of these words, their subject matter is discussed. Why? Because it
should be understood that this is not the opinion of a particular individual,
but the speech of the omniscient Jindeva or its essence. In fact, the
interpreters of the meaning of any scripture are not hypocrites, but are
dispassionate omniscients. The hypocritical Ganadharas only compile their
teachings in the form of a scripture after listening to their teachings. This
compilation comes down through tradition and becomes the subject of knowledge of
various Acharyas, giving birth to many scattered scriptures. The ancient
Acharyas understood this fact very well and therefore, they remained free from
the delusion of name and form and were engaged in compiling the twelve-fold
speech. Acharya Pushpadanta, Acharya Bhootbali, Acharya Gunadhar, Acharya
Yativrishabha, Acharya Kundakunda, Swami Samantabhadra, Acharya Siddhasena
Divakara and Acharya Pujyapada, etc. are many such Acharyas who followed this
path and compiled the speech of the Lord Tirthankara and dedicated it for the
welfare of the world. Why only that, Acharya Gaddapichch is also one of them who
compiled a gem of a scripture like the Tattvarth Sutra based on the remaining
entire Shruta and made it famous by name.  1. 'Bhanio Khalu Samvadarasihi

## Introduction  This tradition of keeping oneself free from attachment has been
prevalent since ancient times. The more widespread this practice was, the more
respect the Shruta-dhara Acharyas had for it.  Today, the difficulty in
compiling the biographical sketches of Shruta-dhara and other Acharyas, along
with a factual history of their works, stems from this very reason. We call it a
difficulty in the sense that this period is about compiling historical facts,
and therefore, more emphasis is placed on determining which Acharya lived in
which era, what their daily life was like, and what their notable works were.
In this context, we need to consider the author of the Tattvartha Sutra. As
beautiful and captivating as the compilation of the Tattvartha Sutra is from a
religious perspective, there is just as much debate surrounding its author. This
debate has been further fueled by the two traditions that emerged within the
Jain Sangha over time. The first debate revolves around the author's name, and
the second concerns the time of their existence. Here, we will first present the
irrefutable evidence that helps us determine the author of the Tattvartha Sutra,
and then shed light on the facts that have caused this debate.  ## The Author of
the Tattvartha Sutra  We will see later that Acharya Pujyapada has written
extensively on various subjects. Yet, he has never mentioned his name anywhere.
Not only that, but even when writing his commentary, Sarvarthasiddhi, on the
Tattvartha Sutra, he follows the same path. He instructs in its introduction
that a Bhavy, sitting in an ashram among a gathering of monks, approaches
Acharya Vardhamana with humility and asks a question, and as a result, the
Tattvartha Sutra is composed. However, he remains silent about the names of
those Acharyas. Why? We understand from this that even though Acharya Pujyapada
was aware of the information regarding the author of the Tattvartha Sutra, he
avoided mentioning his name, perhaps to avoid any sense of self-importance.
Bhatta Akalankadeva has also followed the same path. He too accepts the same
introduction in the beginning of the Tattvartha Vartika that Acharya Pujyapada
mentioned in the beginning of the Sarvarthasiddhi. Therefore, even though these
mentions lead us to believe that these Acharyas were aware of the author's name,
they do not reveal who the Acharya was who made this great effort for the
welfare of Bhavy beings.  We believe that this practice of not mentioning names,
particularly in the Jain tradition, continued in India until the 4th and 5th
centuries CE. Some Acharyas continued this practice even after that. However,
due to several reasons, this policy began to change, and scholars started
mentioning their names at the beginning or end of their works. Not only that,
they also began to mention their predecessors in other ways. Therefore, to
accurately determine the author of the Tattvartha Sutra, we must delve into
later literature. So, let's first look at the irrefutable evidence from later
times that sheds light on this subject.  ## Evidence from Later Literature  1.
Acharya Vīrasena, a great commentator in the tradition of the Shruta-dhara
Acharyas, completed his famous Dhavala commentary on the Panḍagam in the year
738 of the Saka era. His commentary contains numerous references and historical
facts. He has quoted many sutras from the Tattvartha Sutra in this commentary.
Not only that, but in the Jīva-sthāna-kāla-anuyoga-dvāra, he quotes a sutra from
the Tattvartha Sutra along with the name of its author. He says:  "Harīyāsiyat-
chatyamu-le vi vartana-pariṇāma-kriyāḥ paratva-aparatve cha kālasya chhavi bacha
kālo pakavido mudrita prishtha 316"

##  58 **Sarvarthasiddhi**  This mention is clearly stated in the
Tattvarthasutra by Gṛddhapichchācārya.  2. Ācārya Vidyānanda was also a great
Śrutadhara Ācārya. He has enhanced the glory of Jain Śruta by composing many
scriptures like Aṣṭasahasrī, Vidyānanda Mahodya, Āptaparīkṣā, Pramāṇaparīkṣā,
Patraparīkṣā, Satyaśāsanaparīkṣā and Tattvārthaśloka Vārtika etc. His time of
existence is considered to be from 775 AD (Śaka Samvat 697) to 840 AD (Śaka
Samvat 762). He writes on page 6 of the printed Tattvārthaśloka Vārtika:  "Etena
Gatapichchācāryaparyantamunisūtreṇa Vyabhicārata Nirastā."  By this, Ācārya
Vidyānanda indicates that the last Sūtrakāra in the reign of Bhagavan Mahāvīra
was Gṛddhapichchācārya.  Clearly, this mention indicates all the Sūtrakāras up
to Ācārya Gṛddhapichchā, the author of Tattvārthasūtra. However, Paṇḍit
Sukhlālji has doubts about this. He has expressed this doubt in the preface of
his own written Tattvārthasūtra on pages 106-107. His doubt is particularly
based on logic, so here we must first consider it from this perspective.
Paṇḍitji's argument is that the aforementioned second statement has come up in
the discussion of inference that proves the point that the Sūtra on the path to
liberation in the Tattvārthādhigama Śāstra is composed by the omniscient,
dispassionate one. In this discussion of inference, the Sūtra on the path to
liberation is the subject, the fact that it is composed by the omniscient,
dispassionate one is the object to be proved, and the fact that it is a Sūtra is
the reason. In refuting the fallacy of irrelevancy in this reason, Vidyānanda
has made the statement "Etena" etc. The fallacy of irrelevancy is possible in a
place different from the subject. The subject is the present Tattvārthasūtra on
the path to liberation. From this, the Sūtra of the Munis up to
Gṛddhapichchācārya, which is considered to be the subject of irrelevancy, should
be different from the first Sūtra on the path to liberation, which is the
subject of Umāsvāti, in the view of Vidyānanda. This point hardly needs to be
explained to a student of Nyāya Vidya.  The essence of Paṇḍitji's logic-based
statement is that the Sūtra of the Munis up to Gṛddhapichchācārya, which Ācārya
Vidyānanda has mentioned here, is different from Umāsvāti's Tattvārthasūtra.  As
far as Paṇḍitji's statement is concerned, we should not accuse it of being
unreliable. However, if Paṇḍitji had paid attention to the subsidiary point
raised by Ācārya Vidyānanda in the context of the aforementioned inference, we
believe that he would not have tried to prove that the Sūtra of
Gṛddhapichchācārya is different from the so-called Tattvārthasūtra of Umāsvāti.
The subsidiary point raised by Ācārya Vidyānanda is the refutation of the
fallacy of irrelevancy by considering the Sūtra statements of Gaṇādhipa,
Pratiyaka Buddha, Śruta Kevali and Abhinna Daśa Pūrvi as self-composed. It is
clear that Gṛddhapichchācārya's Tattvārthasūtra is also included in this,
because here it is considered to be different from the Sūtra composed by the
omniscient, dispassionate one in some way (from the perspective that the author
is Gṛddhapichchācārya). It would be particularly appropriate to clarify this
matter in these words in the present context. In the present inference, the
present Sūtra is the subject, the fact that it is composed by the omniscient,
dispassionate one is the object to be proved, the fact that it is a Sūtra is the
reason, the remaining Sūtra composed by the omniscient, dispassionate one is the
similar subject, and the Sūtra of Bṛhaspati etc. is the dissimilar subject. By
this inference, the Tattvārthasūtra has been proved to be composed by the
omniscient, dispassionate one through the reason of its being a Sūtra. This
proves that Ācārya Vidyānanda is not proving the Sūtra to be composed by
Gṛddhapichchācārya here. He forgets the fact that from the perspective of being
a Sūtra, it is composed by Gṛddhapichchācārya. He says that it is composed by
the omniscient, dispassionate one, therefore it is a Sūtra.  However, if someone
says that this Tattvārthasūtra is not composed by the omniscient, dispassionate
one but by Gṛddhapichchācārya,  1. See the preface of Āptaparīkṣā edited by
Nyāyācārya Paṇḍit Darbārilālji and published by Vīrasevamandīra, page 50.

## Introduction 59 If, in such a situation, the *Tattvartha Sutra* authored by
the omniscient, *Veetrag* (freed from passions), is somehow different from the
*Tattvartha Sutra* authored by *Giddhapiccha* Acharya, then it will fall into
the category of the opposing side, similar to the Sutras authored by *Ganadhara*
etc., which are considered to be on the opposing side in the inference. And
accepting it as a Sutra will lead to the contradiction of the reason. Acharya
*Vidyananda* has presented this contradiction and refuted it, stating this
entire statement along with the conclusion:  "If it is said that there is a
contradiction with the Sutra of *Ganadhip*, *Pratyekabuddha*, *Shruta Kevali*,
and *Abhinna Dasha Purvi* due to self-agreement? No, because of the statement
that even those are authored by the omniscient, *Veetrag*, and the meaning is
explained by *Gan* (community). Thus, the contradiction with the Sutra up to
*Giddhapiccha* Acharya is refuted."  Here, a contradiction is shown with the
Sutra of *Ganadhip*, *Pratyekabuddha*, *Shruta Kevali*, and *Abhinna Dasha
Purvi*, considering it to be self-created. Even if the *Tattvartha Sutra* is
considered to be authored by *Giddhapiccha* Acharya, this contradiction arises
because the *Tattvartha Sutra* authored by the omniscient, *Veetrag*, is the
*sadhya* (probandum) in the aforementioned inference, not the *Tattvartha Sutra*
authored by *Giddhapiccha* Acharya. Therefore, the *Tattvartha Sutra* authored
by *Giddhapiccha* Acharya becomes the opposing side because it is against the
*sadhya*. We accept that there is only one *Tattvartha Sutra*, not two, but they
are considered to be two due to the difference in the author. One is the one
authored by the omniscient, *Veetrag*, and the other is the one authored by
*Giddhapiccha* Acharya. Therefore, just as it was desirable to refute the
contradiction arising with the Sutra of *Ganadhip* etc., it was also necessary
to refute the contradiction arising from considering it to be authored only by
*Giddhapiccha* Acharya. And this is why this contradiction is refuted by the
statement "Etena" etc.  Thus, we see that Acharya *Vidyananda*, similar to
*Veerasen Swami*, appears to follow the same opinion that the author of the
*Tattvartha Sutra* is Acharya *Giddhapiccha* Acharya. Even if we leave aside
this argument-based method for a while and give priority to the opinion of the
scholar, there is no obstacle in accepting the opinion that Acharya
*Vidyananda*, through the statement "Etena" etc., is indicating *Giddhapiccha*
as the author of the *Tattvartha Sutra*. Because Acharya *Vidyananda* had
already established the *Tattvartha Sutra* authored by *Giddhapiccha* Acharya as
a Sutra through the aforementioned inference, but it was still left to establish
the composition of other previous Acharyas as a Sutra, which he has established
by refuting the contradiction arising with the Sutra of other *Ganadhip* etc.
Munis, up to *Giddhapiccha* Acharya, i.e., *Giddhapiccha* Acharya is the last
one. Here, *Atadgunasanvijnana* is a *Bahuvrihi* compound, so this meaning is
concluded.  The implication is that there is a Sutra text authored by
*Giddhapiccha* Acharya, which is also accepted by Pandit *Sukhlalji*. He only
has a dispute in accepting the present *Tattvartha Sutra* as his. But when he is
established as the author of the *Tattvartha Sutra* from other historical facts,
the meaning of the aforementioned statement of Acharya *Vidyananda* appears to
be the same as we have done.  3. Acharya *Giddhapiccha* is mentioned with
respect by *Vadiraj Suri* in his *Parshvanath Charit*. Possibly, this is the
same *Vadiraj Suri* who wrote *Praman Nirnay*, *Ekibhav Stotra*, *Yashodhar
Charit*, *Kakusthavarit*, and *Nyaya Vinishchay Vivaran* along with *Parshvanath
Charit*. It is said about him:  "Vadiraj is the name of the Shambika world,
Vadiraj is the name of the Takik Singh. Vadiraj is the name of the poet, Vadiraj
is the name of the one who is helped by others."  He mentions Acharya
*Giddhapiccha* in *Parshvanath Charit* with these words:  "I bow down to
*Giddhapiccha*, who has an abundance of excellent qualities. The noble ones who
are born for Nirvana consider him as a bird."

## Sarvarthasiddhi  I bow to those great qualities, which act as wings for the
worthy who desire to fly to Nirvana.  Although Vadirajsuri does not mention any
other name of Acharya Gudhapichchha here, he is remembering those scholars who
have benefited the world by creating literature useful for the path of
liberation. In the eyes of Vadirajsuri, Acharya Gudhapichchha, the author of
Tattvarth Sutra, is the first among them.  The first two mentions of these are
from the 9th century Vikram era, and the last mention is from the 11th century.
This shows that until this time, the only accepted belief in the Jain tradition
was that Acharya Gudhapichchha was the author of Tattvarth Sutra.  ## Other
Opinions  However, there are three or four other opinions against this view,
which are relevant to discuss here.  1. At the end of the Shvetambar Tattvarth
Bhashya, a eulogy is available. It states that "Those whose initiation guru was
Ghoshanandi Ksaman, the holder of eleven Angas, and whose preceptor was the
chief speaker Shivsri, whose guru in terms of recitation was the speaker named
Mula, and whose preceptor was the great speaker Mundapad, who belonged to the
Kobhishani gotra, and who was the son of Swati father and Vatsi mother, who was
born in Nyagrodhikagrama and belonged to the Uccha Nagar branch, those Uma Swami
Vachka, having properly absorbed the excellent Ahendvachan received from the
guru tradition, and seeing the suffering people with their minds destroyed by
the inaccessible path, out of compassion for beings, while practicing this
Tattvarthadhigam named scripture, composed it in the great city of Kusumpur.
Whoever knows this Tattvarthadhigam and follows the path mentioned in it, will
soon attain the ultimate goal called Avyabadha Sukha."  Similarly, in the
beginning of the Tattvarth Bhashya, there are 31 Uththaniika Karikas, of which
the 22nd Karika states that "I speak this short Pratyaka called
Tattvarthadhigam, which is a collection of a part of Ahendvachan and has many
meanings, for the benefit of the disciples."  Prajna Chakshu Pandit Sukhlalji
gives special importance to this Karika of Uththaniika and the final eulogy. He
considers them to be from the original Sutrakar.  Apart from this, he has given
two more arguments to prove that the Tattvarth Sutrakar and the Tattvarth
Bhashyakar are the same.  (a) In the initial Karikas and at some other places in
the Bhashya, there is a first-person pronoun like "Vakyami", "Vakyam:" etc., and
according to the promise made in this pronoun, the statement is made later in
the Sutra. This leaves no doubt in considering both the Sutra and the Bhashya as
the work of one person.  (b) Looking at the Bhashya from beginning to end, one
thing settles in the mind, and that is that there is no manipulation of words in
interpreting the Sutra anywhere, there is no doubt or alternative in
interpreting the Sutra anywhere, similarly, the meaning of the Sutra is not
interpreted keeping in mind any other interpretation of the Sutra, and nowhere
has the reading of the Sutra been relied upon.  2. Pandit Nathuramji Premi has
almost the same opinion. His final article on this subject was published in the
third part of Bharatiya Vidya. He has presented the same three arguments of
Pandit Sukhlalji with some changes in words while proving that the Tattvarth
Sutra and the Tattvarth Bhashya are the work of the same person. Only these
two...  1. See the eulogy found at the end of the Tattvarth Bhashya. 2. See the
introduction to the Tattvarth Sutra written by them. 3. Pandit Sukhlalji's
introduction to the Tattvarth Sutra, page 21.

## Introduction  61 If there is any difference in the opinions of scholars, it
is only that Pandit Sukhlalji considers Uma Swami to be of the Savastra
Svetambar tradition, while Premiji considers him to be of the Yapaniya
tradition.  3. Some inscriptions are found on the Chandragiri mountain in
Shravanabelagola, which state that Gaddapichch was the author of the Tattvarth
Sutra. In these inscriptions, only Uma Swami is mentioned with the epithet
Gaddapichch in the 40th, 42nd, 43rd, 47th, and 50th inscriptions, and in the
105th and 108th inscriptions, he is called the author of the Tattvarth Sutra.
According to Dr. Hiralalji, these two inscriptions are dated to the Saka year
1320 and Saka year 1355 respectively. The inscription 155 reads as follows:
'Srimanmaswatirayam Yatishastastvarthsutram prakaticakar.
Yanmuktimargacharanodhatanam patheyam adhyam bhavathi prajanam ||15|| Tasyaiva
sisya Ujani Gapichchdvitiyasanjnasya Balakapichch. Yatsushitaratnani bhavanthi
loke muktyanganamo hanamananaani ||16||'  The Lord Uma Swami, the head of the
Yatis, revealed the Tattvarth Sutra, which serves as an excellent guide for
those who are engaged in the practice of the path of liberation. Gaddapichch is
the second name of Balakapichch, a disciple of Uma Swami. His wise sayings are
like ornaments that adorn the path of liberation and dispel delusion.
Inscription 108 records the same thing in this way:  'Abhuvumaswatimuni pavitra
vamshe tabiyee sakalarthavedee. Sutrikritam yena jinpranitam shastrarthajatam
manipungavena ||11||' 'Sa pranisamrakshanasavadhano babhar yogi kil gadhapkshan.
Tada prabhutyeva busha yamahur acharyashamdottaragayapichch ||22||'  Although
many small and large commentaries have been written on the Tattvarth Sutra at
different times, only one Kannada commentary by the 13th-century scholar
Balachandra Muni is known, which mentions the name Gaddapichcharya along with
Uma Swami.  4. Pandit Jugul Kishorji Mukhtar follows this same opinion regarding
the authorship of the Tattvarth Sutra. He considers Gaddapichch to be another
name for Uma Swami.  5. In the Digambar tradition, the copies of the original
Tattvarth Sutra that are available have a verse at the end:
'Tattvarthsutrakarim gadapichchopalakshitam. Vande ganindrasanjatam
umaswamimunishvaram ||'  This verse identifies Uma Swami, who is known as
Gaddapichch, as the author of the Tattvarth Sutra and calls him a Ganindra.  6.
An inscription in Nagar Taluka mentions:
'Tattvarthsutrakaramamaswatimunishvaram. Shrutakevalideshiyam vande'ham
gunamandiram ||'  This inscription mentions Uma Swami as the author of the
Tattvarth Sutra and calls him Shrutakevalideshiya and Gunamandira.  7. There is
also mention of Acharya Kundakunda being the author of the Tattvarth Sutra,
which is contrary to the Tattvarth

---------------------------
##  The Author of Tattvarth Sutra: A Critical Analysis  **62** **Sarvarth
Siddhi** is one of the most important commentaries on the Tattvarth Sutra. A
Shvetambar commentator of the Tattvarth Sutra was also familiar with this view.
He mentioned this view in his commentary and tried to warn his community.
**Review:** There are seven different views regarding the author of the
Tattvarth Sutra. Except for the mention of the early Shvetambar Tattvarth
Bhashya, all other mentions are not from before the 13th century and mainly
point to the two names, Gṛddhpiṭcha and Umāsvāti. The final view that "Acharya
Kundakunda is the author of the Tattvarth Sutra" seems unusual, but it seems
that this view gained popularity because Acharya Kundakunda was known by the
name Gṛddhpiṭcha. There are two main views that need to be considered here.
First, Acharya Gṛddhpiṭcha is the author of the Tattvarth Sutra, and second, the
commentator Umāsvāti wrote the Tattvarth Sutra.  Generally, while discussing the
topic of "Tattvarth Sutra," we have shed light on many important points by
writing the section "Differences of Opinion in Sutra Texts" and comparing
Sarvarth Siddhi and Tattvarth Bhashya through the section "Prioritization
Consideration." The summary of these points is as follows...  1. The commentator
Umāsvāti wrote the Tattvarthadhigama Shastra. But this name is not of the
Tattvarth Sutra but of the Tattvarth Bhashya. 2. While mentioning the
differences of opinion in the Sutra texts, it has been proven and explained that
if the authors of the Tattvarth Sutra and Tattvarth Bhashya were the same person
and the Shvetambar Acharyas understood this fact, then there should not have
been as much difference of opinion in the Shvetambar Sutra texts as is
available. 3. While considering the prioritization of Sarvarth Siddhi and
Tattvarth Bhashya, we have explained that many commentaries on the Tattvarth
Sutra were already in circulation before the commentator Umāsvāti wrote the
Tattvarth Bhashya. There, we also mentioned a Sutra that is related to the
Sarvarth Siddhi-approved Sutra text and which the commentator Umāsvāti has
quoted in his Tattvarth Bhashya. Considering the development of meaning, it has
also been explained in this section that when Sarvarth Siddhi and Tattvarth
Bhashya are considered together, it is clear that there are many instances that
prove the Tattvarth Bhashya to be a later composition than Sarvarth Siddhi. And
while proving this, we have also given an example that in the section on the
benefits of time, only two distinctions have been made in Sarvarth Siddhi
regarding Paratva-Aparatva, while three are available in the Tattvarth Bhashya.
Therefore, even after it becomes clear from these and other facts that the
commentator Umāsvāti should not be the original author of the Tattvarth Sutra,
it is necessary to pay attention to some other points for the final decision on
this subject.  To determine the community, etc., of any author, the scripture
written by him is the main evidence. There are some seeds in any scripture that
shed important light on the time of composition of that scripture and the
community of the author, etc. While considering the time, etc., of the author of
the Tattvarth Sutra, the wise scholar Pt. Sukhlalji has also adopted this
approach. But there, he has tried to consider both the Tattvarth Sutra and the
Tattvarth Bhashya as one. This has caused a lot of confusion. In fact, this
matter should be considered only by keeping the Tattvarth Sutra in front, and
even in that, only those Sutras of the Tattvarth Sutra should be considered
which are accepted by both communities in the Tattvarth Sutra. This helps a lot
in reaching a single decision through an impartial review.  1. Pt.
Kailashchandraji's Tattvarth Sutra, Introduction 50 171 2. For this, see the
introduction to the Tattvarth Sutra written by us. 3. See Dr. A.N. Upadhye's
introduction to Pravachansara. 4. See the introduction to the Tattvarth Sutra

## Introduction  It is clear that even though there are two versions of the
Tattvartha Sutra, most of the sutras are accepted by both sects. Among these,
some sutras have remained in their original form, shedding light on the author's
position, etc. Here, we present four main sutras from this consideration. The
first sutra is about the causes of bondage for the Tirthankara nature, the
second is about the twenty-two parishahs, the third is about the eleven
parishahs of the Kevali Jina, and the fourth is about how many parishahs a
single being has at the same time.  1. Both traditions mention the causes of
bondage for the Tirthankara nature in their original Agamas. The Digambara
tradition, in its Bandhasamittvichya, mentions the same sixteen causes that are
almost accepted in the Tattvartha Sutra in the same form. For comparison, see:
> Darshanavishuddhivinayasampannata
Shilvateṣvanaticharo'bhiṣaṇajñānopayogasanvego Śaktitastyāgatapasi Sādhusamāṣiyā

Nanivacchajogajuttadaae Iccedehi Solasehi Karanehi Jivaa Tithyayaranamgovam
Kamma Bandhati.  > - Bandhasamittvichya 75041.  However, the Svetambara
tradition accepts twenty causes instead of sixteen. In the eighth chapter of the
Anga called Jnatridharmakatha, these causes are mentioned in these words:  >
'Arahanta-siddhi-pavajana guru-ther bahussuae tavassisuṁ. Bachchalaya ya tesi
abhikkanṁ jaṇovoge ya॥1॥ Basaviṇae avaśśae ya solamśae niraiyāram. Khaṇalava
tavacchiāe veyāvacche samāhi ya॥2॥ Apugvaṇāṇagahaṇṁ suyabhatti pavaṇe
phabhāvaṇaya. > E ehi karanehi tithyayarattaṁ lahai jivo ॥3॥'  Here, two things
are worth noting in the Tattvartha Sutra: first, the mention of the number
sixteen, and second, the similarity in words. In this regard, the mentioned
sutra of the Tattvartha Sutra is closer to the Digambara tradition than the
Svetambara tradition.  2. Both the Digambara and Svetambara traditions accept
twenty-two parishahs. The sutra in the Tattvartha Sutra that mentions these
parishahs includes one called 'Nagnya'. The question is why the author of the
Tattvartha Sutra accepted the word 'Nagnya'. Can this word be accepted as being
in accordance with the Agamas according to the Svetambara tradition? In the
Agamas of the Svetambara tradition, the word 'Achel' is mentioned everywhere in
place of the 'Nagnya' parishah. This is in line with that sect, because the word
'Achel' has the 'Nan' compound, which in that sect implies both the absence of
clothes and 'few clothes'. However, these two meanings cannot be derived from
the word 'Nagnya'. 'Nagna' is an independent word, and its only meaning is
'without covering of clothes'. It is clear that these two meanings cannot be
derived from the word 'Nagnya'. 'Nagna' is an independent word, and its only
meaning is 'without covering of clothes'. It is clear that this is the twenty-
two parishahs...  1. See, A09 Su09. 2. Samavayanga Samavay 22 and Bhagavati

## Translation:  64 The Sutra that establishes the principle of
*Sarvarthasiddhi* is closer to the Digambara tradition than the Svetambara
tradition.  3. Considering how many *parishahs* a being can experience
simultaneously, the Svetambara Agamic literature (Vyakhyaprajnapti, Shloka 8)
states that a being who binds seven or eight types of karma has 22 *parishahs*.
However, such a being experiences only 20 *parishahs* simultaneously. Explaining
which two *parishahs* are reduced, it is stated that when the being experiences
the *sheet* *parishah*, it does not experience the *ushna* *parishah*, and when
it experiences the *ushna* *parishah*, it does not experience the *sheet*
*parishah*. Thus, one *parishah* is reduced. Similarly, when it experiences the
*charya* *parishah*, it does not experience the *nishadya* *parishah*, and when
it experiences the *nishadya* *parishah*, it does not experience the *charya*
*parishah*. Thus, another *parishah* is reduced. In total, there are 20
*parishahs* that the being experiences simultaneously.  However, the *Tattvartha
Sutra* defines the maximum number of *parishahs* that can be experienced
simultaneously as 19. We do not need to consider what is logically correct here.
We only need to point out that this instruction by the author of the *Tattvartha
Sutra* does not follow the Svetambara Agamic tradition.  4. "There are eleven
*parishahs* for Jinas." We have already discussed this Sutra in detail in the
section "Textual Variations and Interpretations." There, we clarified the
author's perspective on *parishahs* by stating that the author's focus is
primarily on the internal causes. By stating how many *parishahs* are present in
the emergence of each karma, the author indicates the number of *parishahs*
based on the differences in the recipients. However, this does not mean that the
author accepts the existence of the same number of *parishahs* as mentioned for
internal causes, as a rule. In the final Sutra of the *parishah* section, the
author has also separately established the principle of *parishahs* based on
their function. He states that although there are 22 *parishahs* in total, a
being can experience one to nineteen *parishahs* simultaneously. It is clear
that in light of this final Sutra, it cannot be concluded that the author of the
*Tattvartha Sutra* accepts the function of *parishahs* in the same way he has
established the number of *parishahs* present in the emergence of karma-created
*parishahs*. It only means that even if the internal causes are present, if the
external causes for those *parishahs* are not present, then there will be no
*parishahs* at all. This is why the author mentions the possibility of
experiencing one to nineteen *parishahs*. For example, if all the karmas of a
negligent, restrained ascetic are to emerge, all *parishahs* are possible.
However, if there are no external causes for their *parishahs*, they will not
experience any *parishahs*. If there is an external cause for one *parishah*,
then they will experience one *parishah*, and if there are external causes for
more *parishahs*, then they will experience more *parishahs*. The implication is
that the experience of *parishahs* cannot be attributed solely to the presence
of internal causes. It is clear that the author of the *Tattvartha Sutra* does
not accept the function of *parishahs* solely based on the presence of internal
causes. He has only mentioned the *parishahs* based on the internal causes where
they are present.  From this perspective, we have examined the Svetambara Agamic
literature. However, it appears that a completely different perspective is
adopted there. There, it is accepted that all *parishahs* are experienced,
except for the opposing *parishahs*, out of all the possible *parishahs*. There,
it is not accepted that:  1. *Tattvartha Sutra* 409, Sutra 171 2. See, page 25
onwards.

## Introduction 65 Some experience pain for one, some for two, and some for
many. It is stated that those who bind seven or eight karmas have fourteen
possible parishahs, but they experience pain for only twenty at a time. Those
who bind six karmas have fourteen possible parishahs, but they experience pain
for only twelve at a time. Those who are vitaraga, chham-sth, and bind one karma
also have fourteen possible parishahs, but they experience pain for only twelve
at a time. Those who are sayogi jinas, who bind one karma, have eleven possible
parishahs, but they experience pain for only nine at a time. And those who are
abandhak, ayogi jinas, also have eleven possible parishahs, like the sayogi
jinas, but they experience pain for only nine at a time.  Therefore, even here,
through a comparative study of the Tattvarth Sutra and the Svetambara Agama
literature, we reach the same conclusion that the Tattvarth Sutra author, while
establishing the 'Ekadasha Jine' sutra, is closer to the Digambara tradition
than the Svetambara tradition.  This is an examination of some sutras of the
Tattvarth Sutra, which also helps us to decide that the Tattvarth Sutra author
must be different from the commentator Umaswati.  However, there is no ancient
mention in the Digambara tradition of any Acharya named Umaswati or Umaswami.
The inscriptions of Shravanabelagola or any other evidence that is found is
later than the mentions that declare the Tattvarth Sutra to be the work of
Acharya Gaddapichchki. Therefore, firstly, their credibility in this matter
cannot be trusted. Secondly, Gaddapichchki has been accepted as a name or in the
form of an epithet.  ## Sirseniya Commentary Pandit Sukhlalji, in the
introduction to his Tattvarth Sutra, has presented one or two mentions from the
commentaries of Siddhasena Gani and Haribhadrasuri, trying to prove that the
Tattvarth Sutra author and its commentator are the same person. But these
mentions are doubtful. For example, in the commentary of Siddhasena Gani, at the
end of the seventh chapter, the available pushpika mentions
'Umaswativachkopastrabhaadhye padako panditji bhaashyakar aur sutrakar ek vyakti
hain', trying to prove that the commentator and the sutra author are the same
person. But the direct meaning of this phrase is - the sutra commentary made by
Umaswati Vachka. Here, the phrase 'Umaswativachkopajna' is related to the
commentary, not the sutra. The second evidence presented by Panditji is from the
Siddhaseniya commentary of the 22nd sutra of the 9th chapter. But this evidence
is also doubtful, because the ancient copies of the Siddhasena Gani commentary
available have the phrase 'krutatra sutrasanniveshamabhittyoktam' in place of
'swakrut sutrasanniveshamaashrittyoktam'. It is very possible that some scribe,
with the intention of showing Umaswati as the commentator of the Tattvarth
Sutra, corrected 'krutatra' to 'swakrut' and later this reading became
established.  Generally, we have independently examined the Siddhasena Gani
commentary, so on this basis, we accept that there are some mentions in it that,
in the view of Siddhasena Gani, prove the Tattvarth Sutra and the Tattvarth
Bhashya to be the work of the same person. The first mention is from the
Siddhaseniya commentary of the sutra 'Ache Paroksham' of the first chapter.
Here, Siddhasena Gani, while explaining the part 'vyakhya prajnaptti sha 8. 2',
says: 1. Vyakhya Prajnaptti Sha 8. 2. 2. See the introduction of their Tattvarth
Sutra, page 17, footnote 1. 3. See Siddhaseniya Commentary, Chapter 9, Sutra 22,
page 253, footnote.

## Sarvarthasiddhi  "The author of the treatise, dividing himself into the
Sutrakar and the Bhashyakar, says, 'Shaasti' - the Sutrakar is implied. From the
synonym, there is a difference in the synonym. Another synonym is the Sutrakar,
another is the Bhashyakar. Therefore, the Sutrakar synonym is 'Shaasti'."  It is
stated that "the author of the treatise has divided himself into two parts, the
Sutrakar and the Bhashyakar, and says 'Shaasti'." Therefore, here, to indicate
the doer of the action 'Shaasti', the word 'Sutrakar' should be added. Or, the
synonym should be considered different from the synonym. Therefore, the same
author is different as the Sutrakar synonym and different as the Bhashyakar
synonym. Therefore, the author should be considered as connected with the
Sutrakar synonym.  A similar mention is found in the Siddhaseniya commentary on
the 'Nirupabhoga Mantram' Sutra of Chapter Two. In it, the Sutrakar and the
Bhashyakar are stated to be inseparable. The mention is as follows:  "Even
though the Sutrakar is undivided, the Bhashyakar necessarily divides due to the
reliance on the Vyuchchitti (synonym) Nayas."  Thus, although these mentions
indicate that Siddhasena Gani considered the Tattvartha Sutrakar and the
Tattvartha Bhashyakar to be one person, it cannot be assumed that this was his
definite opinion. He has also expressed an opinion in his commentary, which,
when considered, proves that the Sutrakar and the Bhashyakar are different. For
this, one should see the commentary on the 'Matyaadi Maam' Sutra of Chapter
Eight.  Here, the question before Siddhasena Gani is that when other Acharyas
accept the 'Matibhutaavashimanahparyayakevalaamaam' Sutra, should the actual
form of the Sutra be considered as 'Matyaadinaam', or should it be considered as
the other Acharyas read it? While resolving this doubt, he first relied on the
reasons, but seeing that he himself was not satisfied with this, he says that
since the Bhashyakar has also interpreted this Sutra in the same way, therefore,
'Matyaadinaam' should be the Sutra. His commentary, which expresses the entire
context, is as follows:  "Others read it again as
'Matibhutaavashimanahparyayakevalaanaam'. Thus, the Apakaapaatha is observed.
Then, after that, the five divisions, Jnanaavaranadaya, are mentioned. And the
creator himself has explained it in the first chapter. Therefore, the word
'Aadi' is also appropriate. The Bhashyakar also interprets the meaning of the
Sutra in the same way."  Here, the words 'Bhashyakaro-' etc. are noteworthy. In
this statement, the Bhashyakar is not directly connected with the creation of
the 'Matyaadinaam' Sutra, but with its meaning. This proves that here,
Siddhasena Gani considers the Sutrakar to be different from the Bhashyakar.
Otherwise, he would have established the inseparability of the Sutrakar and the
Bhashyakar from some perspective, and supported it through his language in such
a way that it would firmly support the fact that the Sutrakar, who is
inseparable from the Bhashyakar, has created the 'Matyaadinaam' Sutra.  As far
as our opinion is concerned, based on these aforementioned mentions, we reach
only this conclusion that the original Tattvartha Sutrakar and the Tattvartha
Bhashyakar are different individuals. Siddhasena Gani's position on this matter
has been doubtful, because sometimes he considers the Tattvartha Sutrakar and
the Tattvartha Bhashyakar to be one person, and sometimes two. Looking at this
situation, it seems that by the time of Siddhasena Gani, the belief that the
Tattvartha Bhashyakar is the original Tattvartha Sutrakar had not become firmly
rooted. This is the reason why Siddhasena Gani was unable to definitively
present any one opinion.  Panditji - Thus, even though the commentary of
Siddhasena Gani leaves the question of who is the author of the Tattvartha
Sutra, Umaaswaati, unresolved, here we have to consider the evidence of
Prajnaachakshu Pandit Sukhlalji on this subject.

## Introduction  It appears necessary to consult. The three arguments they
presented on this subject, we have already referred to on page 62. The first
argument is the eulogy found at the end of the 22nd Karika of the Uttanika and
the Tattvarthabhashya. Of these two places, the Uttanika Karika promises to
speak of a short treatise called Tattvarthadhigam, and in the final eulogy, the
commentator Umashvati says that he composed the Tattvarthadhigam Shastra. Based
on this, the scholar wants to prove that the author of the Tattvarthsutra is the
commentator Umashvati. But we have already proven and explained this earlier (on
page 17) that the name Tattvarthadhigam does not belong to the Tattvarthsutra
but to the Tattvarthabhashya. Umashvati himself does not call the
Tattvarthadhigam a Sutra but addresses it as a Granth or Shastra, and further,
while explaining the purpose of composing the Tattvarthadhigam, he says in the
22nd Uttanika Karika that it is difficult to understand the ocean of words, the
inaccessible Granthabhashya. It is not hidden from historians that the
commentaries on the Agam texts mentioned here by Umashvati were composed in the
7th century Vikram. While even before these, many commentaries like Sarvarth
Siddhi were written on the Tattvarthsutra. In such a situation, it makes no
sense to prove Umashvati as the author of the original Tattvarthsutra based on
the 21st Uttanika Karika and the final eulogy.  The scholar's second argument
states that the study of the Tattvarthabhashya suggests that there is no
contradiction in interpreting the Sutra in the Tattvarthabhashya, etc. Here, the
point is to consider whether the Tattvarthabhashya is in the state as the
scholar proclaims or not. From this perspective, we have also studied the
Tattvarthabhashya, but we find many places in it that make the situation of the
Tattvarthabhashya questionable from this perspective. For example:  1. In the
Tattvarthsutra, Samyagdarshani and Samyagdristi are not considered different.
There, in Chapter 7 Sutra 23, even someone who has Samyagdarshan is called
Samyagdristi, who is susceptible to doubts and other defects. But contrary to
this, in the Tattvarthabhashya, independent explanations of both Samyagdarshani
and Samyagdristi are given, making them different from each other. It is said
there that one who has Abhinibodhik knowledge is called Samyagdarshani, and one
who has Kevalgyan is called Samyagdristi. It is clear that here, the commentator
of the Tattvarthabhashya does not follow the Tattvarthsutra and presents his two
interpretations of the term Samyagdristi, contrary to the Tattvarthsutra. In one
place (Chapter 1 Sutra 8), he accepts something, and in another (Chapter 7 Sutra
23), he abandons it.  2. In the Tattvarthsutra, Mati, Smriti, and Sanjna, etc.,
are synonymous names for Matijnana. But the commentator of the
Tattvarthabhashya, instead of considering them synonymous names, considers
Matijnana, Smritijnana, etc., as independent knowledge based on the Sutra "Matih
Smritih" etc. Siddhasena Divakara also explained them as independent knowledge
based on the Tattvarthabhashya. To say that general Matijnana is comprehensive
and special Matijnana, Smritijnana, etc., are its objects, does not seem
logical, because Matijnana deals with the present meaning. When the commentator
himself accepts this fact, in such a situation, Mati, Smriti, etc., can only be
synonymous names for Matijnana, not different knowledge. And in the Agamas of
the Digambara and Svetambara traditions, they are considered synonymous with
Matijnana.  1. See Uttanika Karika 21 and the final eulogy of the
Tattvarthabhashya. 2. Mahato'timahaviṣayasya durgamagranthabhāṣyapārasya. Kaḥ

## Sarvarthasiddhi  This is a synonym. It is clear that here too, the commentary
of the Tattvarthabhashyakara does not follow the original sutra.  3. The
Tattvarthabhashyakara, while explaining the sutra "Kshetrakalagati" in chapter
10, has considered "Shabda", "Samabhirudha" and "Evambhuta" as the three
fundamental Nayas, whereas he himself accepts these three in the first chapter
in the sutra text where only one Shabdnaya is accepted as the fundamental Naya.
Clearly, his acceptance of three Nayas like Shabda etc. as fundamental in the
10th chapter and acceptance of one Shabdnaya as fundamental in the first chapter
is contradictory.  4. The Shvetambar Tattvarthsutra, chapter 2, sutra 52,
accepts the text "Charamvehottamapurusha". The Tattvarthabhashyakara initially
accepted this term and explained it. But later, he abandons the term
"Usmapurusha" and accepts only the term "Paramveha" and concludes with it. This
shows that the Tattvarthabhashyakara must have received two texts of this sutra
with some variations. He initially explained one text considering it as the main
one. But seeing the objections that arise from accepting it, he accepted the
other text at the time of conclusion. It is clear that this greatly undermines
the belief that the Tattvarthabhashyakara is the author of the Tattvarthsutra.
5. The Tattvarthsutra, chapter 4, sutra 4, lists 10 categories of each
Devanikaya, including Indra. But the Tattvarthabhashyakara, along with these ten
categories, also accepts an eleventh category called "Anikadhipati". Similarly,
in the 26th sutra of the same chapter, nine categories of Laukantika Devas are
listed, including Sarasvata, but the Tattvarthabhashyakara accepts only eight
categories in his commentary instead of nine. He says, "These Sarasvata etc.
eight types of Devas are in the Brahma Loka, in the east, north, etc., in a
clockwise direction, as per their number."  These are the evidences that go
against the aforementioned belief of the scholar. It is clear that even on the
basis of the scholar's aforementioned belief, the Tattvarthabhashyakara cannot
be considered the author of the Tattvarthsutra.  The third belief of Pandit
Sukhlalji is that in the initial karikas and in some places in the commentary,
there are references to first-person verbs like "Vakyami, Vakyamha" etc.,
therefore, the Tattvarthsutrakar and the Tattvarthabhashyakara are the same
person. But this is not a strong argument of the scholar. Often commentators use
such verbs to establish identity with the original author. For example, see the
commentary on Sarvarthasiddhi of chapter 1, sutra 1, the Uthanika
"Tattvarthavatika" of chapter 8, sutra 1, the commentary of Haribhadra on
chapter 8, sutra 1, and the Uthanika of Siddhasena Ganika on chapter 10, sutra
1. Here Siddhasena Ganika says, "Now the result of that is Moksha, we will
explain it." "Only knowledge arises, it never was, is, or will be without it,
therefore, we will explain only the origin of knowledge." Therefore, even on
this basis, the Tattvarthabhashyakara, Uma Swami, cannot be proved to be the
author of the Tattvarthsutra.  Shvetambar Pattavalis - Looking at the Shvetambar
Pattavalis also confirms this situation. The oldest among them are the
Kalpasutra Staviravali and the Nandisutr Pattavali. But they do not mention the
time. Time calculation is in the later Pattavalis. It is said that the Nandisutr
Pattavali was compiled in 510 VS. They do not mention the names of Uma Swami and
his gurus.  1. Shabdadayasch Trayah. 2. Pandit Lal Bahadurji Shastri has
published an article titled "What is the commentary self-known and its author
Yapaneya" in Jain Siddhant Bhaskar, Part 13, Kiran 1. It also sheds light on
this subject. 3. We will explain the nature of these in detail in the future, in
terms of their characteristics and regulations. 4. We will explain the bondage
that has been obtained. 5. "Bandha" is present. We will explain this further
above.

## Introduction  One of the Pattavalis (genealogical lists) compiled in the past
is the Dharmaghosha Suri Krit Dushma Kaal Shraman Sangh Stava. Its composition
is estimated to have taken place in the 13th century Vikram Samvat. In this, the
name of Umaswati comes after Haribhadra and Jinabhadra, but Haribhadra has
written a commentary on Umaswati's Tattvarthabhashya. These are scholars of the
8th-9th century Vikram Samvat, therefore, from the perspective of the
chronological order of the Acharyas, this Pattavali cannot be considered a
special proof. In this, the position of the commentator Umaswati in 720 Vikram
Samvat has been accepted.  The Tapa Gachchha Pattavali, compiled by Dharmasagar
Gani, was written in 1646 Vikram Samvat. In this, after mentioning Jinabhadra,
Vibhudh Prabha, Jayanand, and Raviprabha, the name of Umaswati is mentioned and
his time is stated as 720 Vikram Samvat. Although he has mentioned Umaswati as a
disciple of Balissah, one of the two disciples of Aryamahagiri, namely Bahul and
Balissah, and has considered the possibility of this first Umaswati being the
author of the Tattvarth Sutra. But this possibility of his is misleading.
Because in the 26th verse of the Nandisutra Pattavali, the word 'Hariyagatam
Savam' comes. In which there is a mention of Swati of the Harit Gotra. It seems
that Dharmasagar Gani, seeing the partial similarity in the name, has mistakenly
suspected him to be the author of the Tattvarth Sutra in the second place.
Pandit Sukhlalji has also declared this suspicion to be misleading.
Vinayavijaya Gani completed his Lokaprakash in 1708 Vikram Samvat. He considers
Umaswati to be a Yuga Pradhan Acharya and accepts his position between
Jinabhadra and Pushpamitra. He has not mentioned the time of Umaswati in his
Pattavali.  Ravivardhan Gani (1739 Vikram Samvat) has also mentioned Umaswati in
Pattavali Saroddhara. While mentioning the time in it, the actual time Veer Ni.
Samvat 1190 (Vikram Samvat 720) has been accepted.  These are the Pattavalis of
the Shwetambar tradition in which Umaswati is mentioned. Although these
Pattavalis are relatively modern and there are some differences in them, it is
not appropriate to consider them completely baseless. Based on the things
mentioned in them, the following facts are derived:  1. The commentator Umaswati
was a Yuga Pradhan Acharya. He lived around 720 Vikram Samvat. It is very likely
that for this reason, there is no mention of his tradition in the Nandisutra
Pattavali and the Kalpasutra Sthiravali.  2. Although Ravivardhan Gani has
mentioned the commentator Umaswati before Jinabhadra Gani, but from the point of
view of time, Ravivardhan Gani has stated him to be after Jinabhadra Gani,
therefore, considering the actual time accepted unanimously in all the above
Pattavalis, in the light of other evidence, it seems more likely that he lived
after Jinabhadra Gani.  3. A eulogy is also available at the end of the
Tattvarthabhashya in which the commentator Umaswati has called himself the
author of the Tattvarthadhigam Shastra. But since there is no mention of time
etc. in it, this eulogy seems to be only supplementary to the aforementioned
facts related to time.  We have already accepted this on the basis of many
proofs that the commentator Umaswati composed the Tattvarthabhashya and gave the
final form to the text of the Tattvarth Sutra accepted in the Tattvarthabhashya,
therefore, even after accepting these facts in this form, the commentator
Umaswati is the author of the original Tattvarth Sutra.  1. See their Tattvarth
Sutra introduction page 2. 2. All four Pattavalis are printed in the first part
of Shri Pattavali Samucchya edited by Muni Darshan Vijay.

## 10. Sarvarthasiddhi  It is not unreasonable to believe that the
Sarvarthasiddhi commentary on the Tattvarthasutra was written before the 8th
century Vikram era, perhaps in the early 6th century or even earlier, as many
commentaries and annotations were already in circulation.  Although
Dharmasagargani, a disciple of Balissah, doubts that Swati composed the
Tattvarthasutra, this is not his definitive opinion. It is merely a possibility.
As he states in his words, "Balissah's disciple Swati is considered to have
composed the Tattvartha and other works." Therefore, this cannot be given much
importance.  We have reviewed five opinions so far. Only one major opinion
remains, which needs to be considered from three perspectives: name, tradition,
and time.  We have already mentioned in the beginning, with citations, that
Acharya Virasen, Acharya Vidyānanda, and Acharya Vadiraj declare Acharya
Gṛddhapichchha as the author of the Tattvarthasutra. These mentions are
relatively ancient. However, apart from these mentions, all other mentions found
in the Digambara tradition show a variety of names, considering Gṛddhapichchha
as a secondary or another name. We have already mentioned some of these
prominent mentions under the heading "Other Opinions."  Similarly, there is a
prominent opinion based on the Nandisangh's lineage. Two lineages of Nandisangh
are available: one in Sanskrit and the other in Prakrit. The Sanskrit lineage
states that Acharya Umaswati is the author of the Tattvarthasutra.  Here, we
need to consider why there is so much disagreement about the author's name and
what his real name is.  We have already presented the citations from
inscriptions 105 and 108 found in Shravanabelagola. They are estimated to be
from the years 1320 and 1355 of the Saka era. Two other inscriptions from the
years 1037 and 1085 of the Saka era are also available there, which are listed
as numbers 47 and 40 in the Jain inscription collection, volume 1. Inscription
number 47 states:  "In the lineage of Shri Gautam Ganadhar, the prominent
Acharya Padmanandi of the Nandisangh, whose other name was Kondakunda, existed.
Then, in his lineage, Acharya Umaswati, whose other name was Gṛddhapichchha,
existed. His disciple was Balakapichchha, and Balakapichchha's disciple was
Gunanand."  Inscription number 40 states:  "After Gautam Ganadhar, the fifth
Shrutakevali, Bhadrabah, and his disciple Chandragupta existed. After them, in
their lineage, Padmanandi existed. His other name was Kondakunda. Then, in his
lineage, Acharya Gṛddhapichchha Umaswati existed. His disciple was
Balakapichchha. Thus, in the lineage of great Acharyas, Acharya Samantabhadra
existed."  Inscriptions 105 and 108, which we have already mentioned, say almost
the same thing. The only difference is that these two inscriptions mention
Gṛddhapichchha Umaswati as the author of the Tattvarthasutra, while inscriptions
47 and 40 do not mention him as the author.  Here, we want to present the
lineage based on the aforementioned mentions of the Digambara tradition, the
praise inscription found at the end of the Tattvarthabhashya, and the
Tapagachchha lineage written by Dharmasagargani. As follows:

## Introduction **Inscription (Chandragiri)** **Gautama Ganadhara**
**Tattvarthabhashya Pro. Vacakamukhya Shivashri** **Tapagachch Pattavali
Jinabhadragani** **Bhadrabahu (Anvayamen)** **Ghoshanandi Ksaman**
**Vibudhprabh** **Chandragupta (Shishya)** **Vacak Umaswati** **Jayanand**
**Padmanandi (Anvayamen)** **Raviprabh** **Gṛpiच्छ Umaswati (Anyayamen)**
**Umaswati** **Balakapiच्छ Shishya**  Thus, these three traditions are before
us. Regarding the Tapagachch Pattavali, it is only to be said that in the
presence of Dharmasagar Gani, while praising the Tattvarthabhashya, he mentioned
Umaswati along with the tradition of Tapagachch Acharyas. The reason for this is
only to accept Umaswati as a Yuga Pradhan Acharya along with his actual time.
The same is true for Jinabhadra Gani. Both of them are not the Acharyas of the
Tapagachch tradition, nor does Dharmasagar Gani believe so. This is the reason
why he has mentioned them only as Yuga Pradhan Acharyas while giving a separate
direction to the Tapagachch tradition. Therefore, leaving this and other praises
found with slight differences, two main traditions remain before us - one is the
tradition of inscriptions found in Shravanabelagola and the other is the
tradition of praise found at the end of the Tattvarthabhashya.  It is evident
from observation that not only are the Guruparamparas different in both these
mentions, but also their Upapadas or names are different. While the tradition of
inscriptions of Shravanabelagola declares the Tattvarthsutrakar as Gṛpiच्छ
Umaswati, the praise of Tattvarthabhashya addresses him as Vacak Umaswati.
Therefore, on these grounds, our belief is firm that Gṛpiच्छ Umaswati and Vacak
Umaswati must be different Acharyas.  _Thus, after proving these two Acharyas to
be different through this much discussion, it is to be seen here how much truth
is there in the name Gṛpiच्छ Umaswati, because we find many kinds of mentions
regarding this name. Sometimes he is called only Gṛpiच्छ and sometimes he is
called Umaswami or Umaswati with the Upapada Gṛddhpiच्छ. Sometimes Gṛddhpiच्छ is
said to be another name of Umaswati, and sometimes only the name Umaswati comes.
Although these names seem different at first glance, like the name Umaswami is
different from Umaswati. It can be said here that one of these names must have
been there first and later 'm' in the place of 'n'._  1. In the context of the
description of Anvayavali in Jinendra Kalyanaabhyudaya, there is a verse in
which both Kundakunda Acharya and Umaswati are called Vacak. And by looking at
the last part of the Dhavala Tika, it is also known that the Upapada 'Vacak' was
used in the Digambar tradition. But the evidence of Jinendra Kalyanaabhyudaya is
relatively very recent and on this basis alone, Vacak Umaswati of
Tattvarthabhashya and Gṛpiच्छ Umaswati of Shravanabelagola inscriptions cannot
be considered one. See the letter of Pandit Jugalkishorji Mukhtar quoted in the
appendix of the introduction of Tattvarthsutra by Pandit Sukhlalji.

## Sarvarthasiddhi  The names might have come into circulation because 'm' was
written in place of 't' or 't'. Similarly, the mention of a Gṛddhapiṭṭha named
Umāsvāti or Umāsvābhī somewhere with the other Nāga, and the mention of one of
them somewhere else, suggests that there was a tradition of writing complete or
incomplete names, and it is possible that these names came to be mentioned in
various ways according to that tradition.  We accept the truth of these
arguments. However, the question is how did a single scripture come to be
associated with both an Ācārya Nandiśaṅgha and Kundakunda, who belonged to
different traditions and lived at different times? It is not possible to say
that the commentator Umāsvāti of the Śvetāmbara tradition saw this name and
adopted it as his own, because the Pattavalis and other evidence show that
Gṛddhapiṭṭha came after Ācārya Kundakunda, while the commentator Umāsvāti lived
much later. It is also not possible to say that Gṛddhapiṭṭha Umāsvāti saw this
name and adopted it as his own, because the eulogy at the end of the
Tattvārthabhāṣya gives the reason for the commentator Umāsvāti's name. It states
that his father's name was 'Svāti', and Siddhasena Gaṇini, while explaining this
eulogy, also writes that his mother's name was 'Umā'. Therefore, his name is
Umāsvāti. It cannot be said that this eulogy was fabricated later, because the
commentator Siddhasena Gaṇini not only mentions it but also explains it, thereby
making it a part of the Tattvārthabhāṣya. In this regard, we agree with the
opinion of Paṇḍit Sukhlālji that this is the work of the commentator Umāsvāti
himself.  In this context, we would like to point out that most scholars, when
they do not find their opinion supported by a eulogy, Pattavali, inscription,
etc., declare it to be completely unauthentic or forged. However, this tendency
cannot be called thoughtful. Because in ancient times, the means of compiling
history were often limited. Most historians had to rely on storytellers, and
they recorded what they knew from authentic sources. Therefore, it is possible
that a name, time, or event may have been recorded correctly in one inscription,
etc., and in another inscription, etc., it may have been recorded in a corrupted
form. However, it is certain that, except for mentions made out of sectarian
bias, the intention of the recorder was not to deliberately corrupt it. The
famous author of the Dhavala commentary, Ācārya Vīrasena, has presented a very
good line of thought in this regard. He received one opinion that the age of
Bhagavān Mahāvīra was 72 years, and another opinion that the age of Bhagavān
Mahāvīra was 71 years, 3 months, and 25 days. Therefore, he was faced with the
question of which one to consider as evidence? In response to this question,
what he writes is not only heart-touching but also worthy of emulation. He says,
"I, Vīrasena, the disciple of the Ācārya, do not open my mouth on the subject of
which of these two is right and which is wrong, because there is no obstacle to
accepting either of them. But one of these two must be correct, so one should
find it and state it."  1. 'Kauvhiṣaṇinā Svātitanayena-'. 2. Vātsīsute neti

---------------------------
## Introduction  While it is appropriate to give prominence to what appears
correct based on proper grounds, it is not right to attempt to declare one as
completely false and the other as completely true.  This relevant statement
makes it clear that the inscriptions and quotations found in the Digambara
tradition regarding the Tattvartha Sutra are also ordinary, and the mentions
found in the Svetambara tradition are also ordinary. Therefore, it is not our
task to declare one authentic and the other inauthentic, but only to clarify
their position in the light of other evidence. And in carrying out this task,
based on the facts expressed at various places in the introduction, we have
reached the conclusion that the name of the author of the Tattvarthaadhigama
Shastra in the Svetambara tradition is indeed Vaachka Umaswati, but those who
initially composed the Tattvartha Sutra and who belonged to the Acharya
Kundakunda tradition, their name is not Giddhapiccha Umaswati, Grippiccha
Umaswami, Umaswati or Umaswami, but simply Giddhapicchaacharya.  The mentions
that express the fact that the author of the Tattvartha Sutra is
Giddhapicchaacharya are from the 9th century. And around the same time, this
belief seems to have become prevalent in the Svetambara tradition as well, as is
evident from some questionable mentions of Siddhasena Ganika, that the author of
the Tattvarthabhashya, Vaachka Umaswati, is also the author of the Tattvartha
Sutra. Therefore, it appears that these two beliefs together gave birth to a new
belief, and in later times, Giddhapiccha and Umaswati, these two independent
names of two Acharyas, merged into one name, and later on, the author of the
Tattvartha Sutra came to be referred to as Giddhapiccha Umaswati. This is the
reason why we see the use of these names or the name Umaswati with Grippiccha as
a suffix for one Acharya in the inscriptions of Shravanabelgola or elsewhere.
This view that the author of the Tattvartha Sutra should be Giddhapicchaacharya
and Vaachka Umaswati is different from him, can be expressed briefly by these
facts:  1. The association of Acharya Giddhapiccha's name with the composition
of the Tattvartha Sutra cannot be without reason. 2. Acharya Vira Sena,
Vidyānanda and Vadiraj have expressed the name of the author of the Tattvartha
Sutra as Giddhapicchaacharya, and these mentions are older than other evidence.
3. In the Svetambara tradition, the name of the Acharya who authored the
Tattvarthabhashya is Vaachka Umaswati, not Giddhapiccha Umaswati. Therefore, it
appears that the name Giddhapiccha Umaswati is a combination of the two names
Giddhapiccha and Umaswati. 4. Giddhapicchaacharya belonged to the lineage of
Acharya Kundakunda, and the lineage of Umaswati is different, therefore, they
must be two independent Acharyas, not one. 5. There is a big difference in the
time of existence of both Giddhapicchaacharya and Vaachka Umaswati, therefore,
they cannot be one.  ## Tradition  Based on the above decision regarding the
name, much of the controversy regarding which tradition the author of the
Tattvartha Sutra belonged to is resolved, because based on the evidence that
establishes his name as Acharya Giddhapiccha, he is only a Digambara. Whether he
was a direct disciple of Acharya Kundakunda or not, he belonged to his lineage,
this is proven by the lineage mentioned earlier and other evidence. This verse
appears in the Panchaastikaya of Acharya Kundakunda:  1. Jayadhwala Book 1 Page

74 Sarvarthasiddhi "We are those who are born, exist, and perish, and are united
with the characteristics of the soul. They are the beings who are truly
righteous, or they are those who are united with the characteristics of the
soul." Now, in the light of this verse, see these sutras from the
Tattvarthasutra: Sad dravyalakshanam || 5, 29 || Utpadavyaya shrivyayuktam sat
|| 5, 30 || Gunaparyayavad dravyam || 5, 30 || There are many such sayings in
which the use of words like "nathaya" has been made in the sayings of Acharya
Kundakunda and in the Tattvarthasutra. Apart from this, there is also a verbal
and objective similarity in the principles, which proves that its author belongs
to the Digambara tradition. The question of the time of Acharya Guddhapichcha,
who is known by the same name as time, is also very much worth considering.
Generally, the mention of days sheds direct light on their time. There are two
such mentions before us. First, the mention of the Nandisangh's lineage, and
second, the mention of their time quoted in the Vajan Bodhak. 1. The
Nandisangh's lineage begins with the coronation of Vikrama, and it is quoted in
the form in which it is quoted in Jain Siddhanta Bhaskar Kiran, 4, p. 78, based
on Indian Antiquary, its initial part is as follows: "Bhadrabahu II (4) 2
Guptigupta (26) 3 Mamnandi (36) 4 Jinachand (40) 5 Kundakunda Acharya (49) 6
Umaswami (101) 7 Lohacharya (142) 8 Yash: Kirti (153) 9 Yashonandi (211) 10
Devanandi (258) 11 Jayanandi (308) 12 Gunanandi (358) 13 Vajranandi (364) 14
Kumaranandi (386) 15 Lokachand (427) 16 Prabhachandra (453) 17 Nemichandra (478)
18 Bhanunandi (487) 19 Hinndi (508) 20 Shri Vasunandi (525) 21 Viranandi (531)
22 Ratnanandi (561) 23 Manikyanandi (585) 24 Meghchandra (601) 25 Shantikirti
(627) 26 Merukiti (642)." Guptigupta is the second name of Aham Balika. He was
the first Pattadhar Acharya of the Nandisangh, which he established along with
other sanghs. According to this, Umaswami (Guddhapichcha) is the fourth Acharya
to sit on the throne of the Nandisangh. Although they are mentioned at number 6
in the lineage, the count of the Acharyas of the Nandisangh should be done only
after excluding Bhadrabahu II and Adbalika. Therefore, we have mentioned the
number of Umaswami (Pichcha) as 4. According to this lineage, he lived in 571
VE. 2. This verse is quoted in the Vidvajjan Bodhak: "Varshasaptashatechaiva
saptatyacha vismritau | Umaswamimunirmaatah Kundakundastatheva cha ||" This
means that Umaswami Muni lived in 770 VE, and at the same time, Acharya
Kundakunda Now let us see other evidence. 1. In the Shrutavatar of Indranandi,
the lineage of the Shruta Dhar Acharyas for the first 683 years is given. And
after this, the names of Vinamdhara Shridatta and Arhat, who were one-part
holders of Angapurva, are mentioned, and the establishment of the Nandisangh and
other sanghs is mentioned. 1. See Tattvarthasutra, A. 9, S. 9 || 2.
Shubhachandra, the author of the Pandavapurana, has given his lineage. In it
too, this order is accepted up to 10 Acharyas. And even further, except for one
or two names, there is similarity in the names of the Acharyas. They declare
themselves to be of the Nandisangh. See Janasiddhanta Bhaskar, Part 1, Kiran 4,
p. 51.

## Introduction  The name of the author of the Ahelika is mentioned, followed by
Maghanandi, Earsen Pushpadanta, and Bhootbalika. After this, the name of Acharya
Kundakunda appears in the Acharya tradition. It is certain that Acharya
Ddhipichchh came after Acharya Kundakunda. Therefore, if we consider this and
add approximately 100 years for the Acharyas who came in the 683 years of the
Shruthdhara Acharyas, then it can be said that Ddhipichchh lived around 783
years after the Veer Ni. Sa.  ## Acharya  2. In the inscription number 105 of
Shravanabelagola, the tradition of the Bhog Ghar Anayaki is mentioned, followed
by the names of Kumbh, Vineet, Haldhar Vasudev, Achal, Merudheer, Sarvash,
Sarvagupt, Mahidhar, Dhanpal, Mahavir, and Veer. After this, the name of
Kundakunda and the author of the Tattvarth Sutra, Umashwatika, appears. However,
this inscription does not mention the time period of the Bhootdhara Acharyas.
Secondly, it does not consider the names of the Shruthdhara and other Acharyas.
Therefore, nothing can be inferred about the time of the Acharya Ddhipichchh
based on this inscription.  3. The tradition of the Shruthdhara Acharyas is also
mentioned in the Dharna, Adipurana, the Prakrit Pattavali of the Nandisangha,
and the Trilokpragyapti. However, they are limited to mentioning the 683-year
tradition. Therefore, it is difficult to reach any conclusion based on these
sources. Based on these sources, it cannot be said what the opinion of these
Acharyas is regarding the time of Acharya Grichchh. Without knowing their
opinion in this regard, we are not ready to accept the position of Acharya
Ddhipichchh after the 683-year tradition of the Shruthdharis based solely on the
Shrutavatar of Indranandi, according to the opinion of these Acharyas.  Thus,
from the above discussion, three main opinions emerge, which provide information
about the time of Acharya Sachchhik. Firstly, according to the Pattavali of the
Nandisangha, his time is Vikrama (571-470) 101. Secondly, according to the verse
quoted by the scholars Bodhak, his time is Vikrama (770-470) 300. And thirdly,
according to the Thutavatar of Dandranandi, it can be estimated as Vikrama
(783-470) 313.  In the inscriptions of Shravanabelagola, the name of Acharya
Balakapichchh appears as the successor of Acharya Vrudhhipichchh. And this is
the solution that has been accepted. In the Sindhi Pattavali, the name of
Lohaacharya appears in place of Balakapichchh. However, it is possible that the
Pattavali mentions the names of those Acharyas who came after them. It is
possible that the Pattavali mentions the names of their prominent disciples.
Even if we accept this Pattavali as correct, the difference between the time
mentioned in the Pattavali and the time mentioned in other sources regarding
their time is a matter of consideration.  Here, we will not delve into the
opinions of other Eastern and Western scholars, as they have mostly based their
opinions on the Tattvarth Sutra and the Tattvarth Bhashya. However, we would
like to present the opinion of Dr. A.N. Upadhye, which is a well-considered
opinion. After much deliberation, he has stated his opinion regarding the time
of Acharya Kundakunda. However, according to the Nandisangha Pattavali and other
evidence, Acharya Gudhpihchchh was a disciple of Acharya Kundakunda. Therefore,

## 76 **Sarvarthasiddhi**  Light is shed on all aspects of the time period.
After considering all the opinions and views of scholars, the conclusion they
have reached is:  "After such a long discussion, we arrive at the fact that,
according to tradition, the time period of Acharya Kundakunda falls between the
middle of the 1st century BCE and the middle of the 1st century CE. The
Shatkhandagama was written before the middle of the 2nd century CE, so from this
perspective, his time period falls around the middle of the 2nd century CE.
According to the Tamrapatra of Merkara, the final limit of Acharya Kundakunda
can be considered to be before the middle of the 3rd century CE. Along with
this, he was perhaps contemporary with King Shivascanda and the author of Kural.
This suggests that Acharya Kundakunda lived in the first two centuries mentioned
above. Considering all of this, I have reached the conclusion that Kundakunda
lived in the 1st century CE."  This is the fact that Dr. A.N. Upadhye has stated
regarding the time of Acharya Kundakunda. The time limit mentioned in the
Nandisingha Pattavali is almost the same, so considering all these bases, it can
be said that Acharya Gṛddhapichcha must have lived after Acharya Kundakunda, who
lived in the 1st century CE, because his name appears after Acharya Kundakunda
in the Pattavalis and other inscriptions, and it is possible that there was a
Guru-Shishya relationship between the two. It is clear from the Nandisingha
Pattavali that he is the successor of Acharya Kundakunda.  5. **The reason for
the creation of the Tattvarthasutra:** It is a well-known story in the world
that a certain Bhavya, considering the creation of a scripture useful for the
path of liberation, wrote the sutra "Darshanashancharitrani Mokshamārgaḥ" on a
wall. After that, he went out for work, and Gṛddhapichcha Acharya came there for
his daily routine. Seeing the sutra written on the wall incomplete, he added the
word "Samyak" at the beginning. When that Bhavya returned from outside and saw
the word "Samyak" added at the beginning of the sutra, he was surprised. He
asked the members of his household about the reason, and knowing the true
reason, he went searching for Gṛddhapichcha Acharya and expressed his opinion to
him, requesting him to write the scripture. Accordingly, the Acharya Maharaj
composed the Tattvarthasutra.  Here, we need to see how this story became
prevalent in the world. Is there any reliable basis for its authenticity, or is
it merely the emotional outburst of devotees inspired by pure sentimentality?
This fact is considered in detail further.  1. Shruta Sagar Suri has written in
the beginning of his Tattvarthavritti that once Acharya Umaswami (Gṛddhapichcha)
was sitting in his ashram. At that time, a Bhavya named Dvaiyak came there and
asked him, "O Bhagavan! What is beneficial for us?" Upon the Bhavya asking this
question, the Acharya replied auspiciously, "Moksha." Hearing this, Dvaiyak
asked again, "What is its nature, and what is the means of attaining it?" In
response, he explained the nature of Moksha, saying that although the nature of
Moksha is like this, people who are prone to delusion perceive it in a different
way. Not only that, but they also argue about its path. Some consider knowledge
without conduct to be the path to liberation, some consider mere faith to be the
path to liberation, and some consider conduct without knowledge to be the path
to liberation.  1. Based on the preface of Pravachansara, page 22. 2. The basis
of this story is known from the Kannada commentary on the Tattvarthasutra
written by Balachandra Muni in the 13th century. In it, the name of the Shravaka
is given as Siddhayya. See the preface of the Tattvarthasutra by Pandit
Kailashchandraji, page 16.

## Introduction  The path to liberation (moksha) is considered to be the
ultimate goal. However, just as a disease cannot be cured by mere knowledge,
observation, or application of medicine, liberation cannot be attained by mere
faith, knowledge, or conduct alone. When a devotee (bhavya) asked how liberation
could be attained, the Acharya (teacher) responded with the sutra (aphorism):
"Samyagdarshanashanacharitrani mokshamarghah" (Right faith, right knowledge, and
right conduct are the path to liberation). This sutra became the foundation for
the Tattvarth Sutra.  ## The Origin of the Tattvarth Sutra  The same
introductory verse is found in both the Sarvarthasiddhi and the
Tattvarthavartika. Shruta Sagar Suri adopted this verse from the
Sarvarthasiddhi. The only difference is that the devotee who approached the
Acharya is referred to as "Kachid Bhavya" in the Sarvarthasiddhi, while Shruta
Sagar Suri mentions his name. It is unclear from what sources he obtained this
name.  These references from renowned commentaries on the Tattvarth Sutra
support the popular belief that the Tattvarth Sutra was composed at the request
of a devotee. However, it is unknown whether the devotee first composed the
sutra "Darshanajnanacharitrani" and later, at the devotee's request, the
sutrakar (author of the sutra) revised it into the Tattvarth Sutra. Therefore,
while these references do not fully support the entire story, they do provide
some basis for believing it to be partially true.  ## Acharya Pujyapada  Acharya
Pujyapada is a prominent figure in the great Indian tradition of Tattvadrashta
(those who have realized the truth) scholars. He was blessed with both
brilliance and scholarship. In the Jain tradition, after Acharya Samantabhadra
and Acharya Siddhasena, the author of Sanmati, if anyone can be placed on a high
pedestal in the literary world, it is Acharya Pujyapada. The influence of his
literary legacy is evident in both the Digambara and Svetambara traditions. This
is why many later writers and historians have acknowledged his importance,
scholarship, and versatility, offering him their reverence.  Acharya Jinesena,
the author of the Adi Purana, considers him a Tirthankara (liberated being)
among poets and praises him, saying:  "Kavinaam Tirthakadevah Kintaram Tatra
Varnate | Vidushan Vaangmaladhvansi Ti Yasy Vachomaya ||1,52||"  Who can praise
Devnandi Acharya, who was like a Tirthankara among poets and whose words, like a
holy pilgrimage, cleanse the impurities of the words of scholars?  We will
discuss later how he illuminated the path to liberation through his unparalleled
works. He also contributed to the field of linguistics. It is even said that he
explored the subject of anatomy, a field of practical use to society. This is
why Acharya Shubhachandra, the author of Gyanarnava, acknowledges his qualities,
saying:  "Apakuर्वन्ति यहाचः कायवाञ्चित्तसम्भवम् ।। Kalamaninaam So'yam
Devanandi Mamasyate ||1,15||"  I bow to Devnandi Acharya, whose teachings are
capable of removing all impurities from the body, speech, and mind of beings.
Acharya Gunanandi, relying on his grammatical sutras, composed the Jainendra
Prakriya. He begins his work with a salutation:  "Mamah Bhi Pujyapadaaya
Lakshanam Yapakam | Yadevaatra Tabanyatra Pamnaanasti Na Tattvchit ||"  My
salutations to Pujyapada, whose teachings are comprehensive. Whatever is found
here is also found elsewhere, and whatever is not found here is not true.

## 18 **Sarvartha Siddhi**  I bow to the revered Acharya Pujyapada, the author
of the Lakshanashastra. The importance of this Lakshanashastra is evident from
the fact that whatever is contained in it is found elsewhere, and whatever is
not in it is not found elsewhere.  The tradition of praising him and his
literature is not uniform. There have been many Acharyas like Dhananjaya,
Vadiraja, Bhattaraka Shubhachandra, and Padma Prabha, who have followed in the
footsteps of their predecessors to preserve this tradition of the Muni. The
implication is that Acharya Pujyapada was a radiant sun in the world of
literature, who would never perish, and whose rays would illuminate all
directions forever.  These are the Acharya Pujyapada, the author of the present
commentary on the Tattvarthasutra, Sarvartha Siddhi, whose complete introduction
we have to obtain here. In it, we need to consider his full name, the sect he
was the head of, his life history, his works, and his real work, and the guru-
shishya tradition, etc. We will begin by introducing these topics one by one.
First, let's take the name.  2. It is known from the inscriptions and other
evidence that his initiation name given by his guru was Devanandi. Due to his
sharp intellect, he was called Jinendra Buddhi, and his feet were worshipped by
the gods, so he was also known in the world as Pujyapada. The following are the
quotations that express this meaning:  > "Praagabhyadhaayi gurunaa kil vanandi
buddhya punavipulyaa sa minendrabuddhih. Shree pujyapaada iti cha sha budhai:
prachalye satyamita pavayuge vanadevataabhih."  > (Shravanabelagola Shi. No.
105, Vi. Sa. 13201)  See another inscription No. 108 from the same place, which
expresses the significance of the names Pujyapada and Jinendra Buddhi:  >
"Shreepaadodakshtadharmarajyastatah suraabishwarapujyapaadah.
Yadiyadrushyagunaanivani badanti shaastrani tadashtaani."  >
"Putavishvabuddhirayamatrayogihibh krta krtyabhava manavibhrayucchakai. Jinayad
babhuva yavanangachapahrits jinendrabudsiriti saavarnitah."  > (Both these
verses are from the inscription of Vi. Sa. 1355.)  These verses state that
Acharya Pujyapada had saved the Dharma Rajya, and his feet were worshipped by
the Indras. This is the reason why he was addressed as Pujyapada. He possessed
many qualities like scholarship, etc., which are still being established by the
scriptures written by him. He was a holder of universal knowledge like the Jina
Deva, was accomplished, and had conquered Kamadeva, so the yogis addressed him
by the name Jinendra Buddhi.  Many such proofs are available in inscriptions and
elsewhere, which prove the significance of his three names.  We have already
mentioned the Adipurana. From a mention of him and Vadiraja, it is known...  1.
This fact is also supported by an inscription No. 1085 from Shravanabelagola
(which is earlier than this). 2. See Shravanabelagola inscription No. 50 and the
lineage of the Nandi Sangha. 3. Parsvanathacharita Sarga 1, verse 181.

## Introduction 79 It is said that they also had a name 'Dev'. It seems that
their initiation name was 'Devanandi', and the mentioned Acharyas have used
'Dev' as a shortened form of this name. Therefore, this is not an independent
name, but appears to be a shortened form of the name 'Devanandi'. 3 The history
of the origin of the Sanghas (groups) has been given by Indranandi in his
Shrutavatar. He writes that when one hundred Yojanas of Munis (ascetics)
gathered together, under the supervision of Acharya Ahmbali, who was
knowledgeable in the eight limbs of conduct and followed the pure practices of
Dharana (concentration) and Prasarana (expansion), and were performing the
Yugapratkram (cycle of time), at the end of the Yuga, while performing the
Yugapratkram, Acharya Arhadbali asked the assembled Munis if all the Yatis
(ascetics) had arrived. The Yatis replied that they had arrived with their
respective Sanghas. Hearing this reply, he realized that this was the Kali Yuga
(dark age). In this age, the Yatis would be divided by factions, and would not
remain in a state of equanimity. With this thought, he gave the name 'Nandi' to
some of those who had come from the cave, and 'Veer' to others. He gave the name
'Aparajit' to some of those who had come from the Ashoka Vatika (garden), and
'Dev' to others. He gave the name 'Sen' to some of those who had come from the
Panchastupa (five mounds), and 'Bhadra' to others. He gave the name 'Ghandhar'
to some of those who had come from the Shalmali Mahadrum (tree), and 'Gupt' to
others. He gave the name 'Singh' to some of those who had come from the root of
the Khandakesar tree, and 'Chandra' to others. This shows that the original
Sanghas, which were previously united and free from divisions of Sanghas and
Ganas (groups), became divided into many parts. This is the story of the origin
of the various Sanghas. Now, let us look at the lineage of the Nandi Sanghas,
which is mentioned here. Shubhachandracharya, in his Pandav Purana, while
mentioning his Guru lineage, writes: Shrimaalsandhe'jani Nanvisanghastasmim
Balaatkaargano'tiramyah. Tatrabhavatpurvapadaamshaveedi Shrimaadhanandi
Naradevavandhah. ||2|| This states that the Nandi Sanghas are a part of the
Balaatkaar Gana, which is a part of the original Sanghas. In this lineage, there
was Acharya Maghanandi, who was knowledgeable in the earlier scriptures and was
revered by both humans and gods. After this, the lineage mentions the names of 4
Jinachandra, 5 Padmanandi (according to this lineage, Padmanandi had four other
names - Kundakunda, Vakragriva, Elacharya and Gaddhaprichch), 6 Umaswati, the
author of the Tattvarth Sutra, 7 Lohacharya, 8 Yash:kiiti, 9 Yashonandi and 10
Devanandi. All these names are found in the lineage of the Nandi Sanghas in the
same order. Further, in this lineage, after 11 Gunanandi, the name of 12
Vachanandi appears. However, in the lineage of the Nandi Sanghas, after 11
Jayanandi and 12 Gunanandi, the name of 13 Vajanandi appears. _ Although the
lineage of both of them is almost similar after this, we are not mentioning it
here as it is not relevant to the present context. In this context, we only need
to mention that Acharya Pujyapada was the head of the Nandi Sanghas, which is a
part of the Balaatkaar Gana, which is a part of the original Sanghas. It is also
known from other sources that his Gachchha (lineage) was known as 'Saraswati'.
It is also known from this that our famous Acharyas Kundakunda and
Giddhaprichchha (Umaswati) were the predecessors in this lineage. 4. Life Sketch

lineage did he belong? . See Jain Siddhanta Bhaskara Part 1, Kiran 4, Page 51.

##  80 **Sarvarthasiddhi**  The introduction to all these matters was given by
Shriman Pt. Nathuramji Premi in his book "Devanandi and his Jainendra Vyakaran".
He wrote this introduction based on the "Poojyapad Charite" written in the
Kanati language. The author of this book was the poet "Chandrasya". It is also
known from the writings of Shriman Pt. Jugalkishorji Mukhtar that this biography
is also mentioned in the "Rajavali". However, it is not clear how much truth and
discrepancy there is in both of these. In the words of Premiji, the story is as
follows:  1. Poojyapad was born to a Brahmin named Madhav Bhatt and his wife
Shridevi Brahmani in a village called "Kole" in the Karnataka country.
Astrologers declared the child to be "Trilok Poojya". Therefore, he was named
Poojyapad. Madhav Bhatt accepted Jainism at the behest of his wife. His brother-
in-law's name was "Panini". He also asked him to become a Jain. But due to the
concern of reputation, he did not become a Jain and became a Vaishnavite ascetic
in the village of Mudikuṇḍ. Poojyapad had a younger sister named Kamalini, who
was married to Gunabhatt, and they had a son named Nagarjun.  Poojyapad saw a
frog trapped in the mouth of a snake in a garden. This made him renounce the
world and he became a Jain monk.  Panini was composing his grammar. He had not
finished it when he realized his death was near. Knowing this, he asked
Poojyapad to complete it. He agreed to do so.  Panini died due to carelessness
and became a snake. Once he saw Poojyapad and hissed at him. Poojyapad said,
"Have faith, I will complete your grammar." After this, he completed the Panini
Vyakaran.  Before this, he had already written many books like Jainendra
Vyakaran, Arhaspratisthalakshan, and Vaidak Jyotish. After Gun's death, Nagarjun
became extremely poor. Poojyapad gave him a mantra of Padmavati and also told
him the method of making it effective. Under its influence, Padmavati appeared
before Nagarjun and showed him the plant of Siddharas.  With this Siddhir,
Nagarjun started making gold. To remove his pride, Poojyapad made many pots of
Siddharam in a simple plant. Nagarjun started making the Jay mountains golden,
then Dharanendra Padmavati stopped him and asked him to build a Jinalaya.
Accordingly, he built a Jinalaya and installed the statue of Parshvanath.
Poojyapad used to go to the Videha region by applying a celestial ointment on
his feet. At that time, his disciple Vachananvi established the Bi Sangha by
quarreling with his companions.  Nagarjun became very famous by performing many
mantras, tantras, and rasasiddhis. Once two beautiful women came who were
skilled in dancing. Nagarjun was captivated by them. They stayed there and after
some time, they left with his Rasagutika.  In the song:  Poojyapad Muni
practiced yoga for a long time. Then he boarded a divine chariot and traveled to
many pilgrimages. On the way, his eyesight was lost, so he created a Shanti
Ashtak and recited it. After this, he returned to his village and died
peacefully.  Shri Motichandra Gautamchandra Kothari Faltonwal has edited another
version of Sarvarthasiddhi, which was published from Solapur. In it, he has
given some suggestions and discussed the grammar of this story.  1. See Jain
Literature and History, p. 123. 2. See the introduction of Ratnakaranḍak.

## Introduction  An attempt has been made to establish the authenticity of the
account. However, as other facts prove, the author of the Panini grammar, Panini
Rishi, lived long before Pujyapada. Not only this, the Varttika of Katyayana and
the Mahabhashya of Patanjali on Panini grammar, which are famous, were also
written many centuries before Pujyapada. Therefore, it cannot be said on the
basis of this story alone that Acharya Pujyapada lived during the time of Panini
and completed his incomplete grammar. The story mentions many other events that
can be called exaggerated. But one thing is clear that Acharya Pujyapada was a
connoisseur of Panini grammar, its Varttika and Mahabhashya. This suggests that
he may have been born in a Brahmin family and may have been a follower of
another religion in the early part of his life. Therefore, the introduction of
his father, mother, and family in this story may also be correct. Whatever may
be the case, we can say from this story that Pujyapada was born in a Brahmin
family. His father's name was Madhav Bhatt and his mother's name was Shridevi.
They were residents of a village called 'Kole' and his birth name was Pujyapada.
He did not marry and embraced Jainism in his childhood. Later, he saw a frog
struggling in the mouth of a snake and took Muni Diksha. During his lifetime, he
traveled to the Videha region many times due to the influence of the Gaganagami
Lep. Based on an inscription at Shravanabelagola, it can also be said that the
water used to wash his feet turned iron into gold. The story writer has also
mentioned that the dust sanctified by his touch had the power to turn stone into
gold. Once, while on a pilgrimage, his vision became clouded. He overcame this
by composing the Shanti Ashtak. But this incident had such an impact on him that
he returned from the pilgrimage and took Samadhi.  ## Self-composed Literature
The following is a brief introduction to the literature that Acharya Pujyapada
composed during his lifetime, including the Sarvarthasiddhi:  1.
**Sarvarthasiddhi:** We have already given a detailed introduction to this.  2.
**Samaashitantra:** This contains a total of 105 verses. The subject is
spirituality. The name of the text is Samadhitantra. Acharya Pujyapada himself
has given this information in the last verse of the text. One inscription from
Shravanabelagola, dated Saka Samvat 1085, mentions it as Samadhishatak in
inscription number 40. Secondly, the first bunch printed from Banaras also
contains this with commentary and at the end, a praise verse is quoted in which
its name is mentioned as Samadhishatak in a play on words. It seems that due to
these reasons, its other name Samadhishatak became famous.  Although this text
is an independent work of Acharya Pujyapada, an internal examination reveals
that he composed it after assimilating the Agam created by Acharya Kundakunda.
For example, this verse appears in the Niyamsar:  > णियभावंण विमुंच परभावं व
गिण्हए केई। > जाणवि पस्सदि सव्वं सोहं इदि चितए जाणी।।97॥  Now compare this with
this verse from Samadhitantra:  > यवपाह्यं न गृह्णाति गृहीतं नापि मुञ्चति ।
जानाति सर्वथा सर्व तत्स्वसंवेद्यमस्म्यहम् ॥30॥  1.
'श्रीपूज्यपादमुनिरप्रतिभौषद्धिजीयाद्विदेहजिनदर्शनपूतगात्रः।
यत्पादधौतजलसंस्पर्शप्रभावाकालायसं किल तदा कनकीचकार ॥' Inscription 108 (Saka
Samvat 1355).  2. See Introduction, page 23.

## Sarvarthasiddhi  If one observes closely, it becomes evident that the
**Mokshapraabhrut** was the guiding light for its creation, and almost all its
content has been accepted. The first verse of the **Praabhrut** is:  82
**Gaanamayan appaanam uvalayam jena jhadiyakkamena. Chauna va paravavyam namo
namo tassa devassa. || 1 ||**  Now, in its light, look at the first auspicious
verse of the **Samadhitantra**:  **Yenatmayatmaeva paratvenamva chaparam.
Akshyaanantayoshaya tasme siddhaatmane namah. || 1 ||**  Now, take another verse
from the **Mokshapraabhrut**:  **Jam maya disave ruupam tam na jaanadhi sambhaha
jago vissade na sam samha jampemi kena ham. ||**  The same subject is expressed
in the **Samadhitantra** in exactly the same words:  **Yanmaya drishyathe ruupam
Tan na jaanathi sarvatha. Jaanan drishyathe ruupam tatah kena braviamy aham. ||
18 ||**  Not only this, but it is clear from observation that during the writing
of the **Samadhitantra**, **Acharya Kundakunda's** **Samayapraabhrut** was also
present before **Acharya Pujyapada**. **Acharya Kundakunda**, while explaining
that internal transformations are essential and external signs alone are not
sufficient for the path of liberation, said in the **Samayapraabhrut**:
**Paadilanganni va miliganni va bahupyawaraani. Vitum vadanti moodha sigaminam
mokyam aggo ti. || 408 ||** **Ma u hodi momo lingam jam dehanimmama ariha.
Lingam muddatu dansonanaacharitaani seyanthi. || 409 ||**  The same fact is
expressed by **Acharya Pujyapada** in the **Samadhitantra** in these words:
**Ling vehaashritam drishtam vah evam aatmano bhavah. Na muchyathe
bhavatasmaalay ye lingakrutaagrahaah. ||** **Jati vehaathita drishta deha eva
aatmano bhavah. Na muchyanthe bhavatasmasase ye jatikrtaagrahaah. ||**  There is
no doubt that this path of liberation is like a guiding light for those seekers
who are eager to engage in their self-work. It explains in simple and heart-
touching poetry how the soul, through the three distinctions of external self,
internal self, and supreme self, attains the supreme self by abandoning the
external self and becoming the internal self.  **Istopadesh** has a total of 51
verses. The subject matter is self-awareness, and the name of the text,
**Istopadesh**, is mentioned by **Acharya Pujyapada** himself in its final
verse.  While creating this work, **Acharya Pujyapada** had only one vision: to
help the worldly soul recognize its true nature and, instead of considering the
body, senses, and their actions as its own, to strive to be mindful of its self-
work. While studying the **Samayapraabhrut**, we witness this sentiment on every
step, and therefore we can say that it was created by assimilating the subject
matter of the **Samayapraabhrut** and other works. For comparison, see...

## Introduction  This is my humble offering, a collection of teachings on the
path of liberation. These are my external thoughts, arising from the interaction
of the soul with the world.   - I am one, existing in the present moment, free
from attachment, pure, knowledgeable, and the object of the yogi's aspiration.
All external thoughts, arising from interaction with the world, are completely
different from me. (27)  - The soul, bound by karmic actions, is liberated from
them through detachment. This is the path of the Jina, therefore, do not be
attached to karmic actions. (26)  - The *Iṣṭopadesa* (a collection of teachings)
contains a verse that states that even a pot can become a god through the
influence of Dharma, and a god can become a pot through the influence of
Adharma. As it is said:  > Even a god or a pot can be born from the poison of
attachment. > The wealth of liberation is attained by those who are righteous.
(1, 29)  - While these exact words are not found in the *Iṣṭopadesa*, the
Acharya (spiritual teacher) says, following the same principle:  > Better to be
a vow-taker than a hell-dweller. > The sun and the moon protect us. (3)  - This
is a great help for the seeker in their spiritual practice.  - There are more
than ten types of devotion, but they are primarily considered to be ten. Shriman
Pandit Pannalalji Soni has compiled and published a book called *Kriyakalāpa*.
This is a collection of texts. Panditji himself has compiled some of the
chapters in the first chapter. The rest of the collection seems to be ancient.
It is possible that the compiler was Pandit Prabhācandra. He has also written
commentaries on many useful topics in this collection. He was a scholar and his
name was Prabhācandra - this information was given by him himself while writing
the concluding verse of the chapter on Nandīśvara-bhakti! - It is difficult to
say with certainty whether the collection of all the devotions and other
chapters was done by him or whether the current form of *Kriyakalāpa* is a later
addition, because, firstly, Soni himself has not provided any systematic
information about it. If Soni had been kind enough to mention in the
introduction the number of manuscripts he used for the compilation, where they
are from, and their date of writing, it would have been a great help in
determining how old this collection is. Secondly, it contains many useful
topics, but the absence of Pandit Prabhācandra's commentary on them makes it
difficult to accept that they were before him. For example,
*Prākṛtanirvāṇabhakti*, which is known in the world as *Nirvāṇakāṇḍa*, is
included in this collection, but there is no commentary on it by him. While it
is located in the middle of other devotions. Soni has clarified the situation in
his introduction to the printed *Kriyakalāpa*, but it does not shed complete
light on the matter.  - Of the devotions included in this collection, the first
chapter contains seven devotions: Siddhi-bhakti, Śruta-bhakti, Cāritra-bhakti,
Yogi-bhakti, Ācārya-bhakti, Nirvāṇa-bhakti, and Nandīśvara-bhakti. Of these,
Nandīśvara...  1. See *Kriyakalāpa* Introduction, p. 21. 2. "Thus ends the first
chapter of *Kriyakalāpaṭīkā* written by Pandit Prabhācandra, describing
devotion." 3. It is certain that at the end of the chapter called
*Daivaśikaraātrikapratīkramaṇa*, there is a writing available in which the year
1724 is mentioned. Therefore, it can be said that this collection is from before
that time. See *Kriyakalāpa*, Introduction, p. 69.

**Sarvarthasiddhi**  Devotion in Sanskrit is only in Sanskrit, the rest of the
devotions are in both Sanskrit and Prakrit. Only the Prakrit Nirvanabhakti does
not have a Sanskrit commentary. Further, in the next chapter, many more
devotions are collected and these also have a Sanskrit commentary by Pandit
Prabhachandra. It is certain that the short devotions do not have a commentary.
**84**  Regarding these devotions, Pandit Prabhachandra informs at the end of
the Prakrit Siddhibhakti that all Sanskrit devotions are created by Pujyapada
Swami and Prakrit devotions are created by Acharya Kundakunda. As follows:
"Sanskritah sarvah bhaktayaḥ padapujyasvamikṛtāḥ prākṛtāstu
kundakundācāryakṛtāḥ." Kriyakalāpa pṛṣṭha 167  Whether all these devotions are
the work of one Acharya or many, it is difficult to say for sure. Pandit
Prabhachandra, who wrote the commentary on these, probably lived sometime after
Panditpravara Ashadhar and before VS 1724. Therefore, on this basis, it can only
be said that these were written sometime before the 14th century VS. But this
statement does not determine which Sanskrit and Prakrit devotions Pandit
Prabhachandra considered to be by Pujyapada Swami and Kundakunda Acharya. It is
also not known who his Swami was.  So these Pujyapada...  Pandit Pannalalji Soni
has written in the introduction of Kriyakalāpa that "Siddhibhakti, Śrutibhakti,
Charitrabhakti, Yogibhakti, Ācāryabhakti, Nirvāṇabhakti and Nandīśvarabhakti are
the seven Sanskrit devotions created by Pujyapada Swami and Prakrit
Siddhibhakti, Prakrit Śrutibhakti, Prakrit Nāriṣabhakti, Prakrit Yogabhakti and
Prakrit Ācāryabhakti are the five devotions created by Kundakunda Acharya." But
the reason he has given for believing this cannot be said to be appropriate.
Pandit Prabhachandra has only said that all Sanskrit devotions are created by
Pujyapada Swami and all Prakrit devotions are created by Kundakunda Acharya, and
he has also said this at the end of his commentary on Prakrit Siddhibhakti. But
looking at the order in which these devotions are collected in Kriyakalāpa, the
Prakrit Siddhibhakti is number two. It is possible that Soni ji, seeing the end
of the chapter on Nandīśvarabhakti, made this assumption. Whatever it may be, it
is clear that in the time of Pandit Prabhachandra, these devotions were
considered to be by Pujyapada Swami and Kundakunda Acharya. Scholars believe
that this Pujyapada Swami must be Acharya Pujyapada, because there has been no
other Acharya with this name. Secondly, the uninterrupted flow and serious style
of these devotions indicate this.  In all these devotions, the subject matter is
discussed according to their names. Muni, Vrati, Grihastha, Devasika, etc. have
been using them in a definite order during Pratikramana, which is partially in
practice even today.  **5. Jainendra Grammar**  Acharya Pujyapada's most
original work is his Jainendra Grammar. Why is it called Jainendra? It is
difficult to decide whether Acharya Pujyapada himself liked this name. But it
has been addressed by this name since ancient times, which is clear from the
mention of Pandit Bopdev, the author of Mugdha Bodha:  "Indraścandrah
kāśakṛtsnāpiśalīśākataayanaḥ. Pāṇigyamaranē jayantyastau ca śābdhikāḥ."
**Chatupaṭha**  It is divided into five chapters and has about 3000 sutras. Its
biggest feature is the noun...  1. Pandit Prabhachandra has quoted two verses
from Anāgāradharmāmṛta in his commentary. See Kriyakalāpa introduction p. 10. 2.
See commentary 3 p. 88. 3. See Jain Literature and History p. 121.  i

## Introduction  This is concise. The Jain grammar uses abbreviations for many
terms, making it easier to use. Compare this to Panini's grammar.  Jainendra
grammar uses short, long, and prolonged sounds. It uses the same sounds for
nasal sounds. It uses the terms "guna" and "vriddhi" (vowel changes). It uses
the terms "nistha" and "pratipadika" (stems).  The grammar uses abbreviations,
special constructions, and omissions, which makes the sutras (rules) concise.
For example, in Panini's grammar:  **Panini's Grammar:**  * **झरो झरि सवर्णे**
(jharo jhari savarne) * **झरो झरि स्वे हलो यमा यमि लोप:** (jharo jhari sve halo
yama yami lopa:) * **हलो यमा यमि खम् तुल्यास्यप्रयत्न सवर्णम्** (halo yama yami
kham tulyasyaprayatna savarnam) * **सस्थान क्रियं स्वम्
ऊकालोऽज्झस्वदीर्घप्लुतः** (sasthana kriyam svam ukalodjjhasvadirghapluta:) *
**आकालोऽच् प्रदीपः** (akalo'c pradipa:)  **Jainendra Grammar:**  *
**सिद्धिरनेकान्तात।** (siddhiranekantat)  The first sutra of this grammar is
"siddhiranekantat."  Somdeva Suri explains this in his commentary,
"Shabdarnavacandrika," saying that the meaning of words and their understanding
depend on anekantavada (the doctrine of many-sidedness). This is because words
have the characteristics of existence and non-existence, permanence and
impermanence, and qualifier and qualified. This sutra applies to the entire
text. If we don't accept anekantavada, then we can't determine what is the
beginning and what is the end, what is similar and what is different.  The
grammarians believe in the "sphota" theory, which states that words are eternal
and their sound is produced by the contact of the tongue and other organs.
However, this is not true. The sounds like "a" and words like "ghata" (pot) and
"pata" (cloth) don't exist in the sky, nor are they qualities of the sky. They
are produced by the combination of different sounds and disappear over time.
Therefore, according to the grammarians, they cannot be considered eternal. They
are eternal in relation to the pudgala dravya (matter), but they are impermanent
in relation to the paryaya (modes). It is clear that Acharya Pujyapada wrote the
first sutra, "siddhiranekantat," to express this idea.  The way words are
defined in grammar, the terms and suffixes used, are not absolute. They are just
one way of explaining the language. This is why different grammarians have used
different terms and processes to explain the formation of words. Despite this,
many scholars insist on specific suffixes and methods for word formation. It is
possible that Acharya Pujyapada wrote the sutra "siddhiranekantat" to reject
this one-sided approach.  Acharya Pujyapada mentions the views of six teachers
in his Jainendra grammar: Bhootbali, Shridatta, Yashobhdra, Prabhachandra,
Samantabhadra, and Siddhasena. As far as we know, none of them wrote a grammar.
The views of these teachers that are mentioned in the text...

## 86 ## Sarvarthasiddhi  These opinions, which have been presented as forms of
Siddhi, are not new. Because, as we will explain later, their Siddhi is also
evident in Panini's grammar through alternatives. Therefore, the question
arises: why did Acharya Pujyapada mention these opinions separately as those of
these Acharyas, when Panini's grammar was available to him and these usages were
found in it? The question is serious and it is possible that it may shed light
on some historical facts in the future. For the time being, it appears to us
that just as Rishi Panini mentioned the opinions found in the literature
available until his time in his grammar, along with the names of their authors
or by using terms like 'anyatar' etc., similarly, Acharya Pujyapada mentioned
the opinions found in Jain literature available until his time in his Jainendra
grammar, along with the names of their authors. The details of the opinions are
as follows:  **Bhutbali:** The sutra that presents the opinion of Acharya
Bhutbali is 'Ravabhatbaleh'. 3, 4, 831. According to Bhutbali's opinion, the
'kha' suffix is formed from the Dvigu compound ending in 'sama'. This is the
meaning of this sutra. From this, the usage 'Vaisamin:' is established as an
alternative to the usage 'Samik:'. Similarly, 'Ratryah: Sambarsarat'. 3, 4, 841
and 'Varshad-upac'. 3, 4, 85. These are two other sutras that present the
alternative opinion of Acharya Bhutbali. The first sutra establishes usages like
'Dviraatrinah, Vayahinah and Dvisambatsarinah' etc., while the second sutra
establishes usages like 'Dvivarshah' etc. These alternative functions have been
considered in Jainendra grammar according to the opinion of Acharya Bhutbali.
Panini has also indicated these alternative functions, but he has not mentioned
whose opinion these functions are based on. In place of these three sutras,
Panini's 'Dvigo-rva 5, 1, 86', 'Ratryah: Sambatsaran-s 5, 1, 87', and 'Varshal-
luk cha 5, 1, 881' come respectively.  **Jina-Acharya Shridatta:** The sutra
that presents the opinion of Acharya Shridatta is 'Gane Shrivat-syastriyam. 1.4,
341'. According to Acharya Shridatta, the fifth case ending is formed due to
Guna. However, this function does not occur in the feminine gender. This is the
meaning of this sutra. According to this, the usage 'Manamathah' is established
as an alternative to 'Jnanen Muktah' according to Acharya Shridatta's opinion.
In its place, the sutra 'Vibhasha Gun-e'astriyam. 2, 3, 25.' is found in
Panini's grammar.  **Yashobadra-Acharya:** The sutra that presents the opinion
of Acharya Yashobadra is 'Krishimoojam Yashobadrasth. 2, 1, 991'. According to
Acharya Yashobadra, the 'kyap' suffix is formed from the roots 'kri, vrisha and
mrij'. Accordingly, the alternative usages 'Kutyam, Vridhyam and Mukhyam' are
established. In its place, the two sutras 'Majevibhasha. 3, 1, 113.' and
'Vibhasha Krivrukshoh 3, 1, 120.' are found in Panini's grammar.  **Prabhavakha-
Acharya:** The sutra that presents the opinion of Acharya Prabhachandra is
'Ravah Kriti Prabhavastha 4, 3, 1801'. When the word 'ratri' is a secondary word
and the 'kridanta' is present, the 'mum' is added according to Prabhachandra's
opinion. Accordingly, the alternative usage 'Ratricharah' is established. In its
place, Panini's grammar has the sutra 'Rakati Vibhasha. 6, 3, 721'.
**Samantbhadra-Acharya:** The sutra that presents the four opinions of Acharya
Samantbhadra is 'Chatustayam Samast-bhasya. 5, 4, 1401'. It is mentioned in this
sutra that the previous four sutras have been said according to Acharya
Samantbhadra's opinion. Those four are: 'Bhayoh Hah. 5, 4, 1361', 'Shachho'ti.
5, 4, 1371', 'Halo Yama Yami Kham. 5, 4, 1381', and 'Bharo Jh-ari Swe. 5, 4,
1391'. In their place, Panini's sutras are respectively: 'Jhayoh Ho'nyatarasyam.
8, 4, 621', 'Saro'ti 184, 631', 'Halo Yama Yami Lopah. 8, 4, 64', and 'Jharo Jh-
ari Savarna. 8.4, 651'.

## Introduction  According to the first sutra, 'h' is a पूर्वसवर्ण (pre-vowel)
when it follows a पदान्त झय (final consonant 'y'). For example, 'सुवाग्दसति'.
According to the second sutra, 'ch' replaces 'sh' when it follows a पदान्त झय
(final consonant 'y'). For example, 'षट्छयामाः'. According to the third sutra,
the second 'y' is deleted when it follows a हल (consonant) and is followed by
'ym'. For example, in the word 'जय्या', there are two 'y's and a third 'y' is
formed by their combination. But according to the rule of this sutra, the middle
'y' is deleted and the remaining usage is 'शय्या'. According to the fourth
sutra, the third 't' is deleted when it follows a हल (consonant) and is followed
by a सवर्ण झर (similar consonant 't'). For example, 'भित्ताम'. These four
alternative actions occur according to the opinion of Acharya Samantabhadra.
While in Panini's grammar, these actions are considered to be of another
opinion.  ## Siddhasena-Acharya  The sutra that explains the opinion of Acharya
Siddhasena is - 'वेत्तेः सिद्धसेनस्य । 5, 1, 71'. The meaning of this sutra is
that according to Siddhasena, 'रुट' is added to the 'अत्' which is the आदेशभूत
(substitute) for the झ् प्रत्यय (suffix 't') that follows the विद् धातु (verb
root 'vid'). For example, 'संविद्रते'. In the usage 'संविदते', 'रुट' is added
after the 'd' and before the 'a' to form this alternative usage. In place of
this sutra, the sutra 'वेत्तेविभाषा।7,1,7.' is found in Panini's grammar.  ##
The Grammar  A modified form of this grammar is available in the
'गाब्दार्णवचन्द्रिका' written by Somdevsuri. But according to many proofs,
Premji has proved that it is a later refined form. The original text is the one
that is available in the 'महावृत्ति' written by Acharya Abhaydev. We have
mentioned some of the special features of this grammar. There are many other
special features due to which it has its own independent place.  ## Other Works
of Acharya Pujyapada  It is known from the mentions that Acharya Pujyapada wrote
many other books on various subjects besides the five mentioned above. The
details are as follows:  6.-7. Jainendra and Shabdavatar Nyas - The 46th
inscription in the Nagar Tahsil of Shimoga district mentions that Acharya
Pujyapada wrote a 'Jainendra' Nyas on his own grammar and a 'Shabdavatar' Nyas
on Panini's grammar. For example:  'न्यासं जैनेन्द्रसंज्ञं सकलबुधनुतं पाणिनीयस्य
भूयो। न्यासं शब्दावतारं मनुजततिहितं वैद्यशास्त्रं च कृत्वा । यस्तत्त्वार्थस्य
टीका व्यरचदिह तां भात्यसो पूज्यपाद स्वामी भूपालवन्द्यः
स्वपरहितवचःपूर्णवृग्बोधवृत्तः ॥'  Both of these are not available yet. Special
research is needed in ancient libraries for this.  8. Shantiastaka - We have
already mentioned the story of Acharya Pujyapada. The author of that story has
mentioned a 'Shantiastaka' created by him. A Shantiastaka is also collected in a
ritual activity. There is a Sanskrit commentary on it by Pandit Prabhachanda. In
the beginning of the Shantiastaka, Pandit Prabhachandra, while supporting the
opinion of the story writer Chandrayya Kavi, says that Sri Pad Pujya Swami had a
disease of the eyes called 'mirvyaadhi' and to overcome it, he praises saying,
'न स्नेहात्'. The verse that comes at the end also expresses the same sentiment
through the words 'विष्टि प्रसन्नां कुरु' etc. This shows that it is possible
that at the end of his life, Acharya Pujyapada's vision was covered by darkness
and he composed the Shantiastaka to overcome it.  For special knowledge about
the commentary, notes, and additions of this book, see the book 'Jain Sahitya
aur Itihas' written by Premji.

##  All-Purpose Success (Sarvarthasiddhi)  It is written. If this assumption is
correct, then the Shanti Ashtak can be considered their work, which was probably
written at the end of all their works.  9. **Essence Collection (Sarasangraha)**
- It is known from a mention by Dhavla that Acharya Pujyapada also created a
work called 'Sarasangraha'. As follows:  "In the Sarasangraha, it is also stated
that in the case of the acquisition of one of the many synonyms of an object
that is infinite in synonyms, the Nay (principle) that is free from defects,
which is dependent on the cause of birth, is the right one."  The characteristic
of Nay given by Acharya Pujyapada in the Sarvarthasiddhi is very similar to this
characteristic, therefore there is sufficient reason to believe that this work
should be the work of Acharya Pujyapada.  10. **Medical Science (Chikitsa
Shastra)** - There is also much evidence to prove that Acharya Pujyapada wrote
an unparalleled work on the subject of medicine. As follows:  1. We have already
mentioned a verse from the Jnanarnava written by Acharya Shubhachandra. In it,
his words are said to remove the body's impurities, just like the impurities of
speech and mind.  2. Acharya Ugraditiya, in his work called Kalyanakarak, has
mentioned the medical work of Acharya Pujyapada in the words "Poojyapadena
Bhashitah, Shalakyam Poojyapadprakatitam Adhikam".  3. We have already mentioned
an inscription number 46 from the Nagar Taluk of Shimoga district, in which he
is also called the author of medical science, who benefits human society.  4.
Mangaraj, a scholar of the 15th century Vikram era, has also mentioned a medical
work of Acharya Pujyapada in his Kannada language work Khagendramani Darpan.
_All these evidences show that Acharya Pujyapada probably wrote a work related
to medicine._  11. **Abhisheka** - It is also known from inscription number 40
of the Saka year 1085 at Shravanabelagola that he had also composed a Jain
Abhisheka text. The quote is as follows:  "Jainendra Nijashabdabhogmatalam
Sarvarthasiddhi: Para Siddhanta Niputvatmudghakavita Jainabhishekah Swakah.
Chandassukshmadhiyam Samaashishatakaswasthyam Yadiyam Vidam Akyatiha Sa
Poojyapāvmunipah Poojyo Muninam Ganaih."  It states that Acharya Pujyapada,
whose Jainendra grammar indicates his unparalleled wealth of words, his mastery
of the Sarvarthasiddhi principles, the excellence of his Jain Abhisheka poetry,
and the subtlety of his Samadhishataka Chanda Shastra, which is conducive to
mental health, is constantly worthy of worship by the Muni Ganas.  We have
already given a brief biography of Acharya Pujyapada based on Chandrayya Kavi's
'Poojyapadacharita'. In it, Acharya Pujyapada is described as the author of
Arhatprasthitalakshan, similar to Jainendra grammar and medicine, and also of
astrology. It cannot be said how accurate this mention is. If it is true, then
it must be said that Acharya Pujyapada also composed works on Arhatprasthita and
astrology.  6. **Time Consideration** - The question of when Acharya Pujyapada
lived is not particularly controversial. From the middle of the 5th century
onwards, almost all the literary figures have either mentioned him or his
literature in some form or another, or have followed his literature. From this
point of view, the special commentary of Jinabhadra Gani Kshamasraman and the
Tattvarthavatika of Akalankdeva are mainly present before us. When Bhatta
Akalankdeva was writing the Tattvarthavatika, the Sarvarthasiddhi and
Jainendravyakaran were present before him.

## Introduction  89 . . It is clearly evident. Bhattaraka Akalankadeva, in his
Tattvarthavartika, presents most of the arguments of the Sarvarthasiddhi in the
form of Vatikas. And wherever he felt the need to mention the rules of grammar,
he usually refers to the sutras of Jainendra. Therefore, it is certain that
Acharya Pujyapada came before Bhattaraka Akalankadeva. But a comparative study
of the Sarvarthasiddhi and the Visheshavashakabhashya also reveals that the
Sarvarthasiddhi must have been present before Jinabhadragani Kshamashraman when
he wrote the Visheshavashakabhashya. For comparison, see Sarvarthasiddhi,
Chapter 1, Sutra 15, where the definition of Dharana Matigyan is given in these
words: 'Avestya Kalantaram Avismaranakaranam.' In the Visheshavashakabhashya,
the same words are repeated and it is said: 'Kalantaram Ya Jam Punaranusaranam
Dharana Sa U || Ga. 291 ||' While explaining that the eye sense organ is not
capable of perceiving, the Sarvarthasiddhi, Chapter 1, Sutra 19, says:
'Manovavaprapkaryati.' The same thing is expressed in the Visheshavashakabhashya
in these words: 'Loyanam Apattavisayam Manoshya || Ga. 209 ||' In
Sarvarthasiddhi, Chapter 1, Sutra 20, it is doubted that at the time of the
first attainment of Samyaktva, both types of knowledge arise simultaneously,
therefore, it cannot be said that Shrutagyan is prior to Matigyan. As: 'Ah,
Prathamasamyaktvotapti Yugapajgyanparinamamanmatipurvatvam Shrutasyanotpadyata
iti.' Now, in the light of this, see this gatha from the Visheshavashakabhashya:
'Nana Nanaani Ya Samkalaai Jo Mahasuyai. _ To Na Suyam Maipugvam Mahanaane Va
Suyannaanam || Ga. 107 ||' Thus, although this comparison reveals that Acharya
Pujyapada's Sarvarthasiddhi must have been present before Jinabhadragani
Kshamashraman (Vikram Samvat 666), it does not shed much light on their actual
time period. For this, see the following evidence: 1. In a copper plate
inscription from Merkara (Kurg) written in Saka Samvat 388 (Vikram Samvat 523),
the lineage of Kundakunda and the local Ganaka Munis is given along with the
mention of King Avinita of the Ganga dynasty. From other evidence, it is also
known that King Avinita's son's name was Duvinita and he was a disciple of
Acharya Pujyapada. The reign of King Duvinita is considered to be around Vikram
Samvat 538, therefore, on this basis, it can be said that Acharya Pujyapada must
have lived between the latter half of the 5th century and the early half of the
6th century Vikram Samvat. 2. This fact is also corroborated by a mention in the
Darshanasara of Devasena, written in Vikram Samvat 990. Devasena has stated that
Vajranandi, a disciple of Shri Pujyapada, established the Dravida Sangha in
Vikram Samvat 526. The mention in the Darshanasara is as follows:
Siripujjapadasiiso Davidsanghass Karago Ho. Name Na Vajjanavi Pahubvedi
Mahasatto. . See Tattvarthavartika 401, Sutra 1, Vati 3 etc. 2. See
Tattvarthavartika, Chapter 4, Sutra 21. 3. Ratnakarandi, Introduction, page 142.

90 Panchasaye Chabbise Sarvarthasiddhi Vikkramarayassa Maranapatassa | Mahara
Jado Davidyayo Mahamoho ||  We have already mentioned the list of the Nandisangh
in the previous section. In it, the time of Devanandi (Pujiyapada) is given from
Vikram Samvat 258 to 308. After mentioning Jayanandi and Gunanandi, the name of
Vajranandi is mentioned. We have also mentioned the lineage of
Shubhachandracharya, the author of the Pandavapurana. In this too, the names of
all the Acharyas of the Nandisangh are mentioned according to the list of the
Nandisangh. But in this, after Devanandi, the name of Gunanandi is mentioned and
then the name of Vachananandi is given. Here, although we may accept that this
difference between the two is not very important, because according to the
earlier tradition, those who received the lineage of the Acharyas in a
particular order mentioned their names in that order, and in such a situation,
it is natural for one or more names to be omitted or changed. But the biggest
question is about the time of Acharya Pujiyapada. The names of the Acharyas
mentioned in the copper plate of Merkara do not include the name of Pujiyapada,
and Durvinita, the son of Avinita, was his Vidya Guru, so it seems that the
names of the Acharyas preceding Acharya Pujiyapada have been omitted from the
list of the Nandisangh. The names of the monks mentioned in the copper plate of
Merkara are: Gunachandra, Abhayanandi, Shilabhadra, Jananandi, Gunanandi and
Chandranandi. And in the list of the Nandisangh, two names, Jayanandi and
Gunanandi, are mentioned between Acharya Devanandi and Vachananandi. The name
Gunanandi is also mentioned in the copper plate of Merkara, and it is possible
that the one whose name is given as Jananandi in the copper plate of Merkara is
the same as Jayanandi mentioned in the list of the Nandisangh. If this
assumption is correct, then it solves two problems. Firstly, it confirms the
assumption that the names of some Acharyas preceding Acharya Pujiyapada have
been omitted from the list of the Nandisangh. Secondly, according to the names
mentioned in the copper plate of Merkara, the two Acharyas mentioned after
Acharya Pujiyapada in the list of the Nandisangh, are considered to be preceding
Acharya Pujiyapada, and according to the mention in the Darshanasara,
Vachananandi is considered to be succeeding Acharya Pujiyapada. And in this way,
the difficulty that appears in determining their time is resolved. Thus,
considering all these facts, it can be said that Acharya Pujiyapada should be
considered to be a contemporary of the middle period from the latter half of the
5th century Vikram to the first half of the 6th century. Shriman Pandit
Nathuramji Premi and other scholars also have almost the same opinion.  1- See
Jain Literature and History pp. 115 etc. Premiji, while considering the time of
Acharya Pujiyapada, agrees with the opinion of late Dr. Kashinath Bapuji Pathak.
We have concluded from that.

##  [108] **Sarvarth Siddhi**  This section provides guidance on the order in
which the absence of effort-achievable (yatnasadhya) things occurs for a
liberated muni, upon attaining the cause of liberation (moksha). 361  It also
explains how liberation is achieved through the absence of certain emotions,
along with the practice of both types of tapas (austerities) and nirjara
(purification). 361, 368  The section further explores the different levels of
nirjara (purification) for different individuals. 370  It explains the cause of
attaining the state of bhavya (worthy of liberation) and the countless qualities
that are present in liberation. 361, 370  The section also provides a detailed
explanation of the absence of certain emotions in liberation and the five types
of nirgrantha (liberated beings). 361, 370  It discusses the infinite strength
(virya) and other qualities present in liberation, and explains the meaning of
terms like pulaka (a state of bliss). 363, 370  The section addresses the
question of the size of liberated beings and explains why they are not as large
as the loka-akasha (the space of the universe). 363  It also explains the
different types of nirgrantha based on their practice of restraint (samyama),
knowledge (shruta), service (pratisevana), and other factors. 364, 371  The
section discusses the movement of liberated beings beyond the loka-anta (the
boundary of the universe) and the reasons behind it. 364  It provides examples
to support the reasons for this movement. 364, 365  The section explains the
reasons for the movement beyond the loka-anta and the different types of
liberated beings based on their field (kshetra), etc. 365  It also explains the
two types of nayas (perspectives) used in this discussion and the different
types of liberated beings based on their location (sthana), time (kala), and
other factors. 365, 373  The tenth chapter discusses the different types of
liberated beings based on their movement (gati). 373  It explains the cause of
the emergence of kevalgyan (omniscience) and the sign (linga) of karma-kshaya
(destruction of karma). 373  The section also explains the different types of
liberated beings based on their tirtha (spiritual teacher), charitra (conduct),
buddhi (intellect), jnana (knowledge), avagahan (understanding), and other
factors. 367, 374  It explains why moha (delusion) is destroyed first and the
order in which it is destroyed. 367  The section discusses the destruction of
the remaining karma, such as jnana-avaran (knowledge-obscuring karma), in a
kshina-kashaya (one with diminished passions) and the order in which it is
destroyed. 367  It also explains the different types of liberated beings based
on their number (sankhya). 374  The section explains the nature of liberation
with reasons and the different types of liberated beings based on their kshetra
(field), etc. 368, 374  It explains the meaning of the term "Sarvarth Siddhi"
and the absence of effort-achievable things for different types of liberated
beings. 368, 375  The section concludes with a praise of the Veerajina (the
liberated ones). 375

**The Sarvarthasiddhi Composed by the Venerable Acharya**  **Chapter One**  I
bow down to the one who is the guide of the path to liberation, the destroyer of
the mountains of karma, the mother of all universal principles, for the
attainment of such qualities.  1. A certain worthy soul, who was close to
liberation, wise, and desirous of his own welfare, went to a secluded hermitage,
a place of rest for worthy beings, which was extremely pleasant. There, in the
midst of an assembly of monks, he saw a great Acharya, who was like a living
embodiment of the path to liberation, even though he did not speak. He was
skilled in logic and scripture, and his primary work was to teach the welfare of
others. He was worthy of being served by noble souls. This worthy soul
approached the Acharya with humility and asked, "O Venerable One, what is the
welfare of the soul?" The Acharya replied, "The welfare of the soul is
liberation." The worthy soul then asked, "What is the nature of liberation, and
what is the means of attaining it?" The Acharya said, "When the soul is
completely free from the stains of karma, both subtle and gross, and from the
body, then the state that arises, which is characterized by its inconceivable,
inherent qualities of knowledge, etc., and by uninterrupted bliss, is called
liberation."  82. Because liberation is extremely subtle, those who are ignorant
and claim to be Tirthankaras describe its nature in a completely different way,
using words that are based on false logic and do not touch upon its true nature.
For example, (1. Samkhya) the nature of the Purusha is consciousness, which is
the object of knowledge.

2] "All-purpose accomplishment is the goal, but the means are not clear." This
is a statement that is both true and false, because it is without form. "The
destruction of the qualities of intellect, etc., is the liberation of the soul."
This is also a false assumption, because there is no such thing as a thing
without a specific characteristic. "The extinction of the lamp is the extinction
of the soul." This is also a false assumption, because it is like the idea of a
donkey having horns, which is a mere figment of the imagination. We will discuss
the true nature of this in the next chapter. 83. They also disagree about the
means of attaining it. Some say that liberation is attained through knowledge
alone, without any need for conduct. Others say that it is attained through
faith alone. Still others say that it is attained through conduct alone, without
any need for knowledge. But just as the mere knowledge, faith, or conduct of a
medicine is not a means of curing a disease for a sick person, so too,
knowledge, etc., are not means of attaining liberation. The knowledge is absent.
But such consciousness, being the true nature, is also false, because if one
believes this, it does not acquire any form, i.e., its own nature, as a
characteristic of its own activity. (2. Vaisheshika) The destruction of the
special qualities of intellect, etc., is the liberation of the soul. But this
assumption is also inappropriate, because there is no such thing as a thing
without a specific characteristic. (3. Buddhist) Just as a lamp goes out, so
too, the extinction of the soul's offspring is liberation. But just as a
donkey's horns are only a matter of imagination and not a real thing, so too,
this kind of liberation is only a matter of imagination and not a real thing.
This is evident from their own statements. And so on. We will discuss the
faultless nature of this liberation later (in the tenth chapter, verse 2). 83.
In the same way, these proponents also argue about the subject of its
attainment. Some believe that (1) liberation is attained through knowledge
independent of conduct. Others believe that (2) liberation is attained through
faith alone. And others believe that (3) liberation is attained through conduct
independent of knowledge. But just as the mere knowledge, faith, or conduct of a
medicine is not a means of curing a disease for a sick person, so too, separate
knowledge, etc., are not means of attaining liberation. Special Note - What has
been explained so far is the essence of the Tattvartha Sutra and its first
verse. It first points out the reason for its composition. The intention is that
a certain soul, in search of the welfare of the soul, went to a secluded and
pleasant hermitage and there, in the assembly of the monks, asked a question of
the Nirgrantha Acharya. From this, the Tattvartha Sutra was composed. This is
also confirmed by the introduction given at the beginning of the Tattvartha
Vartika. But there, after pointing out the first verse, another meaning is also
mentioned. It is stated there that others explain the composition of the
Tattvartha Sutra in this way: "The power of men is declining here, so in order
to reveal the process of the principles, the composition of the scriptures
begins in a sequential order in relation to the instruction of the path of
liberation, and the verse "Samyagdarshanjnanacharitrani mokshamargah" is said."
Here, the disciple and the teacher 1. Mouth. That a. 2. - because of the
donkey's horns. Increase Mu. 3. 'The complete destruction of the special
qualities of the soul is liberation - Prash. Vyo. p. 638 1 4. And so on. That

no unpleasant contact. There is no desire for the loss of the beloved, no
separation from the beloved, that is the abode of peace, eternal and unshakable.
Just as a lamp, when it is extinguished, does not go to the forest, nor to the
sky. It does not go to any direction, nor to any direction, it only goes to
peace because of the loss of attachment. Saundarya 16 27-29. 'The extinction of
the lamp is the liberation of his mind.' - Vartikaalam. 11451 6. - like the

## Chapter One  The connection is not intended, but the Acharya's desire was to
liberate beings immersed in the ocean of existence. However, without the
teachings of the path to liberation, their welfare cannot be taught. Therefore,
this scripture was composed with the desire to explain the path to liberation.
It seems that by this mention, the Tattvarthavartika-kara has indicated the
Uththānika of the Tattvarthādhigamabhāṣya. In the Tattvarthādhigamabhāṣya, an
Uththānika of the same meaning is found. Śrutaśāgara Sūri has also stated the
same in his Śrutaśāgarī, that at the request of a disciple, the Acharya composed
the Tattvartha Sutra. In it, the disciple's name is given as Dvyaka. From this,
it appears that the main intention of the Sarvarthasiddhi is that the Tattvartha
Sutra was composed at the behest of a disciple. Further, the discussion of
liberation in the Uththānika has briefly examined the essence of liberation. The
rule is that due to karma, the actions that occur, the soul's oneness and the
understanding of what is desirable and undesirable, lead to existence.
Therefore, when karma, bhavakarma and nokarma are separated from the soul, the
state of the soul's natural state of happiness, free from obstacles, with its
own knowledge and other qualities, is called liberation. This is proven.
However, other proponents are unable to analyze the essence of liberation in
this way. Pujyapada Swami has presented three examples from the mouth of
Gṛddhipiccha Acharya, the author of the Tattvartha Sutra, through which the
essence of liberation is presented incorrectly. From this context, the first
examination of the Sankhya doctrine is done. Although the Sankhyas have
considered the permanent removal of the three types of suffering - spiritual,
physical and divine - as liberation, yet they consider the soul to be of a
conscious nature, but also devoid of knowledge. Their belief is that although
the dharma of knowledge is of nature, due to contact, the Purusha experiences
himself as knowledgeable and nature experiences itself as conscious. Therefore,
here, instead of criticizing the Sankhya's essence of liberation, the Purusha
essence has been criticized and declared false. The second view is that of the
Vaisheshikas. The Vaisheshikas, although they have accepted the special
qualities of knowledge, etc., in the soul through the relationship of samavaya,
yet they consider their separation from the soul as its liberation. They have
stated that the origin of special qualities like intellect, etc., is due to the
non-samavaya cause, which is the union of the soul and mind. In the state of
liberation, since there is no union of the soul and mind, therefore, there is a
complete absence of special qualities there. In their view, the special
qualities of all pervasive substances are considered momentary, therefore, they
do not consider it an objection that there is an absence of special qualities
like knowledge, etc., in liberation. Now, if in the liberated state, the soul is
considered devoid of knowledge, etc., like attachment and aversion, then the
soul does not stand as an independent substance, because a thing that does not
have any kind of special characteristic cannot be a thing. This is the reason
why their belief has also been declared false. The third view is that of the
Buddhists. In the Buddhists, there are two types of nirvana - Sopadhisheṣa and
Nirupadhisheṣa. In Sopadhisheṣa nirvana, only the destruction of the ātravas in
the form of ignorance, craving, etc., takes place, the pure stream of
consciousness remains. But in Nirupadhisheṣa nirvana, even the stream of
consciousness is destroyed. Here, keeping in mind this second aspect of
liberation, its examination has been done. In this regard, the Buddhists say
that just as a lamp, when extinguished, does not go up, down, right, left,
forward, backward, but remains quiet there, in the same way, the end of the
soul's offspring is its liberation. After this, the soul's offspring does not
continue, it remains quiet there. While examining this essence of the Buddhists,
the Acharya has stated that their imagination is false.

## Sarvarthasiddhi  [1118484. What then? It is said that these three are
combined: Right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct are the path to
liberation. ||1|| $5. The word "samyak" is either un-derived or derived. From
the root "añc" with the suffix "kvip" and the prefix "sam", the word "samyak" is
formed. Its meaning is praise. It should be combined with each of the words:
faith, knowledge, and conduct. Thus, we have right faith, right knowledge, and
right conduct. We will explain their nature in detail later on, in terms of
their characteristics and distinctions. Here, we are only mentioning the
purpose: the word "samyak" is used as a qualifier for faith, for the purpose of
collecting faith based on the true knowledge of the objects. To know the objects
in the same way as they exist, including the soul, is right knowledge. The word
"samyak" is used as a qualifier for knowledge, for the purpose of removing
delusion, doubt, and wrong knowledge. Right conduct is the cessation of actions
that are the cause of the acquisition of karma, for the person who is striving
to remove the causes of the cycle of birth and death. The word "samyak" is used
as a qualifier for conduct, for the purpose of removing conduct based on
ignorance. 6. Seeing or just the act of seeing is faith. Knowing or just the act
of knowing is knowledge.  In this way, after examining the principles of
liberation in brief, the Acharya has examined the principles of its cause. In
this context, it is only necessary to write that most people of different views
believe that liberation is achieved through one or the other of faith,
knowledge, and conduct. Whether it is the Samkhya, the Buddhists, or the
Vaisheshikas, all of them have considered true knowledge or wisdom as the main
means of liberation. The path of devotion or chanting of the name is another
form of faith. There is also a strong group that considers chanting of the name
as the main means of liberation from the cycle of birth and death. This group is
becoming increasingly powerful. To chant the name of one's chosen deity is
another form of it. But just as the cure of a disease cannot be achieved by just
one cause, such as seeing the medicine, similarly, liberation cannot be achieved
by just one of these. Then what is the means of achieving liberation? This
question remains. To answer this question, the Acharya has composed the first
sutra. He says: Right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, these three
together are the path to liberation. ||1|| 85. The word "samyak" is un-derived,
i.e., a root word, and derived, i.e., grammatically formed. When it is derived
grammatically, it is formed by adding the suffix "kvip" to the root "añc" with
the prefix "sam". In Sanskrit, its derivation is "sam añcati iti samyak". In
Prakrit, its meaning is praise. It should be combined with each of the words:
faith, knowledge, and conduct. Thus, we have right faith, right knowledge, and
right conduct. We will explain their nature in detail later on, in terms of
their characteristics and distinctions. Here, we are only mentioning the name:
the word "samyak" is used as a qualifier for faith, for the purpose of
collecting faith based on the true knowledge of the objects. To know the objects
in the same way as they exist, including the soul, is right knowledge. The word
"samyak" is used as a qualifier for knowledge, for the purpose of removing
delusion (lack of conviction), doubt, and wrong knowledge. Right conduct is the
cessation of actions that are the cause of the acquisition of karma, for the
person who is striving to remove the causes of the cycle of birth and death. The
word "samyak" is used as a qualifier for conduct, for the purpose of removing

## Chapter 1: Knowledge  **11187]**  **The term "Darshan" (perception) refers to
that which sees, is seen by, or is the act of seeing itself. The term "Jnana"
(knowledge) refers to that which knows, is known by, or is the act of knowing
itself. The term "Charitra" (conduct) refers to that which acts, is acted upon,
or is the act of acting itself.**  **Doubt:** If we derive the meaning of these
terms in this way, then the doer and the instrument become one, which is
contradictory.  **Resolution:** While this statement is true, it is made with
the intention of distinguishing between the effect and the cause. For example,
the statement "Fire burns fuel by the effect of burning" is made with the
intention of distinguishing between the fire and the fuel. Similarly, in the
case of synonyms and their meanings, there is a concept of both oneness and
multiplicity. Therefore, the intention of distinguishing between self-reliance
and dependence does not lead to a contradiction in the same object. Just as the
act of burning, etc., is attributed to fire as the doer, etc., so should it be
understood in this case.  **7. Doubt:** In the sutra, it is appropriate to first
consider knowledge, because perception is preceded by knowledge, and the word
"knowledge" has fewer syllables than the word "perception."  **Resolution:** It
is not appropriate to say that perception is preceded by knowledge, and
therefore knowledge should be considered first in the sutra, because perception
and knowledge arise simultaneously. Just as the brilliance and light of the sun
are revealed simultaneously when the cloud cover disappears, so too, when the
suppression, destruction, or suppression of destruction of the obscurations of
perception occurs, the soul manifests as right perception, and at the same time,
the elimination of wrong knowledge and scriptural knowledge, and right knowledge
and scriptural knowledge are revealed. Secondly, there is a rule that in a
sutra, the word with fewer syllables is placed before the word with more
syllables. Therefore, the word "perception" is placed before the word
"knowledge."  **Doubt:** Why is right perception considered more important?
**Resolution:** Because right perception is the cause of the correct designation
of knowledge. Conduct is preceded by knowledge, because conduct is preceded by
knowledge.

## The Liberation of All (Sarvarthasiddhi)  **[112 88$8.** Liberation is the
complete detachment from all karmas. The path to attain it is called the path.
The singular form 'path' is used to indicate that all paths together constitute
the path to liberation. This eliminates the possibility of individual paths
leading to liberation. Therefore, right faith (samyakdarshan), right knowledge
(samyakgyan), and right conduct (samyakcharitra) together constitute the direct
path to liberation. - **8 9.** To explain the characteristics of right faith,
which was mentioned earlier, the following is stated:  **Faith in the true
nature of things is right faith. ||2||**  **$10.** The word 'tattva' (true
nature) refers to the general nature of things. How? The word 'tat' (that) is a
pronoun, and pronouns refer to general things. The nature of 'tat' is 'tattva'.
What is 'tat'? It means the state of being as it is.

## Chapter One: The Meaning of Tattvartha  **112 (12)**  The meaning of the word
"Tattvartha" is established as follows: "Tattvena arthaḥ tattvarthaḥ"
(Tattvartha is the meaning of the truth). Alternatively, it can be understood as
"bhaavena bhaavavato'bhidhaanam" (the expression of the essence through the
essence itself), as the essence is inseparable from the essence. Therefore,
"tattvameva arthaḥ tattvarthaḥ" (the truth itself is the meaning of the truth).
The faith in Tattvartha is called "Tattvartha-shraddhaan" and it is to be
understood as "samyag-darshan" (right perception). The Tattvartha, which will be
discussed further, includes the soul (jiva) and other entities.  **11.**
**Doubt:** Since the word "darshan" is derived from the root "drish" which means
"light," how can it be used to denote faith?  **Resolution:** Roots have
multiple meanings. Therefore, there is no fault in interpreting the root "drish"
as "shraddhaan" (faith).  **Doubt:** Why is the common meaning of "drish"
(light) abandoned here?  **Resolution:** Because this is a discussion of the
path to liberation (moksha). Faith in Tattvartha is a transformation of the soul
and is considered a means to liberation, as it is found only in the worthy souls
(bhavyas). Light, however, is caused by the eyes and other senses, and is common
to all beings in the cycle of birth and death. Therefore, it is not appropriate
to consider it as the path to liberation.  **12.**  **Doubt:** Would it be
sufficient to simply say "artha-shraddhaan" (faith in meaning) in the sutra?
**Resolution:** This would lead to the inclusion of all meanings of the word
"artha," such as wealth, purpose, and object of expression, which is not
appropriate. Therefore, the sutra does not simply say "artha-shraddhaan."
**Doubt:** Should we then only accept "tattva-shraddhaan" (faith in truth)?
**Resolution:** This would lead to the inclusion of only the essence. Some
(Vaisheshikas) interpret the word "tattva" as encompassing existence, substance,
quality, and action. If the sutra were to only say "tattva-shraddhaan," it would
imply that faith in all these aspects constitutes right perception, which is not
correct. Alternatively, the word "tattva" can be interpreted as signifying
oneness. In this case, the sutra would imply that accepting everything as one is
right perception. Some have even argued that "purusha eva idam sarvam" (the soul
is everything). However, this contradicts both perception and inference.
Therefore, to avoid these contradictions, the sutra uses both "tattva" and
"artha."  Right perception is of two types: **saraga samyag-darshan** (right
perception with attachment) and **vitaraaga samyag-darshan** (right perception
without attachment). The first is characterized by calmness, emotions,

## 8] **Sarvarthasiddhi** [112 12-  **Srag Samyagdarshan** is characterized by
the expression of compassion, faith, etc., while **Vitrag Samyagdarshan** is the
pure state of the soul.  **Special Meaning:** This sutra, while pointing out the
characteristics of Samyagdarshan, explains that Samyagdarshan is the belief in
the substances like the soul, etc. While explaining this sutra, the commentary
mainly clarifies four points. These four points are: (1) How the word
"Tattvarth" is derived by pointing out the etymological meaning of the words
"Tattva" and "Artha"? (2) Why is the meaning of the root "Drish" taken as
"belief"? (3) What is the benefit of accepting both the words "Tattva" and
"Artha"? (4) How many types of Samyagdarshan are there and what is their nature?
Although "Tat" is a pronoun in the original text and the suffix "Tva" is used in
the sense of "state", the word "Tattva" refers to the general state, and the
word "Artha" refers to the substance. However, the word "Artha" has many
meanings like wealth, purpose, meaning, cessation, subject, type, and object,
etc. Therefore, believing in all these cannot be called Samyagdarshan. That is
why the sutrakar has not included only the word "Artha" in the sutra. Similarly,
the word "Tattva" has many meanings in different schools of thought. Vaisheshika
people take "Tattva" as existence, substance, quality, and action. In their
view, both general and particular are considered independent substances. Now, if
only the word "Tattva" is included in the sutra, then believing in existence,
substance, quality, and action can also be considered Samyagdarshan, which is
not appropriate. Therefore, the sutrakar has not included only the word "Tattva"
in the sutra. Similarly, the Parambrahmavadis have not accepted various tattvas
but have considered only one tattva called Brahma. According to their view, this
world is only in the form of a person. Therefore, considering this, the word
"Tattva" becomes the word for one Brahma, which is not appropriate. Therefore,
the sutrakar has not included only the word "Tattva" in the sutra. Here, all
those substances like the soul, etc., are taken from Tattvartha, which are
described in the fourth sutra. The meaning of this sutra is that believing in
the ultimate reality is Samyagdarshan.  The word "Darshan" is used in
Samyagdarshan. One meaning of it is "light". However, here its meaning is taken
as "belief" because if the meaning of "Darshan" is taken as "light", then it is
obtained by all beings due to the eye, etc., which is not appropriate in the
original text. But the belief in self-interest is found only in some near-
liberated beings, which is useful in the original text. Therefore, here the
meaning of "Darshan" is not taken as "light" but as "belief". The intention is
that the soul, which is one, undivided, and eternal in three times, is being
manifested in the nine substances like the soul, etc. Therefore, the experience
of this own soul is Samyagdarshan. Every soul is itself the nature of knowledge.
Therefore, the experience of knowledge is the experience of the soul, and that
is Samyagdarshan. This is the meaning.  Therefore, the two types of
Samyagdarshan that have been mentioned - one is Srag Samyagdarshan and the other
is Vitrag Samyagdarshan - are such things as calmness, emotion, compassion, and
faith, which are indicative of the ultimate reality of Samyagdarshan, which is
the purity of the soul. Therefore, from this perspective, they are also
Samyagdarshan in practice. But those who know this as the ultimate reality are
mistaken. The rule is that all those things that are synonymous with
Samyagdarshan, etc., are self-evident, eternal, infinite, and always shining due
to karma, and they arise only from the soul, which is the source of their own
use. That is why, in error, the nature-synonymous Samyagdarshan has been called
only the purity of the soul, because it does not occur in the rise of karma like
falsehood, etc., but only when they are calmed, destroyed, and destroyed. It is
certain that this Samyagdarshan is also found in the fourth and other
gunasthanas. Therefore, the feelings of calmness, etc., which are dependent on
its existence, are...

## Chapter 1: 13. How does the right faith, which is the subject of the nature
of the soul and its calamities, arise?  **The Sutra says:**  It arises from
nature and from learning. ||3||  **Explanation:**  14. Nature means inherent
disposition, and learning means understanding of the objects. The Sutra
indicates both of these as causes.   **Question:** What is the action for which
these two are indicated as causes?  **Answer:** The action is "arises". Although
it is not explicitly mentioned in the Sutra, it should be understood, as Sutras
are always implied.   Therefore, the meaning of this Sutra is that right faith
arises from nature and from learning.  15. **Question:** Does knowledge of
objects arise in right faith born of nature? If it does, then it is also born of
learning, and there is no difference. If it does not, then how can one have
faith in objects without knowing them?  **Answer:** This is not a fault, because
the inner cause, which is the cessation, destruction, or cessation of
destruction of the obscurations of right faith, is the same in both types of
right faith.   What arises without external instruction is natural right faith,
and what arises with external instruction, as a result of knowing the soul and
other objects, is right faith born of learning. This is the difference between
the two.  16. **Question:** Why is the word "that" used in the Sutra?
**Answer:** The word "that" is used to refer to right faith, which was mentioned
in the previous Sutra.

[10] It is specified in *Sarvarthasiddhi*. Otherwise, the path of liberation
would also be included, as it is related to it. But if it is argued that "the
injunction or prohibition applies to the immediately preceding [statement]" and
thus the understanding of right faith is established, then it is not so, because
"the proximate is stronger than the distant" and thus the path of liberation
would be included. Therefore, the word "that" is used. 17. Right faith is said
to be the belief in the true meaning of the principles. Now, what are those
principles? This is what the following sutra says: The principles are: life,
non-life, inflow, bondage, restraint, outflow, and liberation. ||4|| This is
what it means. In the preceding sutra, only right faith is mentioned, and it is
referred to here by the word "that". If the word "that" were not used, then the
path of liberation would be included, as it is the subject matter. The doubt is:
"According to the rule that the injunction or prohibition applies to the
immediately preceding [statement]", the understanding of right faith mentioned
in the preceding sutra is self-evident, so there is no need to use the word
"that" in the sutra. The solution is: No, because according to the rule "the
proximate is stronger than the distant", the path of liberation would be
included here. But this is not desirable, therefore the word "that" is used in
the sutra. Special Meaning - This sutra discusses the causes of the origin of
right faith. In the scriptures, one of the five attainments is mentioned as the
attainment of preaching. A being who has never accepted the teachings about life
and non-life, etc., in the present or past life, with understanding, cannot
attain right faith. But a being who has become eligible for such teachings can
attain right faith either immediately or later. Here, two types of right faith
are mentioned in this regard. The right faith that arises from teachings in the
present is called acquired right faith, and the right faith that arises without
teachings in the present is called innate right faith. This is the meaning of
this sutra. Although the word "acquisition" means knowledge, in this context, it
should be understood as knowledge acquired through teachings. From this, the
meaning of the word "innate" becomes "without teachings". Although the inner
cause of both these right faiths is the same, namely the cessation, destruction,
or cessation-destruction of the obscurations of perception, there is a
difference between them in terms of external teachings and non-teachings. Here,
the doubt arises: Since the right faith of destruction occurs only at the feet
of the Kevali and the Shruta Kevali, then only the acquired type of right faith
can occur in it, not the innate type. Then why is it that the commentary
mentions destruction along with cessation and cessation-destruction when
referring to the inner causes? The solution to this doubt is that a being who
comes from the second and third hells and becomes a Tirthankara does not need
teachings to attain the right faith of destruction, but it is seen that they
attain the right faith of destruction without teachings. Therefore, even in the
right faith of destruction, there are two types: innate and acquired. This is
why the text mentions two types of each of the three types of right faith:
innate and acquired. 817 It has been said earlier that believing in life and
non-life, etc., is right faith. Now, the following sutra tells us what the
principles are: Life, non-life, inflow, bondage, restraint, outflow, and
liberation are the principles. ||4|| 1. "The injunction or prohibition applies
to the immediately preceding [statement]." Pa. Ma. Bha. p. 335. Pari. She. p.

## Chapter 1  **§ 18.**  Here, the characteristic of a *jiva* is consciousness,
which is differentiated into many forms due to the difference in knowledge, etc.
The characteristic of an *ajiva* is the opposite of that of a *jiva*.  *Asrava*
is the form of the door through which good and bad karmas enter.  *Bandha* is
the mutual entry of the regions of the soul and karma.  *Samvara* is the
characteristic of stopping *asrava*.  *Nirjara* is the characteristic of the
destruction of a part of karma.  *Moksha* is the characteristic of the complete
separation of karma from the soul.  The detailed explanation of these will be
discussed later.  Since the result of everything depends on the soul, the *jiva*
is taken first in the sutra.  To show that the *ajiva* is beneficial to the
*jiva*, the *ajiva* is mentioned after the *jiva*.  Since *asrava* is the
subject of both the *jiva* and the *ajiva*, it is taken after both of them.
*Bandha* is preceded by *asrava*, therefore, it is mentioned after *asrava*.
*Samvara* is the opposite of *bandha* because *bandha* does not exist in the
state of *samvara*, therefore, it is mentioned after *bandha* to make this
knowledge clear.  *Nirjara* occurs when *samvara* is present, therefore, it is
mentioned near *samvara*.  *Moksha* is attained in the end, therefore, it is
mentioned at the end.  **§ 19.**  **Doubt:**  Should we include *punya* and
*papa* in the sutra, because other teachers have said that there are nine
substances?  **Solution:**  We should not include *punya* and *papa* because
they are included in *asrava* and *bandha*.  **Doubt:**  If this is the case,
then taking *asrava* etc. separately in the sutra is meaningless because they
are included in *jiva* and *ajiva*.  **Solution:**  Taking *asrava* etc.
separately is not meaningless because the topic here is *moksha*.  Therefore, it
is necessary to mention it.  It is preceded by *samsara*, and the main cause of
*samsara* is *asrava* and *bandha*, while the main cause of *moksha* is
*samvara* and *nirjara*.  Therefore, separate instructions are given to show the
main cause, the cause of the cause, and their results.  It is also seen that
even if something specific is included in the general, it is taken separately
according to the purpose.  For example, "The Kshatriyas have arrived, and
Suravarma is also there."  Here, although Suravarma is included in the
Kshatriyas, he is taken separately according to the purpose.  Similarly, it
should be understood in the present context.  1. *Jiva*.  It is also *asrava*,
etc. 2.  *Viprāyoga* is *moksha*.  *Mancha* is *kat* - *moksha*. 1. 5.
*Kundakunda* etc. 16.  3.  Therefore, *samvara* is *asrava*, etc. 1, etc. 2.
*A*.  4.  *Vyam* is *yora* - *moksha*. 17.  *Shasya* is *yathopayogam* *pritha*
- *moksha*.

## 12] **Sarvarthasiddhi** [114 § 20 8 20. It has been stated that the word
'tattva' is a noun of quality. How can it be in the same grammatical case as the
nouns of substance like 'jiva' etc.?  The answer is that there is no separation
between the substance and the quality, and the substance is attributed to the
quality. For example, in the statement "Use is the soul", the word 'use' is a
noun of quality and the word 'soul' is a noun of substance, and they are in the
same grammatical case. Similarly, it should be understood in the present
context.   **Question:** If this is the case, then the gender and number of the
qualifier will be the same as that of the qualified?   **Answer:** According to
the rules of grammar, even though there is a relationship between the qualifier
and the qualified, the gender and number that a word has acquired due to its
meaning are not violated. This rule should also be applied to the first sutra.
§ 21. In order to avoid confusion in the use of the words for the aforementioned
things like right faith etc. and the things like 'jiva' etc., the next sutra is
stated.  1. 'The genus which has acquired a gender, having adopted that gender,
continues from its origin to its destruction, and does not abandon its gender.'
Pa. 11212531 Others also say that the words for qualities do not necessarily
follow the gender and number of the substance. Pa. Ma. Bha. 511111591

## Chapter One:  Nomination, Substance, and State  **5.  The placement of name,
substance, and state, in terms of their meaning, correct vision, etc., and the
placement of the soul, etc.**  **22.  A name is a designation given by one's own
will for the purpose of interaction with an object devoid of qualities.  The
establishment of a name is the act of placing it, as in "This is wood-work,
book-work, painting, or writing."  Substance is that which is obtained by
qualities, or that which will be obtained by qualities, or that which will
obtain qualities.  State is the substance marked by the present synonym.  For
example, the term "soul" is placed in four ways:  name-soul, establishment-soul,
substance-soul, and state-soul.  Name-soul is the designation of any being as
"soul" without regard to the quality of life.  Establishment-soul is the
placement of "soul" or "human soul" in writing, etc.  Substance-soul is of two
types:  acquired substance-soul and non-acquired substance-soul.  Acquired
substance-soul is the soul that is not useful for the knowledge of the soul or
the knowledge of the human soul, even though it has been acquired.  Non-acquired
substance-soul is of three types:  knower-body, future, and other than these.
The knower-body is the body of the knower, which is present in all three times.
There is no non-acquired future-soul in relation to the general, because the
general life is always present.  However, there is a non-acquired future-soul in
relation to the particular.  The soul that is established in another motion, and
is facing the attainment of human existence, is called the future-human-soul.
Other than this, there are two types:  karma and non-karma.  State-soul is of
two types:  acquired state-soul and non-acquired state-soul.  Acquired state-
soul is the soul that is equipped with the knowledge of the soul or the
knowledge of the human soul, and is useful for it.  Non-acquired state-soul is
the soul that is equipped with the synonym of life or the synonym of human life.
Similarly, the rules of placement of name, etc., should be applied to other
substances.  What is the purpose of this?  To negate the irrelevant.**

## 14] **Sarvarthasiddhi** [115 § 23 For the elucidation of the subject matter,
the meaning of the word is presented through the method of *nikshepa*. Why is
the word 'tat' used? It is used to encompass everything. If the word 'tat' were
not used, then only the primary things like *samyagdarshana* would be connected
with the *nyasa*, and not the secondary things like *jiva* etc. which are
included in the subject matter. But when the word 'tat' is used, then by its
power, the inclusion of both primary and secondary things is established. 8 23.
How is the knowledge of the subject matter, which is presented through names
etc., obtained? This is explained: Knowledge is obtained through *pramana* and
*naya*. 11611 24. The essence of *jiva* etc., which are included through the
method of *nikshepa* of names etc., is understood through *pramana* and *naya*.
*Jiva* is called so. Similarly, the *nikshepa* method of names etc. should be
applied to other substances like *ajiva* etc. **Doubt:** Why is the *nikshepa*
method mentioned? **Solution:** It is mentioned to refute the non-subject matter
and to elucidate the subject matter. The meaning is that the *nikshepa* method
explains in detail the meaning of each word in the subject matter. **Doubt:**
Why is the word 'tat' used in the sutra? **Solution:** The word 'tat' is used in
the sutra to encompass everything. If the word 'tat' were not used in the sutra,
then only the primary things like *samyagdarshana* would be connected with the
*nyasa*. The secondary things like *jiva* etc., which are included in the
subject matter of *samyagdarshana* etc., would not be connected with the
*nyasa*. But when the word 'tat' is used in the sutra, then by its power, the
inclusion of both primary and secondary things is established. **Special
Meaning:** The word *nikshepa* is formed from the root *kṣip* with the prefix
*ni*. The meaning of *nikshepa* is 'to place'. The word *nyasa* also has the
same meaning. The idea is that each word is used in many different meanings in
the world and in the scriptures, depending on the context. The *nikshepa* method
is meant to explain where and in what sense each word is used. Although there
can be many different types of *nikshepa* according to need, various types are
mentioned in the scriptures. But here, four main types are mentioned: name,
establishment, substance, and feeling. Their characteristics and examples are
explained in the commentary. The idea is that just as the commentary explains
the different meanings of the word *jiva* in relation to name *nikshepa*,
establishment *nikshepa*, substance *nikshepa*, and feeling *nikshepa*,
similarly, each word has a different meaning according to the *nikshepa* method
of names etc. This refutes the non-subject matter meaning and establishes the
subject matter meaning, which prevents any confusion in practice. This allows
both the speaker and the listener to understand each other's intentions clearly.
Knowledge of this method is essential for understanding the heart of the text.
It is considered very important in the Jain tradition. Keeping this in mind, the
nature of *nikshepa* is explained here, along with its different types. 23. This
way, the knowledge of the nature of *jiva* etc. and *samyagdarshana* etc., which
are obtained through the expansion by names etc., is explained by the next
sutra: Knowledge of substances is obtained through *pramana* and *naya*. ||6||
24. The essence of the substances like *jiva* etc., whose names etc. are
explained in detail through the *nikshepa* method, is understood through
*pramana* and *naya*. 1. - Without the word 'name', it is not possible. 2. The
essence is from *pramana* and *naya*. And it is understood through *abhigata*,
*di*, 1, *di*, 21.

## Chapter 1  [15 The characteristics and distinctions of the principles (naya)
will be explained. There are two types of principles: self-interest (svartha)
and other-interest (parartha). Self-interest principles are like scripture
(shruta). Scripture, in turn, can be both self-interest and other-interest.
Self-interest is knowledge-based, while other-interest is word-based. These
distinctions are the principles (naya).  Here it is said: "Due to the fewer
letters in the word 'naya', it should come before 'pramana' in the sutra." This
is not a fault. The principle of 'pramana' being superior, it comes first.
Superiority is always stronger. Why is 'pramana' superior? Because the formation
of the principles (naya) originates from 'pramana'. Thus, it is said: "The
determination of meaning through a specific conclusion based on 'pramana' is
'naya'."  'Pramana' encompasses all subjects. It is said: "All subjects are
under the purview of 'pramana', while specific subjects are under the purview of
'naya'."  There are two types of 'naya': 'dravya-arthika' and 'paryaya-arthika'.
The 'paryaya-arthika' naya is used to understand the essence of 'bhavana'. The
other three are understood through the 'dravya-arthika' naya, as it is the
general form. 'Dravya' is the object, and its purpose is 'dravya-arthika'.
'Paryaya' is the object, and its purpose is 'paryaya-arthika'. All of this is to
be understood through 'pramana'.  Their nature is known through both 'pramana'
and the various 'naya'. The characteristics and distinctions of 'pramana' and
'naya' will be explained later. There are two types of 'pramana': self-interest
and other-interest. All knowledge except scriptural knowledge is self-interest
'pramana'. However, scriptural knowledge is both self-interest and other-
interest. Knowledge-based 'pramana' is called self-interest 'pramana', and word-
based 'pramana' is called other-interest 'pramana'. Their distinctions are the
'naya'.  Doubt: The word 'naya' has fewer letters, so shouldn't it be placed
first in the sutra?  Solution: This is not a fault, because 'pramana' is
superior, hence it is placed first. The rule is that 'superiority is always
stronger'.  Doubt: Why is 'pramana' superior?  Solution: Because the formation
of the principles (naya) originates from 'pramana', hence 'pramana' is superior.
The scriptures say: "To know an object through 'pramana' and then determine its
nature through a specific state is 'naya'."  Secondly, 'pramana' encompasses all
subjects. The scriptures say: "All subjects are under the purview of 'pramana',
while specific subjects are under the purview of 'naya'." Therefore, 'pramana'
is superior.  There are two types of 'naya': 'dravya-arthika' and 'paryaya-
arthika'. The 'paryaya-arthika' naya is concerned with the essence of 'bhavana',
while the other three are understood through the 'dravya-arthika' naya, as it is
the general form. 'Dravya' is the object, and its purpose is 'dravya-arthika'.
'Paryaya' is the object, and its purpose is 'paryaya-arthika'. Both 'dravya' and
'paryaya' are the subjects of 'pramana'.  Special Note: This sutra explains how
knowledge is understood through the distinctions of 'pramana' and 'naya', and
how they are used to understand the nature of the soul (jiva) and other objects.
The commentary highlights four main points: (1) Which type of knowledge, out of
the five types of knowledge, is included in 'pramana' and 'naya'. (2) The reason
for placing the word 'pramana' before 'naya' in the sutra, even though 'naya'
has fewer letters. (3) The consideration of which 'naya' is concerned with which
of the four essences. (4) The discussion of the subject of 'pramana'.  The first
point is clarified by saying that out of the five types of knowledge, only four
are considered as knowledge itself, excluding scriptural knowledge. They are
also devoid of reasoning, hence they are included in 'pramana' knowledge.
However, scriptural knowledge is considered both knowledge and word. It also
involves reasoning, hence it has two distinctions: 'pramana' knowledge and
'naya' knowledge.  Here, one might doubt: Since scriptural knowledge is just
another type of knowledge like the others, why is it considered both knowledge
and word?  The solution is that the scriptural object (dravya) is included in
scripture itself. Therefore, 1. We. Shru-mu. 2. 'Javiya Vayanvaha Taviya Chev

##  **Sarvarthasiddhi**  [117 $ 25$ 25. To demonstrate the alternative means of
attaining the knowledge of the Jiva and other entities, which have been attained
through the means of Pramana, the author says: _From the standpoint of the
establishment of the principle of the means of attaining the knowledge of the
Self, the principle of the means of attaining the knowledge of the Self is
established._ ॥7॥ 826. _Nirdēśa_ is the statement of the nature of something.
_Svāmitva_ is the state of being the master. _Sādhana_ is the cause of the
origin of something. _Adhikaran_ is the substratum or basis. _Sthiti_ is the
duration of time. _Vidhāna_ is the type or difference. In the question, "What is
Samyagdarshana?", the statement, "Samyagdarshana is the faith in the Jiva and
other entities", is called _Nirdēśa_, or the statement of Samyagdarshana through
the use of names, etc., is called _Nirdēśa_. For whom is Samyagdarshana?
Generally, it is for the Jiva. Specifically, according to the interpretation of
the path of motion, for those in hell, there is a sufficient and a partial
remedy for all the earths. For those in the first earth, there is a sufficient
and a partial remedy for those who are sufficient and insufficient. For those in
the animal realm, there is a sufficient and a partial remedy for those who are
sufficient and insufficient.

## Chapter 1: On the Cessation of Karma  **There are three types of knowledge:
क्षायिक (destructive), क्षायोपशमिक (partially destructive), and सम्यग्दर्शन
(right knowledge).**  * **For beings in the realm of hell (नारक), both क्षायिक
and क्षायोपशमिक knowledge exist for those who are पर्याप्तक (worthy) and
अपर्याप्तक (unworthy).** * **For beings in the realm of animals (तिर्यंच),
क्षायिक knowledge does not exist. Only क्षायोपशमिक and सम्यग्दर्शन exist for
पर्याप्तक beings, not for अपर्याप्तक beings.** * **For beings in the human realm
(मनुष्य), both क्षायिक and क्षायोपशमिक knowledge exist for both पर्याप्तक and
अपर्याप्तक beings. Only सम्यग्दर्शन exists for पर्याप्तक beings, not for
अपर्याप्तक beings.** * **For beings in the realm of gods (देव), all three types
of knowledge exist for both पर्याप्तक and अपर्याप्तक beings.** * **How can
अपर्याप्तक gods have सम्यग्दर्शन?**  It is because they have attained the state
of godhood after having experienced the cessation of the four karmic bonds
(चारित्रमोहनीय) in their previous human life. * **For beings in the realms of
भवनवासी, व्यन्तर, and ज्योतिषी gods, as well as for the goddesses in these
realms and those born in the realms of सौधर्म and ऐशान, क्षायिक knowledge does
not exist. Only क्षायोपशमिक and सम्यग्दर्शन exist, and these are only for
पर्याप्तक beings.**  **Knowledge is attained through different paths:**  *
**Through the path of the senses (इन्द्रियानुवादेन), all three types of
knowledge are attained by beings with five senses (पंचेन्द्रिय).** * **Through
the path of the body (कायानुवादेन), all three types of knowledge are attained by
beings with three bodies (त्रसकायिक).** * **Through the path of yoga
(योगानुवादेन), all three types of knowledge are attained by beings who practice
yoga (त्रयाणां योगानां). For beings who do not practice yoga (अयोगिनां), only
क्षायिक knowledge exists.** * **Through the path of the Vedas (वेदानुवादेन), all
three types of knowledge are attained by beings who have knowledge of the Vedas
(त्रिवेदानां). For beings who have lost their knowledge of the Vedas
(अपगतवेदानां), only क्षायोपशमिक and क्षायिक knowledge exist.** * **Through the
path of the passions (कषायानुवादेन), all three types of knowledge are attained
by beings who have four passions (चतुष्कषायाणां). For beings who are free from
passions (अकषायाणां), only क्षायोपशमिक and क्षायिक knowledge exist.**  **In the
realm of hell (नारक), पर्याप्तक beings have both क्षायोपशमिक and सम्यग्दर्शन. In
the first earth (पहली पथिवी), both पर्याप्तक and अपर्याप्तक beings have both
क्षायिक and क्षायोपशमिक knowledge.**  **In the realm of animals (तिर्यंच),
पर्याप्तक beings have सम्यग्दर्शन. Both पर्याप्तक and अपर्याप्तक beings have
both क्षायिक and क्षायोपशमिक knowledge. Animals (तिर्यंचनी) do not have क्षायिक
knowledge. Only पर्याप्तक animals have क्षायोपशमिक and सम्यग्दर्शन, not
अपर्याप्तक animals.**  **In the human realm (मनुष्य), both पर्याप्तक and
अपर्याप्तक beings have both क्षायिक and क्षायोपशमिक knowledge. Only पर्याप्तक
humans have सम्यग्दर्शन, not अपर्याप्तक humans. All three types of knowledge
exist for पर्याप्तक humans, but not for अपर्याप्तक humans.**  **In the realm of
gods (देव), both पर्याप्तक and अपर्याप्तक beings have all three types of
knowledge.**  **It is important to note that the human realm (मनुष्य) is the
realm where the process of destroying karma (क्षपणाप्रारम्भको) begins. This is
why animals (तिर्यक्ष) who are bound by their lifespan (बद्धायुष्को) can only be
reborn as humans (पुरुषेष्वेवोत्पद्यते) and not as female animals
(तिर्यस्त्रीष). This is because female animals (द्रव्यदेवस्त्रीणां) cannot have
क्षायिक knowledge.**  **Therefore, it is understood that अपर्याप्तक animals
(तिर्यंचामप्यपर्याप्तकानां) have क्षायोपशमिक knowledge, but not पर्याप्तक
animals.**  **The क्षायिक knowledge is attained through the knowledge of the
soul (भाववेदेन).**  **The realm of gods (देव) is generally considered to be a
realm of liberation (देवा-मु).**  **However, there are specific exceptions, such
as the realms of भवनवासी, व्यन्तर, and ज्योतिषी gods (भवन-म).**

Chhedopasthapanasanyata beings have all three Samyagdarshan, but
Pariharavishuddhisanyata beings do not have Aupshamik Samyagdarshan, they have

but beings with Kevaldarshan have only one Kshayik Samyagdarshan.**  **According
to the translation of Leshyamarg, beings with all six Leshyas have all three

**According to the translation of Bhavyamarg, Bhavy beings have all three

knowledge.**  **According to the translation of Sanjnamarg, Sanji beings have
all three Samyagdarshan, Asanji beings do not have any Samyagdarshan, and beings
without this Sanjna have only one Kshayik Samyagdarshan.**  **According to the
translation of Aahaaramarg, Aahaarak beings have all three Samyagdarshan,
Anaahaarak Chhadmastha beings also have all three Samyagdarshan, but
Samudghatanat Kevali Anaahaarak beings have only one Kshayik Samyagdarshan.**
**Special Note:**  There have been two ancient traditions of discussing the
essence of things - one tradition using six authorities like Nirdesha, etc., and
another tradition using eight authorities like Sada, etc. Here, the author of
Tattvarthasutra, Grdhpiच्छ Acharya, has indicated these two traditions in the
7th and 6th sutras. Here, in the commentary, the nature of Nirdesha, etc., is
explained and Samyagdarshan is considered through them. Even in that, to
understand the meaning of what is said in relation to ownership, it seems
necessary to mention the main context here. Keeping these things in mind helps
in determining which Samyagdarshan occurs where and in what state in the four
gatis. These things are: 1. The proponent of Kshayik Samyagdarshan is the human
being in the Karmabhumika. But such a being, after becoming a Kritakrityavedak
Samyagdristi or Kshayik Samyagdristi, can be born in all four gatis after death.
2. In hell, the said being first goes to the first hell. No Samyagdristi is born
in the other hells after death. 3. In the Tiryancha and humans, the said being
is born in the superior Bhogbhumika, in the Purushavedi Tiryancha and humans. 1.

-1178281 Chapter One [19 8 28. There are two types of means: internal and
external. Internal means is the cessation, destruction, or destruction-cessation
of the obscuration of knowledge. External means is as follows: For those in
hell, before the fourth hell, i.e., up to the third hell, *samyagdarshan* arises
from *jati-smarana* for some, *dharma-shravana* for some, and *vedana-abhibhava*
for some. From the fourth to the seventh hell, *samyagdarshan* arises from
*jati-smarana* for some and *vedana-abhibhava* for some. For those in the animal
realm, *samyagdarshan* arises from *jati-smarana* for some, *dharma-shravana*
for some, and *jina-bimba-darshan* for some. The same should be understood for
humans. For those in the heaven realm, *samyagdarshan* arises from *jati-
smarana* for some, *dharma-shravana* for some, *jina-mahima-darshan* for some,
and *deva-ridhi-darshan* for some. This arrangement should be understood up to
the *anata* kalpa. In the *anata*, *pranata*, *aran*, and *achyuta* kalpas, the
three means other than *deva-ridhi-darshan* are found for the gods. For those
who reside in the nine *praiveyaka* heavens, *samyagdarshan* arises from *jati-
smarana* for some and *dharma-shravana* for some. This is the explanation for
those who reside in the *anudi-sha-anuttara-vimana*. 4. No *samyagdarshan* being
is born in the female womb of the animal, human, or heaven realms after death.
5. No *samyagdarshan* being is born in the three *bhavana* realms after death.
6. A *samyagdarshan* being with *upashama* is born only in the heaven realm
after death. Even then, only a *samyagdarshan* being with *upashama* who is in
the *upashama* category can die, not others. 7. A *samyagdarshan* being with
*kritya-kritya-vedaka* is a type of *samyagdarshan* being with *kshaya-
upashama*. Other than this, *samyagdarshan* beings with *kshaya-upashama* are
born only in the heaven and human realms after death, not in the hell or animal
realms. If such beings are in the animal or human realms, they are born in the
heaven realm. If they are in the hell or heaven realms, they are born in the
human realm. 8. A *samyagdarshan* being with *kshayika* or *kritya-kritya-
vedaka* is born in the *napumsaka* womb after death. Even then, it is born only
in the *nasaka* womb of the first hell. It is not born in the *napumsaka* womb
of the human or animal realms. These are the things that should be kept in mind
to know which *samyagdarshan* is found in which state of beings in which realm.
This is clearly mentioned in the original commentary. One more thing seems
necessary to mention, which is that although the realms are divided according to
the *bhaava-vedika* category in the *margana* due to the *avantara-bheda-karan-
anuyoga*, not the *dravya-vedika* category, therefore, the *bhaava-vedika*
females are considered here. However, it is known from other evidence that a
*samyagdarshan* being is not born in the *dravya* female womb after death. Thus,
we have considered which *samyagdarshan* is found in which state of beings in
which realm. It is easy to consider how many *samyagdarshan* beings are found in
which *margana* and where they are not found, therefore, we have not explicitly
mentioned it here. Only in the *manas-paryaya-jnana*, the existence of a
*samyagdarshan* being with *upashama* should be known in relation to a
*samyagdarshan* being with the second *upashama*. 28. There are two types of
means: internal and external. The cessation, destruction, or destruction-
cessation of the obscuration of knowledge is the internal means. The external
means is as follows: For those in hell, before the fourth hell, i.e., up to the
third hell, *samyagdarshan* arises from *jati-smarana* for some, *dharma-
shravana* for some, and *vedana-abhibhava* for some. From the fourth to the
seventh hell, *samyagdarshan* arises from *jati-smarana* for some and *vedana-
abhibhava* for some. For those in the animal realm, *samyagdarshan* arises from
*jati-smarana* for some, *dharma-shravana* for some, and *jina-bimba-darshan*
for some. The same should be understood for humans. For those in the heaven
realm, *samyagdarshan* arises from *jati-smarana* for some, *dharma-shravana*
for some, *jina-mahima-darshan* for some, and *deva-ridhi-darshan* for some.
This arrangement should be understood up to the *anata* kalpa. In the *anata*,
*pranata*, *aran*, and *achyuta* kalpas, the three means other than *deva-ridhi-
darshan* are found for the gods. For those who reside in the nine *praiveyaka*
heavens, *samyagdarshan* arises from *jati-smarana* for some and *dharma-
shravana* for some. 1. According to this rule, in the *jiva-kanda*, the verse
"हेट्ठिमछप्पुढवीणं" etc., along with the reading "सव्वइत्थीणं", the reading
"संढइत्थीणं" should also be understood.

## 20] Sarvarthasiddhi  [1178 29] It is not possible; because the origin of
those who have already attained Samyaktvā is not possible there. 8 29. The
Adhikaraṇa is of two types - internal and external. The internal Adhikaraṇa is
the one whose owner is the Samyakdarshan. For example, the soul, which is the
agent of the action, is the internal Adhikaraṇa. The external Adhikaraṇa is the
Lokanāḍī. How big is it? It is one rajju wide and fourteen rajju long. 6 30. The
lowest and highest duration of the Aupaśamika Samyakdarshan is one Antarmūhūrta.
The lowest duration of the Ksāyika Samyakdarshan for a Samsārī Jīva is one
Antarmūhūrta, and the highest duration is thirty-three sāgaropam, two purvakoti
more, minus eight years and one Antarmūhūrta. The duration for a Mukta Jīva is
infinite. The lowest duration of the Ksāyopaśamika Samyakdarshan is one
Antarmūhūrta, and the highest duration is sixty-six sāgaropam. Some attain Jāti-
smaraṇa (recollection of birth) and some attain Dharma-śravaṇa (hearing of
Dharma). The Devas residing in the Anudiś and Anuttaravimāna do not have this
possibility, because only Jīvas with Samyakdṛṣṭi are born there. $29. Adhikaraṇa
is of two types—internal and external. Internal Adhikaraṇa—the one whose owner
is the Samyakdarshan is its internal Adhikaraṇa. Although the sixth case ending
is used for the owner and the seventh case ending is used for the Adhikaraṇa,
still, according to the intention, the case ending of the agent is used.
Therefore, by using the seventh case ending instead of the sixth case ending,
which was used to describe the ownership, the Adhikaraṇa is described. The
external Adhikaraṇa is the Lokanāḍī. Doubt—How big is it? Solution—It is one
rajju wide and fourteen rajju long. 30. The lowest and highest duration of the
Aupaśamika Samyakdarshan is one Antarmūhūrta. The lowest duration of the Ksāyika
Samyakdarshan for a Samsārī Jīva is one Antarmūhūrta, and the highest duration
is thirty-three sāgaropam, two purvakoti more, minus eight years and one
Antarmūhūrta. The duration for a Mukta Jīva is infinite. The lowest duration of
the Ksāyopaśamika Samyakdarshan is one Antarmūhūrta, and the highest duration is
sixty-six sāgaropam. 1. The Ksāyika Samyakdṛṣṭi attains liberation in the same
birth, the third birth, or the fourth birth. The one who attains liberation in
the fourth birth, first takes birth in the Maugbhūmi, then in the Deva Paryāya,
and finally as a human being, and then attains liberation. The one who attains
liberation in the third birth, first takes birth in the Naraka or Deva Paryāya,
and finally as a human being, and then attains liberation. Here, the birth of
the Ksāyika Samyakdarshan in the third and fourth births has also been included.
This highest duration of the Ksāyika Samyakdarshan for a Samsārī Jīva has been
described in relation to three births. The first and last two births are for the
human Paryāya, and the second birth is for the Deva Paryāya. The highest
duration of these three births is thirty-three sāgaropam, two purvakoti more.
But the attainment of the Ksāyika Samyakdarshan cannot happen before eight years
and one Antarmūhūrta, therefore, subtracting that time from the above-mentioned
time, the highest duration of the Ksāyika Samyakdarshan is described as thirty-
three sāgaropam, two purvakoti more, minus eight years and one Antarmūhūrta. 2.
The highest duration of the Ksāyopaśamika Samyakdarshan in the Khuddābandha is
sixty-six sāgaropam, which is described as follows: A Jīva, having attained the
Vedaka Samyaktvā from the Upasama Samyaktvā, is born in the Devas with a
lifespan of twenty sāgaropam less than the remaining Mujjamāna lifespan. Then,
he is born as a human being, and then again as a Deva with a lifespan of twenty-
two sāgaropam less than the human lifespan. Then, he goes to the human realm and
then is born as a Deva with a lifespan of twenty-four sāgaropam less than the
Mujjamāna human lifespan and the lifespan he enjoyed before the destruction of
Darshanamoha. From there, he again goes to the human realm, and there, when he
is left with one Antarmūhūrta in the time of Vedaka Samyaktvā, he starts the
destruction of Darshanamoha and becomes a Kṛtakṛtya Vedaka Samyakdṛṣṭi. When
this Jīva is in the last stage of Kṛtakṛtya Vedaka, he attains the highest
duration of the Ksāyopaśamika Samyakdarshan, which is sixty-six sāgaropam.

-118833] Chapter One [217 631. Samyakdarshan is one from the general point of
view. It is of two types due to the difference between innate and acquired. It
is of three types due to the difference between auspicious, karmic and karmic-
auspicious. These are the number of options in terms of words. There are
countless and infinite options due to the difference between the believer and
the object of belief. In this way, this method of instruction, etc., should be
applied in knowledge and conduct, and in the living, non-living, etc., according
to the scriptures. 832. Does the knowledge of the living, etc., come from these
alone, or is there another means of knowledge, as it is seen? It is said By
existence, number, field, touch, time, interval, state and less-more. ||8|| 8
33. 'Sat' is an indication of existence. It is used in praise, etc., but is not
taken here. Number is the counting of differences. Field is the residence, the
subject of the present time. The same is touch, which is the object of the three
times. Time is of two types - primary and practical. Their decision will be made
later. Interval is the time of separation. State is the characteristic of
auspicious, etc. Less-more is the special understanding in relation to each
other. By these, the knowledge of Samyakdarshan, etc., and the living, etc.,
should be known. But, the acceptance of 'Sat' is proved by instruction itself.
From the acceptance of the method, the knowledge of number is obtained. From the
acceptance of the subject, the knowledge of field and touch is obtained. From
the acceptance of the state, the collection of time is obtained. The state is
already collected in the name, etc. Why is their acceptance again? It is true
that the acceptance of 'Sat', etc., is proved by instruction, etc., but due to
the intention of the disciple, there is a difference in the explanation of the
truth. Some are interested in brevity, some are interested in detail. Others
831. Samyakdarshan is one in comparison to the general. It is of two types due
to the difference between innate and acquired. It is of three types due to the
difference between auspicious, karmic and karmic-auspicious. In terms of words,
there are countless types, and in terms of believers, there are countless types,
and in terms of objects of belief, there are infinite types. In this way, this
method of instruction, etc., should be applied in knowledge and conduct, and in
the living, non-living, etc., according to the scriptures. 6 32. Does the
knowledge of the living, etc., come from these alone, or are there other means
of knowledge? In this way, when asked, there are other means, it is said in the
next sutra By existence, number, field, touch, time, interval, state and less-
more, the knowledge of Samyakdarshan, etc., is obtained. ||8|| $ 33. 'Sat' is an
indication of existence. It is used in praise, etc., but is not taken here.
Number is the counting of differences. Field is the residence, the subject of
the present time. The same is touch, which is the object of the three times.
Time is of two types - primary and practical. Their decision will be made later.
Interval is the time of separation. State is the characteristic of auspicious,
etc. Less-more is the special understanding in relation to each other. By these,
the knowledge of Samyakdarshan, etc., and the living, etc., should be known.
Doubt - the acceptance of 'Sat' is proved by instruction itself. From the
acceptance of the method, the knowledge of number is obtained. From the
acceptance of the subject, the knowledge of field and touch is obtained. From
the acceptance of the state, the collection of time is obtained. The state is
already collected in the name, etc. Why is their acceptance again? Solution - It
is true that the acceptance of 'Sat', etc., is proved by instruction, etc., but
due to the intention of the disciple, there is a difference in the explanation
of the truth. Some disciples are interested in brevity. Some disciples 1.-Due to
the difference in Rama. And so on. 2.-Country. Praise-Mu. Ta. No. 3. Is
acceptance said? True Ta. No. 4. Some are interested in brevity. Others are not-

## 22] Sarvarthasiddhi  [118834 - Neither too concise nor too elaborate should
the exposition be. For the effort of the virtuous is for the benefit of all
beings, hence the purpose of this exposition of the different means of attaining
knowledge. Otherwise, since "attainment through the means of proof" would
suffice, the inclusion of other means would be pointless.  834. Here, with the
substance of the living being as the subject, an explanation is given through
the doors of the *anuyogins* beginning with *sat*. Living beings are arranged in
fourteen *gunasthanas*. These are: *mithyadrishti*, *sasadan samyagdristi*,
*samyamithyadrishti*, *asanyata samyagdristi*, *sanyatasanyata*,
*pramattasanyata*, *apramattasanyata*, *apuurvakaranasthanavarti* *upshamak* and
*kshapik*, *anivrittibaddarasamprayasthanavarti* *upshamak* and *kshapik*,
*sukshmasamprayasthanavarti* *upshamak* and *kshapik*,
*upshantakashayavitaragchhadmastha*, *kshinakashayavitaragchhadmastha*,
*sayogkevali* and *ayogkevali*. To explain these fourteen *jivasamasas*,
fourteen *marganasthanas* should be known. These are: *gati*, *indriya*, *kaya*,
*yoga*, *veda*, *kashay*, *jnana*, *samyama*, *darshan*, *leshya*, *bhalya*,
*samyaktva*, *sanjna* and *aaharaka*.  35. Of these, the *satprarupana* is of
two types: general and specific. The general *satprarupana* is to say, "There is
*mithyadrishti*, there is *sasadan samyagdristi*, etc." The specific
*satprarupana* is through the *marganasthanas*. In the *narakagati*, in all the
*prithivis*, there are the first four *gunasthanas*. In the *tiryangagati*,
there are those same four *gunasthanas*, but with the addition of the
*sanyatasanyata* *gunasthanas*. In the *manushya gati*, there are all fourteen
*gunasthanas*. In the *devagati*, there are four *gunasthanas* like the
*narakas*. Through the *indriyamargna*, in the *ekendriya* to *chautindriya*
beings, there is only one *mithyadrishti* *gunasthanas*. In the *panchendriya*
beings, there are all fourteen *gunasthanas*. Through the *kayamargna*, in the
*prithivikaya* to *vanaspatikaya* beings, there is only one *mithyadrishti*
*gunasthanas*. In the *trasakaya* beings, there are all fourteen *gunasthanas*.
Through the *yogamargna*, in the three *yogas*, there are thirteen
*gunasthanas*. After that is the *ayogkevali* *gunasthanas*.

## Chapter 1  [118840]  **There are 23 Gunasthana (stages of spiritual progress)
in the path of liberation.**  **In the path of those who have abandoned the
Vedas (Apagata Veda), there are six Gunasthana, starting from Anivrittibadar and
ending with Ayogakevali.**  **36. In the path of Kashaya (passions), there are
nine Gunasthana, starting from Mithyadrishti (false belief) and ending with
Anivrittibadar, for the passions of Krodha (anger), Mana (pride), and Maya
(deceit). For the passion of Lobha (greed), there are the same nine Gunasthana,
but with the addition of the Gunasthana of Sukshmasamprayaya (subtle
attachment). The four Gunasthana of Upashantakshaya (subdued passions),
Kshinakshaya (diminished passions), Sayogakevali (liberated with subtle karmas),
and Ayogakevali (liberated without subtle karmas) are free from passions.**
**37. In the path of Jnana (knowledge), there are two Gunasthana, Mithyadrishti
and Sasadan Samyagdristi (right belief with attachment), in the knowledge of
Matyajnana (wrong knowledge), Shrutaajnana (scriptural knowledge), and
Vibhangajnana (discriminative knowledge). There are nine Gunasthana, starting
from Asamyata Samyagdristi (right belief without control) and ending with
Kshinakshaya, in the knowledge of Abhinibodhik Jnana (intuitive knowledge),
Shrutaavadhi Jnana (scriptural and clairvoyance knowledge), and Avadhi Jnana
(clairvoyance knowledge). There are seven Gunasthana, starting from
Pramattasamyata (controlled with distraction) and ending with Kshinakshaya, in
the knowledge of Manahparyaya Jnana (knowledge of mind). There are two
Gunasthana, Sayoga and Ayoga, in the knowledge of Kevalajnana (omniscience).**
**38. In the path of Samyama (self-control), there are Gunasthana starting from
Pramattasamyata and ending with Ayogakevali. The Gunasthana of Samayik Samyata
(controlled by Samayik) and Chhedopasthapanashuddhi Samyata (controlled by
Chhedopasthapanashuddhi) are from Pramattasamyata to Anivritti. The Gunasthana
of Pariharavishuddhi Samyata (controlled by Pariharavishuddhi) are
Pramattasamyata and Apramattasamyata (controlled without distraction). The
Gunasthana of Sukshmasamprayayashuddhi Samyata (controlled by
Sukshmasamprayayashuddhi) is only one, Sukshmasamprayaya. The Gunasthana of
Yathakyata Viharashuddhi Samyata (controlled by Yathakyata Viharashuddhi) are
from Upashantakshaya to Ayogakevali. The Gunasthana of Samyatasamyata
(controlled by Samyatasamyata) is only one, Samyatasamyata. The Gunasthana of
Asamyata (uncontrolled) are the first four Gunasthana.**  **39. In the path of
Darshan (perception), there are twelve Gunasthana, starting from Mithyadrishti
and ending with Kshinakshaya, in the perception of Chakshudarshan (eye
perception) and Achakshudarshan (non-eye perception). There are nine Gunasthana,
starting from Asamyata Samyagdristi and ending with Kshinakshaya, in the
perception of Avadhi Darshan (clairvoyance perception). There are two
Gunasthana, Sayogakevali and Ayogakevali, in the perception of Kevaladarshan
(omniscient perception).**  **40. In the path of Leshya (color), there are nine
Gunasthana, starting from Mithyadrishti and ending with Asamyata Samyagdristi,
in the colors of Krishna (black), Neel (blue), and Kapota (grey).**

##  Translation:  **24]**  **[188 41]** There are infinite number of souls in
Mithyadrishti. There are countless souls in Saasadan Samyagdristi,
Samyamithyadristi, Asanyata Samyagdristi and  Sanyata Asanyata. There are
countless souls in each of these states. The number of souls in Pramatta Sanyata
is equal to the number of Koti (a very large number) of Pruthaktva
(individuality). There are seven Gunasthanas from Mithyadristi to Apramatta
Sanyata in Peet and Padmaleśya. There are thirteen Gunasthanas from Mithyadristi
to Sayogakevali in Shuklaleśya. But Ayogakevali souls are devoid of Leśya.  **[8
41]** There are fourteen Gunasthanas in Bhavyas according to the Bhavyanuvada.
But Abhavyas are found only in the first Gunasthan.  **[8 42]** There are eleven
Gunasthanas from Asanyata Samyagdristi to Ayogakevali in Kshayik Samyaktva
according to the Samyaktvanuvada. There are four Gunasthanas from Asanyata
Samyagdristi to Apramatta Sanyata in Kshayopashamiksamyaktva. There are eight
Gunasthanas from Asanyata Samyagdristi to Upashantakshaya in
Aupashamiksamyaktva. Saasadan Samyagdristi, Samyamithyadristi and Mithyadristi
are found in their respective Gunasthanas.  **[8 43]** There are twelve
Gunasthanas from Mithyadristi to Kshina Kshaya in Sanjnis according to the
Sanjnanuvada. There is only one Gunasthan, Mithyadristi, in Asanjnis. The souls
who are devoid of the term Sanjni and Asanjni are Sayogakevali and Ayogakevali,
respectively.  **[8 44]** There are thirteen Gunasthanas from Mithyadristi to
Sayogakevali in Aharakas according to the Aharanuvada. There are three
Gunasthanas, Mithyadristi, Saasadan Samyagdristi and Asanyata Samyagdristi, in
Anaharakas who have attained the state of Vigrahagatya. Sayogakevali and
Ayogakevali souls who are in the state of Samudghatagata are also Anaharakas.
Siddhas, the Paramesthis, are beyond Gunasthanas. Thus, the explanation of
Satpraropaṇa is complete.  **[8 45]** Now, we will explain the Sankhyapraropana.
It is of two types: general and specific. Generally, there are infinite number
of souls in Mithyadristi. There are countless souls in Saasadan Samyagdristi,
Samyamithyadristi, Asanyata Samyagdristi and Sanyata Asanyata. The number of
souls in Pramatta Sanyata is equal to the number of Koti (a very large number)
of Pruthaktva (individuality). Pruthaktva is a term used in the Agamas.

- [118846] - Chapter One [25] The number of beings in the three realms is from
three to nine. The number of beings who are not heedless and restrained is
countable. The number of beings in the four stages of liberation is one, two, or
three at the beginning, and forty-four at the peak. The number of beings who are
accumulated by their own time is countable. The number of beings in the four
stages of destruction and the non-liberated is one, two, or three at the
beginning, and one hundred and eight at the peak. The number of beings who are
accumulated by their own time is countable. The number of beings in the
liberated is one, two, or three at the beginning, and one hundred and eight at
the peak. The number of beings who are accumulated by their own time is one
hundred thousand. 846. In particular, according to the translation of the path
of motion, in the first earth of the hell realm, the number of beings who are
false-believers is countless, and the number of these realms is countless. In
the second and subsequent earths up to the seventh earth, the number of beings
who are false-believers is countless, and the number of these realms is
countless. This countless number is countless kotis of yojanas. In all the
earths, the number of beings who are right-believers, mixed-believers, and
unrestrained right-believers is countless. In the animal realm, the number of
beings who are false-believers is infinite. The number of beings in each stage
of liberation from right-believers to restrained is countless. In the human
realm, the number of beings who are false-believers is countless, and the number
of these realms is countless. This countless number is countless kotis of
yojanas. The number of beings in each stage of liberation from right-believers
to restrained is countable. The number of beings who are heedless and restrained
is the same as that which has been stated above. In the god realm, the number of
beings who are false-believers is countless. 1. The false-believers in the
animal realm. 2. A realm is a row of sky regions that is seven rajjus long and
one pradesa wide. The number of beings who are false-believers in the first hell
is equal to the number of pradesas in the countless realms of the first hell. 3.
A realm is a square of realms. 4. The number of beings in each of the second and
subsequent hells is equal to the number of yojanas in the countless realms of
the first hell. This number decreases progressively. 5. This number includes the
number of beings who are restrained. 6. The number of beings in each stage of
liberation from right-believers to restrained is explained in detail in the
commentary on the Tattvartha Sutra by Acharya Umasvati. 7. The number of beings
who are false-believers in the god realm should be understood to be the same as
the number of beings who are false-believers in the first hell. The same should
be understood in the same way for the rest.

samyagdrsti*, *asamyata samyagdrsti* and *ayogakevali*. The *sayogakevali* are

determined. 872. The common field of the *kshayika samyagdrsti* from *asamyata
samyagdrsti* to *ayogakevali* is the same. The common field of the
*kshayopashamika samyagdrsti* from *asamyata samyagdrsti* to *apramatta samyata*

The common field of the *asanjna* is all the worlds. The common field of those
who are neither *sanjna* nor *asanjna* is the same. . The common field of the
*aaharaka* from *mithyadrsti* to *kshinakshaya* is the same. The *sayogakevali*
are an innumerable part of the world. The common field of the *anaaharaka* is
*mithyadrsti*, *sasadan samyagdrsti*, *asamyata samyagdrsti* and *ayogakevali*.
The *sayogakevali* are an innumerable part of the world or all the worlds.
Special Note - In the description of the field, only the present dwelling place
is considered. *Mithyadrsti* beings are found in all the worlds, therefore their
field is considered to be all the worlds. Other *ganasthan* beings are found
only in an innumerable part of the world, therefore their field is considered to
be an innumerable part of the world. Only *sayogikevali* are an exception.
Although the field of the *sayogikevali* in their own place is also an
innumerable part of the world, the *sayogikevali* who perform *samudghata* have
a field of three types. During *samudghata* in the form of *danda* and
*kapaata*, their field is an innumerable part of the world. During *samudghata*
in the form of *pratar*, their field is an innumerable part of the world. During
*samudghata* in the form of *lokapuraka*, their field is all the worlds.
Therefore, their field is described in three ways. When considering the field of
other *margana* like *gati*, etc., this perspective should be kept in mind.
Generally, the field can be understood from these points: 1. Only the
*ekendriya* among the *mithyadrsti* have a field of all the worlds. The rest do
not. There are some sub-categories of them who do not have a field of all the
worlds, but they are not intended here. According to this, all the *margana*
that are possible for the *ekendriya* should be considered to have a field of
all the worlds. For example, in *gati margana*, *tiryanch gati margana*, in
*indriya margana*, *ekendriya margana*, in *kaya-pagana*, *prithvi* etc. five
*sthavara kaya margana*, in *yoga* 1. - *asyasankeyamaga* mu., di. 1, di. 21

## Chapter 1: 8.75. Touch is Explained  Touch is of two types: general and
specific.  **General Touch:**  * **Mithyadrishtis (wrong-believers):** They
touch the entire realm. * **Sasadan Samyagdristis (right-believers with
attachment):** They touch an immeasurable portion of the realm, as well as 8 or
12 out of 14 parts of the Trasanali (the realm of the three worlds). *
**Samyagmithyadrishtis (mixed-believers) and Asanyata Samyagdristis (right-
believers without restraint):** They touch an immeasurable portion of the realm,
as well as 8 out of 14 parts of the Trasanali. * **Sanjata Samyagdristis (right-
believers with restraint):** They touch an immeasurable portion of the realm, as
well as 6 out of 14 parts of the Trasanali.  **Specific Touch:**  * **Kayayoga
(body-yoga):** This becomes the realm of all beings. * **Vedamargana (path of
knowledge):** This becomes the realm of all beings. * **Kasaya Margana (path of
passions):** This becomes the realm of all beings. * **Jnana Margana (path of
knowledge):** This becomes the realm of all beings. * **Samyama Margana (path of
restraint):** This becomes the realm of all beings. * **Darshan Margana (path of
perception):** This becomes the realm of all beings. * **Leshya Margana (path of
subtle bodies):** This becomes the realm of all beings. * **Bhavya Margana (path
of becoming):** This becomes the realm of all beings. * **Samyaktva Margana
(path of right-belief):** This becomes the realm of all beings. * **Sanjna
Margana (path of consciousness):** This becomes the realm of all beings. *
**Ahar Margana (path of food):** This becomes the realm of all beings.
**Specific Touch for Different Beings:**  1. **Sasadan Samyagdristis to Kshina
Kasaya Gunasthanas (right-believers with attachment to those with subtle
passions):** They touch an immeasurable portion of the realm. 2. **Two-sense,
three-sense, four-sense, and five-sense beings without consciousness:** They
touch an immeasurable portion of the realm. 3. **Conscious beings except for
those who are in the state of Samudghata (liberation) with Sayogika Kevalis
(liberated beings with karmic attachments):** They touch an immeasurable portion
of the realm.  **Specific Touch during Samudghata:**  * **During the Samudghata
of Sayogika Kevalis:** All beings touch the realm. * **During the Lokapurana
Samudghata (liberation of the entire realm):** The following Marganas are found:
Manushya Gati (human path), Panchendriya Jati (five-sense beings), Trasakaya
(suffering body), Kayayoga (body-yoga), Apangataved (knowledge without defects),
Akasaya (without passions), Kevaljnana (omniscience), Yathakyata Samyama
(perfect restraint), Keval Darshan (omniscient perception), Shukla Leshya (white
subtle body), Bhavya (becoming), Kshayika Samyaktva (right-belief that is
fading), Na Sanjni Na Asanjni (neither conscious nor unconscious), and Anahar
(without food). * **During the Pratar Samudghata (liberation of the remaining
realm):** An immeasurable portion of the realm is touched.  **Specific Touch for
Different Marganas:**  * **Kayayoga, Bhavya, and Anahar:** These three Marganas
touch the realm during Lokapurana and Pratar Samudghata. * **All other
Marganas:** They touch an immeasurable portion of the realm except during the
above-mentioned states.  **Conclusion:**  This is how the touch of the realm is
determined.

## 36j Sarvarthasiddhi  **[118880] General statement of the touch of the
Ayogakevali and the Sayogakevali.**  **80.**  By the translation of the Vedas,
the *stri-pum-veda* (male and female vedis) with *mithyadristi* (false vision)
have touched an innumerable part of the world, or eight parts out of fourteen,
or less, or the whole world. The *sasadan-samyagdristi* (those who have attained
the right vision) have touched an innumerable part of the world, or eight parts
out of fourteen, or less, or nine parts out of fourteen, or less. The general
statement of the touch of the *samyag-mithyadristi* (those who have attained the
right vision) to the *anivritti-badar* (those who have attained the state of
non-return) is the same. In the *napumsak-veda* (neuter vedis), the general
statement of the touch of the *mithyadristi* and the *sasadan-samyagdristi* is
the same. The *samp-mithyadristi* (those who have attained the right vision)
have touched an innumerable part of the world. The *asanyata-samyagdristi*
(those who have attained the right vision but are not restrained) and the
*sanyata-sanyata* (those who are restrained) have touched an innumerable part of
the world, or six parts out of fourteen, or less. The general statement of the
touch of the *pramatta* (those who are careless) to the *anivritti-badar* (those
who have attained the state of non-return) and those who have abandoned the
Vedas is the same.  **What is the touch of the *Ogh* (stream)?**  The touch of
the *Sayogakevali* (those who have attained the state of liberation) is an
innumerable part of the world. Similarly, the touch of the *Kayayogi* (those who
have attained the state of liberation) from the *mithyadristi* (false vision) to
the *Sayogakevali* (those who have attained the state of liberation) and the
*Ayogakevali* (those who have attained the state of liberation) is the same as
the touch of the *Ogh* (stream).  **6 80.** By the translation of the *Veda-
margana* (the path of the Vedas), the *mithyadristi* (false vision) *stri-vedi*
(female vedis) and *purusha-vedi* (male vedis) have touched an innumerable part
of the world, or eight parts out of fourteen, or less, or the whole world. The
*sasadan-samyagdristi* (those who have attained the right vision) have touched
an innumerable part of the world, or eight parts out of fourteen, or less, or
nine parts out of fourteen, or less. The touch of the *samyag-mithyadristi*
(those who have attained the right vision) to the *dar* (those who have attained
the state of liberation) is the same as the touch of the *Ogh* (stream). In the
*napumsak-veda* (neuter vedis), the touch of the *mithyadristi* (false vision)
and the *sasadan-samyagdristi* (those who have attained the right vision) is the
same as the touch of the *Ogh* (stream). The *samyag-mithyadristi* (those who
have attained the right vision) have touched an innumerable part of the world.
The *asanyata-samyagdristi* (those who have attained the right vision but are
not restrained) and the *sanyata-sanyata* (those who are restrained) have
touched an innumerable part of the world, or six parts out of fourteen, or less.
Similarly, the touch of the *pramatta-sanyata* (those who are careless and
restrained) to the *anivritti-badar* (those who have attained the state of non-
return) is the same as the touch of the *Ogh* (stream).  **1.** *Stri-pum-veda*
(male and female vedis). **2.** Eight, nine, fourteen. **3.** The whole world.
In the *napumsak-veda* (neuter vedis). **4.** The *samyag-mithyadristi* (those
who have attained the right vision) have touched an innumerable part of the
world. The *sasadan-samyagdristi* (those who have attained the right vision)
have touched an innumerable part of the world, or eight parts out of fourteen,
or less, or nine parts out of fourteen, or less. The general statement of the
touch of the *samyag-mithyadristi* (those who have attained the right vision) to
the *anivritti-badar* (those who have attained the state of non-return) is the
same. The *asanyata-samyag* (those who have attained the right vision but are
not restrained). **5.** In the *samudghata* (the time of the great deluge),
there is no *manoyoga* (mental concentration) or *vacanayoga* (verbal
concentration). Therefore, the touch of the *vacanayogi* (those who have
attained verbal concentration) and the *manoyogi* (those who have attained
mental concentration) and the *Sayogakevali* (those who have attained the state
of liberation) is said to be an innumerable part of the world. **6.** Two *raju*
(a unit of measurement) less than the bottom of *Meru* (the mountain) and six
*raju* above. This touch is obtained in relation to the *viharavat-sthana* (the
state of wandering), *vedana* (sensation), *kasaya* (passions), and *vaikriyik*
(the state of change). The touch of the whole world is obtained in relation to
the *maranantik* (the state of death) and the *uppadik* (the state of birth).
**7.** Two *raju* (a unit of measurement) less than the bottom of *Meru* (the
mountain) and six *raju* above. This touch is obtained in relation to the
*viharavat-sthana* (the state of wandering), *vedana* (sensation), *kasaya*
(passions), and *vaikriyik* (the state of change). **8.** Two *raju* (a unit of
measurement) less than the bottom of *Meru* (the mountain) and seven *raju*
above. This touch is obtained in relation to the *maranantik* (the state of
death). Here, the touch of eleven *ghana-raju* (a unit of measurement) is

touch is obtained in relation to *vihara*, *vedana*, *k*ashaya*, and
*vaikriyika* stages, because the *P*ita-Leshya* *S*as*adana* are seen to move in
two *raju* less below and six *raju* above. 2. This touch is obtained in
relation to *maran*antika* *samud*gh*ata*, because such beings are found to
perform *maran*antika* *samud*gh*ata* in nine *raju* less above the third earth.
It should be known here that their touch in relation to the *up*ap*ada* stage is
one and a half *raju* less. 3. This touch is obtained in relation to *vihara*,
*vedana*, *k*ashaya*, *vaikriyika*, and *maran*antika* stages. The reasoning has
already been explained. The special feature is that there is no *maran*antika*
*samud*gh*ata* in the *mishra* *guna-sth*ana*. 4. This touch is obtained in
relation to the *maran*antika* stage. They do not have the *up*ap*ada* stage. 5.
This touch is obtained in relation to *vihara*, *vedana*, *k*ashaya*,
*vaikriyika*, and *maran*antika* stages. Their touch in relation to the
*up*ap*ada* stage is five *raju* less. The special feature is that there is no
*maran*antika* and *up*ap*ada* stage in the *mishra* *guna-sth*ana*. 6. This
touch is obtained in relation to the *maran*antika* stage, because the *Samyata-
Samyata* with *Padma-Leshya* are found to perform *maran*antika* *samud*gh*ata*
in five *raju* less above. 7. This touch is obtained in relation to *vihara*,
*vedana*, *k*ashaya*, *vaikriyika*, and *maran*antika* stages. This statement is
made in relation to the four *guna-sth*ana* from *Mithyadrishti* etc. The
*Samyata-Samyata* with *Shukla-Leshya* obtain touch in relation to *vihara*,
*vedana*, *k*ashaya*, and *vaikriyika* stages only in an immeasurable portion of
the *loka*. The touch of the *Mithyadrishti* and *S*as*adana-Samyagdristi* with
*Shukla-Leshya* in relation to the *up*ap*ada* stage is in an immeasurable
portion of the *loka*. The touch of the *Avirata-Samyagdristi* with *Shukla-
Leshya* is six *raju* less. The *Samyata-Samyata* do not have the *up*ap*ada*
stage. Nevertheless, their touch in relation to *maran*antika* *samud*gh*ata*

## Chapter 1 **886.** The touch of the **bhavyas** (those destined for
liberation) is the same as the **ogha** (stream) from the **pathya** (those who
follow the right path) to the **ayogakevali** (those who have attained
liberation without any effort). The **abhavya** (those who are not destined for
liberation) have touched all beings.  **887.** The touch of the **kshayika
samyagdrsti** (those who have destroyed their karmas) from the **asamyata
samyagdrsti** (those who have not yet attained complete control over their
senses) to the **ayogakevali** is the same as the **ogha**. However, the touch
of the **samyata samyata** (those who have attained complete control over their
senses) is a fraction of the **loka** (universe). The touch of the
**kshayopashamaka samyagdrsti** (those who are on the path of destroying their
karmas) is the same as the **ogha**. The touch of the **asamyata samyagdrsti**
(those who have not yet attained complete control over their senses) is the same
as the **ogha**. The touch of the remaining **opashamaka samyagdrsti** (those
who are on the path of destroying their karmas) is a fraction of the **loka**.
The touch of the **sasadan samyagdrsti** (those who have attained the first
stage of liberation), **sarvagami mithyadrsti** (those who have attained the
highest stage of the wrong path), and **mithyadrsti** (those who are on the
wrong path) is the same as the **ogha**.  **888.** The touch of the **sanjnas**
(those who have attained the knowledge of the self) is the same as the
**chakshudarsana** (those who have attained the vision of the self) beings. The
**asanjnas** (those who have not attained the knowledge of the self) have
touched all beings. The touch of those who are devoid of both these
characteristics is the same as the **ogha**.  **889.** The touch of the
**aharakas** (those who consume food) from the **mithyadrsti** to the
**kshinakashaya** (those who have destroyed their karmas) is the same as the
**ogha**. The touch of the **sayogakevali** is a fraction of the **loka**. Among
the **anahakaras** (those who do not consume food), the **mithyadrsti** have
touched all beings. The **sasadan samyagdrsti** have touched a fraction of the
**loka** and eleven out of fourteen parts of the **lokanadi** (the path of the
universe). The **asamyata samyagdrsti** have touched a fraction of the **loka**
and six out of fourteen parts of the **lokanadi**. The **sayogakevali** have
touched a fraction of the **loka** and all beings. The **ayogakevali** have
touched a fraction of the **loka**. This is the explanation of touch.  **890.**
Now we will discuss **kala** (time). It is of two types: **samanya** (general)
and **vishesha** (specific). In general, the **mithyadrsti** has touched all
time in relation to the **ajiva** (non-living beings). In relation to the
**jiva** (living beings), there are three types of time:  1. **Anadi**
(beginningless) and **saryava** (ending) - This is the time from the **meru**
(mountain) to the **tal** (bottom) and above, less than five **raju** (a unit of
measurement) and six **raju** respectively. This touch is attained in relation
to the **uppapada** (birth). 2. **Anadi** (beginningless) and **saryava**
(ending) - This is the time from the **meru** to the **tal** and above, less
than the **achyuta kalpa** (a unit of time). The **tiryanch** (animals) and
**asamyata samyagdrsti** are born in the **achyuta kalpa** after death, so this
touch is attained in relation to the **uppapada**.

## Chapter 1  **For the Mithyadrishti (false-sighted) in the state of Tiryanch
(animal), the time is all time in relation to many beings. In relation to one
being, the least time is an Antarmuhurta (a very short time), and the greatest
time is infinite time, which is equal to countless Pudgala (matter)
transformations. For the Sasadan Samyagdristi (right-sighted with the right
faith), Samyagmithyadristi (right-false-sighted), and the restrained and
unrestrained Tiryanch, the time is the same. For the unrestrained Samyagdristi,
the time is all time in relation to many beings. In relation to one being, the
least time is an Antarmuhurta, and the greatest time is slightly less than the
greatest time mentioned above.**  **For the Mithyadrishti in the state of
Manushya (human), the time is all time in relation to many beings. In relation
to one being, the least time is an Antarmuhurta, and the greatest time is three
Palya (a measure of time) greater than the previous Koti (a measure of time).
For the Sasadan Samyagdristi, the least time in relation to many beings is one
Samaya (a measure of time), and the greatest time is an Antarmuhurta. In
relation to one being, the least time is one Samaya, and the greatest time is
six Avalika (a measure of time). For the Samyagmithyadristi, the time is neither
less nor greater than the Antarmuhurta in relation to both one being and many
beings.**  **For the unrestrained Samyagdristi, the time is all time in relation
to many beings. In relation to one being, the least time is an Antarmuhurta, and
the greatest time is three Palya, slightly greater than the previous Koti.**
**There are some special features:**  1. **In the first six Narakas (hells), the
Mithyadrishti is born with Mithyatva (false-sight), and then after an
Antarmuhurta, they are born with Samyaktva (right-sight) and remain with
Samyaktva for the rest of their life, achieving the greatest time. However, in
the seventh Naraka, both entry and exit are with Mithyatva.** 2. **Here, an
uncountable number of Avalika is taken as an uncountable part.** 3. **Here,
forty-seven previous Koti are taken from the previous Koti.** Although the word
"Prithaktva" indicates a number greater than three and less than nine, here,
forty-seven is taken from the word "Prithaktva" due to the abundance. 4. **Here,
a slightly less than three-part of the previous Koti is taken from the word
"Sadhik".** For example, a human with a lifespan of one Koti who has bound his
lifespan in the three parts, then attains the Kshayik Samyagdarshan (right-
sight) with Samyaktva in the Antarmuhurta and dies at the end of his lifespan
and is born in the best Bhogbhumi (land of enjoyment) with a lifespan of three
Palya, he achieves the greatest time of the uninterrupted Samyagdristi.

## Chapter 1  **For those with diverse living beings, the time is all time, for
those with one living being, the least time is one moment, and the greatest time
is an antarmuhurta. For those with the right view with enjoyment, the general
time is as stated. For those with the right and wrong view, the least time is
one moment, and the greatest time is an uncountable part of a palya. For one
living being, the least time is one moment, and the greatest time is an
antarmuhurta. For the four upshamaka and the four kshapaka, the least time is
one moment for both diverse living beings and one living being, and the greatest
time is an antarmuhurta. For those with the body yoga and the wrong view, the
time is all time for diverse living beings, the least time is one moment for one
living being, and the greatest time is infinite time, which is an uncountable
number of pudgala transformations. The rest are like those with the mind yoga,
and those without yoga are like the general.**  **According to the Vedic
translation, for those with the wrong view in the female Vedas, the time is all
time for diverse living beings, the least time is an antarmuhurta for one living
being, and the greatest time is one hundred palya. The general time is from the
right view with enjoyment to the end of the anivritti badara. But for those with
the unrestrained right view, the time is all time for diverse living beings, the
least time is an antarmuhurta for one living being, and the greatest time is
fifty-five palya less than the country. For those with the wrong view in the
male Vedas, the time is all time for diverse living beings, the least time is an
antarmuhurta for one living being, and the greatest time is one hundred sagara.
The general time is from the right view with enjoyment to the end of the
anivritti badara. For those with the wrong view in the neuter Vedas, the time is
all time for diverse living beings, the least time is an antarmuhurta for one
living being, and the greatest time is one hundred sagara.**  **For the
restrained and unrestrained, the distracted and undistracted, and the
syogikevali, the time is all time for diverse living beings. For one living
being, the least time is one moment, and the greatest time is an antarmuhurta.
The general time is for those with the right view with enjoyment. For those with
the right and wrong view, the least time is one moment for diverse living
beings, and the greatest time is an uncountable part of a palya. For one living
being, the least time is one moment, and the greatest time is an antarmuhurta.
For the four upshamaka and the four kshapaka, the least time is one moment for
both diverse living beings and one living being, and the greatest time is an
antarmuhurta. For those with the body yoga and the wrong view, the time is all
time for diverse living beings, the least time is one moment for one living
being, and the greatest time is infinite time, which is an uncountable number of

The general time is from the right view with enjoyment to the end of the
anivritti badara.**  **1. The least time for mind yoga, speech yoga, and body
yoga is one moment. The yoga paravritti, guna paravritti, death, and vyaghata
are the four types. Of these, the wrong view, the unrestrained right view, the
restrained and unrestrained, and the distracted and undistracted are all four
types possible. For the undistracted and undistracted, only three types are
possible without vyaghata, because vyaghata and the undistracted nature are
mutually exclusive. For the syogikevali, the least time is one moment only with
one yoga paravritti. 2. Without death, the remaining three types can occur here,
and the least time is one moment. 3. Without the vyaghata of the upshamaka,
three types are possible, and without the death and vyaghata of the kshapaka,
two types are possible, and the least time is one moment. 4. The greatest
lifespan of a goddess is fifty-five palya. If we subtract the initial
antarmuhurta time, the greatest time for the unrestrained right view in the
female Vedas is fifty-five palya less. 5. More than three hundred sagara and
less than nine hundred sagara.**

##  **Translation of the Jain Text:**  **441 Sarvarthasiddhi**  **[118898]**  In
relation to all beings, time is infinite. For a single being, the shortest time
is an antarmūhurta (a fraction of a muhūrta, which is 48 minutes). The longest
time is infinite, measured by countless pudgala transformations. This is the
same for all beings from those with sā-sādana samyagdṛṣṭi (right faith with
attachment) to those with anivṛtti-bādar (complete cessation of karma).
**[899]** For those with asamyata samyagdṛṣṭi (right faith without restraint),
time is infinite in relation to all beings. For a single being, the shortest
time is an antarmūhurta. The longest time is less than thirty sāgara (oceans).
This is the same for all beings without vedas (scriptural knowledge).  **[899]**
In relation to the four kṣayās (passions) through kṣayā-anuvāda (the process of
diminishing passions), the time for those with mithyādṛṣṭi (false faith) to
those with apramātta-samyata (perfect restraint) is the same as for those with
manoyoga (mental concentration). The time for the two upaśamaka (passions that
cause suffering), the two kṣapaka (passions that cause destruction), those with
only lobha (greed), and those without kṣayās is the same.  **[8100]** In
relation to knowledge through jñāna-anuvāda (the process of gaining knowledge),
the time for those with matyajñāna (knowledge of death) and śrutājñāna
(knowledge from scriptures) is the same as for those with mithyādṛṣṭi and sā-
sādana samyagdṛṣṭi. For those with vibhaṅga-jñāna (knowledge of the destruction
of karma), time is infinite in relation to all beings. For a single being, the
shortest time is an antarmūhurta. The longest time is less than thirty sāgara.
The time for those with sā-sādana samyagdṛṣṭi is the same. The time for those
with ābhinibodika-jñāna (knowledge of the subtle), śruta-avadhi-jñāna (knowledge
of the past), manaḥ-paryaya-jñāna (knowledge of the mind), and kevala-jñāna
(omniscience) is the same.  **[101]** In relation to restraint through samyamā-
anuvāda (the process of gaining restraint), the time for those with sāmayika-
samyata (restraint through daily meditation), chheda-upasthāpana-samyata
(restraint through the destruction of karma), pariharā-viśuddhi-samyata
(restraint through purification), sūṣma-sāmprāya-samyata (restraint through
subtle practice), yathākhyāta-viśuddhi-samyata (restraint through perfect
purity), samyata-samyata (restraint through restraint), and the four asamyata
(unrestrained) is the same.  **[102]** In relation to perception through
darśana-anuvāda (the process of gaining perception), the time for those with
cakṣu-darśana (visual perception) and mithyādṛṣṭi is infinite in relation to all
beings. For a single being, the shortest time is an antarmūhurta. The longest
time is two thousand sāgara. The time for those with sā-sādana samyagdṛṣṭi and
others with kṣīṇa-kṣayā (diminished passions) is the same.  **[102]** For those
with napuṃsaka-veda (knowledge of the neuter gender), the time for mithyādṛṣṭi
is infinite in relation to all beings. For a single being, the shortest time is
an antarmūhurta. The longest time is infinite, measured by countless pudgala
transformations. This is the same for all beings from those with sā-sādana
samyagdṛṣṭi to those with anivṛtti-bādar. However, for those with asamyata
samyagdṛṣṭi, time is infinite in relation to all beings. For a single being, the
shortest time is an antarmūhurta. The longest time is less than thirty sāgara.
This is the same for all beings without vedas.  **[899]** In relation to the
four kṣayās through kṣayā-anuvāda, the time for those with mithyādṛṣṭi to those
with apramātta-samyata is the same as for those with manoyoga. The time for the
two upaśamaka, the two kṣapaka, those with only lobha, and those without kṣayās
is the same.  **[100]** In relation to knowledge through jñāna-anuvāda, the time
for those with matyajñāna and śrutājñāna is the same as for those with
mithyādṛṣṭi and sā-sādana samyagdṛṣṭi. For those with vibhaṅga-jñāna, time is
infinite in relation to all beings. For a single being, the shortest time is an
antarmūhurta. The longest time is less than thirty sāgara. The time for those
with sā-sādana samyagdṛṣṭi is the same. The time for those with ābhinibodika-
jñāna, śruta-avadhi-jñāna, manaḥ-paryaya-jñāna, and kevala-jñāna is the same.
**[101]** In relation to restraint through samyamā-anuvāda, the time for those

## Chapter 1: General Time Span  **145.** This chapter discusses the general
time span for those who have attained the state of **Kshaya** (exhaustion of
karmas) in the context of **Mithyadrishti** (false belief). The time span for
**Avadhi** (clairvoyance) and **Kevala** (omniscience) is the same as that of
**Avadhijnani** (clairvoyant) and **Kevalajnani** (omniscient) respectively.
**8103.** Based on the **Leshya** (color) classification, for those with
**Mithyadrishti** in the **Krishna**, **Neela**, and **Kapota** Leshyas, the
general time span is as follows:  * **For all beings:** The entire duration of
time. * **For a single being:** The minimum time span is **Antarmuhurta** (a
fraction of a Muhurta). The maximum time span is **33 Sagaropama** (33 times the
size of the ocean), **17 Sagaropama**, and **7 Sagaropama** respectively, all
with an additional **Atirek** (increment).  The general time span for
**Sasaadana** (initial stage of right faith) and **Samyagmithyadrishti** (right
faith with false belief) is the same.  For those with **Asanyata Samyagdristi**
(right faith without restraint), the general time span is as follows:  * **For
all beings:** The entire duration of time. * **For a single being:** The minimum
time span is **Antarmuhurta**. The maximum time span is **33 Sagaropama**, **17
Sagaropama**, and **7 Sagaropama** respectively, all with a **Deshon**
(decrement).  For those with **Mithyadrishti** in the **Peeta** and **Padma**
Leshyas, and those with **Asanyata Samyagdristi**, the general time span is as
follows:  * **For all beings:** The entire duration of time. * **For a single
being:** The minimum time span is **Antarmuhurta**. The maximum time span is **2
Sagaropama** and **18 Sagaropama** respectively, both with an additional
**Atirek**.  The general time span for **Sasaadana Samyagdristi** and
**Samyagmithyadrishti** is the same.  For **Sanyata** (restrained), **Asanyata**
(unrestrained), **Pramatta** (distracted), and **Apramatta** (undistracted)
beings, the general time span is as follows:  * **For all beings:** The entire
duration of time. * **For a single being:** The minimum time span is **Eka
Samaya** (one moment). The maximum time span is **Antarmuhurta**.  For those
with **Mithyadrishti** in the **Shukla** Leshya, the general time span is as
follows:  * **For all beings:** The entire duration of time. * **For a single
being:** The minimum time span is **Antarmuhurta**. The maximum time span is
**31 Sagaropama** with an additional **Atirek**.  The general time span for
**Sasaadana Samyagdristi** to **Sayogakevali** (liberated by association) and
those without **Leshya** is **1000 Sagaropama**. This is the general time span
for each stage from **Sasaadana Samyagdristi** to **Kshaya**. This is also the
general time span for each stage from **Mithyadrishti** to **Kshaya** for those
with **Achakshudarshana** (clairvoyance without eyes). The time span for
**Avadhi** and **Kevala** is the same as that of **Avadhijnani** and
**Kevalajnani** respectively.  **8103.** Based on the **Leshya** classification,
for those with **Mithyadrishti** in the **Krishna**, **Neela**, and **Kapota**
Leshyas, the general time span is as follows:  * **For all beings:** The entire
duration of time. * **For a single being:** The minimum time span is
**Antarmuhurta**. The maximum time span is **33 Sagaropama**, **17 Sagaropama**,
and **7 Sagaropama** respectively, all with an additional **Atirek**.  The
general time span for **Sasaadana Samyagdristi** and **Samyagmithyadrishti** is
the same.  For those with **Asanyata Samyagdristi**, the general time span is as
follows:  * **For all beings:** The entire duration of time. * **For a single
being:** The minimum time span is **Antarmuhurta**. The maximum time span is
**33 Sagaropama**, **17 Sagaropama**, and **7 Sagaropama** respectively, all
with a **Deshon** (decrement).  For those with **Peeta** and **Padma** Leshyas,
and those with **Asanyata Samyagdristi**, the general time span is as follows:
* **For all beings:** The entire duration of time. * **For a single being:** The
minimum time span is **Antarmuhurta**. The maximum time span is **2 Sagaropama**
and **18 Sagaropama** respectively, both with an additional **Atirek**.  The
general time span for **Sasaadana Samyagdristi** and **Samyagmithyadrishti** is
the same.  For **Sanyata** (restrained), **Asanyata** (unrestrained),
**Pramatta** (distracted), and **Apramatta** (undistracted) beings, the general
time span is as follows:  * **For all beings:** The entire duration of time. *
**For a single being:** The minimum time span is **Eka Samaya** (one moment).
The maximum time span is **Antarmuhurta**.  For those with **Mithyadrishti** in
the **Shukla** Leshya, the general time span is as follows:  * **For all
beings:** The entire duration of time. * **For a single being:** The minimum
time span is **Antarmuhurta**. The maximum time span is **31 Sagaropama** with
an additional **Atirek**.  The general time span for **Sasaadana Samyagdristi**
to **Sayogakevali** (liberated by association) and those without **Leshya** is
**1000 Sagaropama**. This is the general time span for each stage from
**Sasaadana Samyagdristi** to **Kshaya**. This is also the general time span for
each stage from **Mithyadrishti** to

## Chapter 1  **107.** In the case of those who consume food, the time period
for the non-liberated soul, in relation to many beings, is all time. In relation
to one being, the shortest time is an antarmūhūrta, and the longest time is an
immeasurable fraction of an angula, the measure of which is immeasurable
immeasurable utsarpini and avasarpini. The general time for the remaining stages
is as stated. In the case of those who do not consume food, the time period for
the non-liberated soul, in relation to many beings, is all time. In relation to
one being, the shortest time is one samaya, and the longest time is three
samayas. In the case of the sā-sādana samyak-drishti and the asamyata samyak-
drishti, the shortest time in relation to many beings is one samaya, and the
longest time is an immeasurable fraction of an avali. In relation to one being,
the shortest time is one samaya, and the longest time is two samayas. In the
case of the sayoga-kevali, the shortest time in relation to many beings is three
samayas, and the longest time is a countable number of samayas. In relation to
one being, the shortest and longest time is three samayas. The general time for
the ayoga-kevali is as stated. Thus, time has been described.  **108.** Now, the
difference is explained. When the desired quality undergoes a transformation
into another quality, and then that quality is attained again, the time in
between is called the difference. This is of two types: general and specific. In
general, there is no difference for the non-liberated soul in relation to many
beings. In relation to one being, the shortest difference is an antarmūhūrta,
and the longest difference is slightly less than two sixty-sixes of a sagara.
The difference for the sā-sādana samyak-drishti, in relation to many beings, is
one samaya. The longest difference is an immeasurable fraction of a palya. In
relation to one being, the shortest difference is an immeasurable fraction of a
palya, and the longest difference is slightly less than half a pudgala-
parivarta.

## 48] **Regarding the difference in time between the attainment of
*Sarvarthasiddhi* (perfect knowledge) for different beings:**  * **For those
with *Samyagmithyadrishti* (right and wrong faith):** The difference in time for
attaining *Sarvarthasiddhi* is similar to that of *Sāsādan* (those who have
attained the first stage of liberation). For one being, the minimum time is an
*antarmuhūrta* (a fraction of a moment). The maximum time is less than half a
*pudgala* (atom) change. * **For those with *Asamyata Samyagdristi*
(uncontrolled right faith) to *Aparamatta Samyata* (perfectly controlled right
faith):** There is no difference in time for attaining *Sarvarthasiddhi* for
different beings. For one being, the minimum time is an *antarmuhūrta*. The
maximum time is less than half a *pudgala* change. * **For the four *Upasamakas*
(those who have attained the second stage of liberation):** The minimum time for
attaining *Sarvarthasiddhi* for different beings is one *samaya* (moment). The
maximum time is a year. For one being, the minimum time is an *antarmuhūrta*.
The maximum time is less than half a *pudgala* change. * **For the four
*Kshapakas* (those who have attained the third stage of liberation) and
*Ayogakevali* (those who have attained the fourth stage of liberation):** The
minimum time for attaining *Sarvarthasiddhi* for different beings is one
*samaya*. The maximum time is six months. For one being, there is no difference
in time. For *Sayogakevali* (those who have attained the fifth stage of
liberation), there is no difference in time for different beings or for one
being.  **8.109. Regarding the difference in time for attaining
*Sarvarthasiddhi* for those in hell:**  * **For those in hell with
*Mithyadrishti* (wrong faith) and *Asamyata Samyagdristi*:** There is no
difference in time for attaining *Sarvarthasiddhi* for different beings. For one
being, the minimum time is an *antarmuhūrta*. The maximum time is less than one
*sāgaropamā* (ocean-sized) for the first hell, less than three *sāgaropamā* for
the second hell, less than seven *sāgaropamā* for the third hell, less than ten
*sāgaropamā* for the fourth hell, less than seventeen *sāgaropamā* for the fifth
hell, less than twenty-two *sāgaropamā* for the sixth hell, and less than
thirty-three *sāgaropamā* for the seventh hell. * **For those with *Sāsādan
Samyagdristi* (those who have attained the first stage of liberation) and
*Samyagmithyadrishti*:** The minimum time for attaining *Sarvarthasiddhi* for
different beings is one *samaya*. The maximum time is an *asankhyeya*
(incalculable) number of *palya* (a very small unit of time). For one being, the
minimum time is an *asankhyeya* number of *palya* and the maximum time is less
than half a *pudgala* change.  **Notes:**  1. *Sāsādan* can only be attained
after falling from the *Gunasthan* (stage of virtue), *Upasama* (second stage of
liberation), and *Samyaktva* (right faith). However, a being can attain
*Upasama* again after a minimum of an *asankhyeya* number of *palya*. Therefore,
the minimum time for *Sāsādan Samyagdristi* is an *asankhyeya* number of
*palya*. 2. A being can attain *Upasama* again after an *antarmuhūrta* after
falling from the *Upasama* stage. Therefore, the minimum time for the four
*Upasamakas* is an *antarmuhūrta*. 3. The maximum time for attaining
*Sarvarthasiddhi* in hell is determined by the duration of *Mithyatva* (wrong
faith) in the hell. The duration of *Mithyatva* is determined by the duration of
*Samyaktva* (right faith) in the hell. The duration of *Samyaktva* is determined
by the duration of *Mithyatva* in the hell. This is why the maximum time for
attaining *Sarvarthasiddhi* in hell is determined by the duration of *Mithyatva*
in the hell.

##  Translation:  **50]**  **Sarvarthasiddhi:**  [1188 111] There is no
difference between the *naana jeevas* (various living beings) in terms of
*prthaktva* (individuality) for *samyata* (restrained), *asamyaata*
(unrestrained), *pramatta* (distracted), and *apramatta* (undistracted).  For a
single *jeeva* (living being), the *jghanya* (inferior) difference is
*antarmuhoorta* (less than a moment), and the *utkarsha* (superior) difference
is *purvakoti prthaktva* (a billion times the previous individuality).  For the
four *upashamaka* (pacifiers), the difference is similar to that of *naana
jeevas*. For a single *jeeva*, the *jghanya* difference is *antarmuhoorta*, and
the *utkarsha* difference is *purvakoti prthaktva*. The difference for the
remaining *gunasthana* (stages of spiritual progress) is similar to that of
*naana jeevas*.  [112] In *devagati* (the state of being a god), there is no
difference between *mithyadrishti* (false belief) and *asamyaatsamyagdristi*
(unrestrained right belief) in comparison to *naana jeevas*. For a single
*jeeva*, the *jghanya* difference is *antarmuhoorta*, and the *utkarsha*
difference is less than thirty-one *sagaropama* (ocean-sized) *desha* (regions).
The difference between *saasadan* (enjoyment) *samyagdristi* (right belief) and
*samyagmithyadrishti* (right-false belief) is similar to that of *naana jeevas*.
For a single *jeeva*, the *jghanya* difference is a fraction of a *palyopama* (a
measure of time) and *antarmuhoorta*, and the *utkarsha* difference is less than
thirty-one *sagaropama* *desha*.  [113] In terms of *indriyanuvaada* (the path
of the senses), there is no difference between *ekendriya* (one-sensed beings)
and *naana jeevas*. For a single *jeeva*, the *jghanya* difference is
*kshudrabhavgrahana* (the perception of a small object), and the *utkarsha*
difference is more than two thousand *sagaropama* *purvakoti prthaktva*. There
is no difference between *vikaleindriya* (disabled-sensed beings) and *naana
jeevas*. For a single *jeeva*, the *jghanya* difference is *kshudrabhavgrahana*,
and the *utkarsha* difference is *ananta kaala* (infinite time) with countless
*pudgalparivarta* (changes in matter). Thus, the difference in terms of
*indriya* is explained.  In terms of *guna* (qualities), there is no difference
in both *naana jeevas* and a single *jeeva*.  The difference between
*mithyadrishti* in *panchendriya* (five-sensed beings) is similar to that of
*naana jeevas*. The difference between *saasadan* *samyagdristi* and
*samyagmithyadrishti* is similar to that of *naana jeevas*. For a single
*jeeva*, the *jghanya* difference is a fraction of a *palyopama* and
*antarmuhoorta*, and the *utkarsha* difference is a thousand *sagaropama*.
[8112] In *devagati*, there is no difference between *mithyadrishti* and
*asamyaatsamyagdristi* in comparison to *naana jeevas*. For a single *jeeva*,
the *jghanya* difference is *antarmuhoorta*, and the *utkarsha* difference is
slightly less than thirty-one *sagaropama*. The difference between *saasadan*
*samyagdristi* and *samyagmithyadrishti* is similar to that of *naana jeevas*.
For a single *jeeva*, the *jghanya* difference is a fraction of a *palyopama*
and *antarmuhoorta*, and the *utkarsha* difference is slightly less than thirty-
one *sagaropama*.  [6113] In terms of *indriyanuvaada*, there is no difference
between *ekendriya* and *naana jeevas*. For a single *jeeva*, the *jghanya*
difference is *kshudrabhavgrahana*, and the *utkarsha* difference is more than
two thousand *sagaropama* *purvakoti prthaktva*. There is no difference between
*vikaleindriya* and *naana jeevas*. For a single *jeeva*, the *jghanya*
difference is *kshudrabhavgrahana*, and the *utkarsha* difference is *ananta
kaala* with countless *pudgalparivarta*. Thus, the difference in terms of
*indriya* is explained.  In terms of *guna*, there is no difference in both
*naana jeevas* and a single *jeeva*.  The difference between *mithyadrishti* in
*panchendriya* is similar to that of *naana jeevas*. The difference between
*saasadan* *samyagdristi* and *samyagmithyadrishti* is similar to that of *naana
jeevas*. For a single *jeeva*, the *jghanya* difference is a fraction of a
*palyopama* and *antarmuhoorta*, and the *utkarsha* difference is a thousand
*sagaropama*.  1. In *bhogabhoomi* (the realm of enjoyment), *samyama*
(restraint) and *asamyama* (unrestraint) or the attainment of *samyama* is not
possible, therefore this difference is only within forty-nine *parvakoti* (a
billion times a billion). 2. In *deva* (gods), *gunasthana* (stages of spiritual
progress) can change up to the ninth *graiveya* (a type of god). This is why the
*utkarsha* difference between *mithyatva* (false belief) and *samyaktva* (right
belief) is slightly less than thirty-one *sagaropama*. 3. The *utkarsha*
difference for staying in *tras* (a type of *paryaya* (cycle of existence)) is
more than two

## Chapter 1  **51.** The difference between the *purvakotiprithaktva* of the
*asamyatasamyagdristi* and the *apramattasamyata* is greater than the difference
between them and other living beings. The difference between them and a single
living being is at least an *antarmuhurt* at the lowest level and at the highest
level, it is greater than a thousand *sagaropama* *purvakotiprithaktva*. The
difference between the four *upasamaka* and other living beings is the same. The
difference between them and a single living being is at least an *antarmuhurt*
at the lowest level and at the highest level, it is greater than a thousand
*sagaropama* *purvakotiprithaktva*. The difference between the rest is the same.
**114.** The difference between the *prithvi*, *jala*, *agni*, and *vayu* bodied
beings and other living beings is the same due to the *kayanuvaada*. The
difference between them and a single living being is at least a
*kshudrabhavgrahan* at the lowest level and at the highest level, it is an
infinite time, which is equal to countless *pudgalparivarta*. The difference
between the *vanaspatikaayika* and other living beings is the same. The
difference between them and a single living being is at least a
*kshudrabhavgrahan* at the lowest level and at the highest level, it is
countless *loka*. Thus, the difference in terms of *kaaya* is explained. In
terms of *guna*, there is no difference between them and other living beings or
a single living being. The difference between the *trasakaayika* and the
*mithyadristi* is the same. The difference between the *sasadan* *samyagdristi*,
*samyam* *mithyadristi*, and other living beings is the same. The difference
between them and a single living being is at least a countless part of a
*palyopama* and an *antarmuhurt* at the lowest level and at the highest level,
it is greater than two thousand *sagaropama* *purvakotiprithaktva*. The
difference between the *asamyatasamyagdristi* and the *apramattasamyata* is
greater than the difference between them and other living beings. The difference
between them and a single living being is at least an *antarmuhurt* at the
lowest level and at the highest level, it is greater than two thousand
*sagaropama* *purvakotiprithaktva*. The difference between the four *upasamaka*
and other living beings is the same. The difference between them and a single
living being is at least an *antarmuhurt* at the lowest level and at the highest
level, it is greater than a thousand *sagaropama* *purvakotiprithaktva*. The
difference between the rest is the same.  **8114.** Due to the *kayanuvaada*,
the difference between the *prithvi*, *jala*, *agni*, and *vayu* bodied beings
and other living beings is the same. The difference between them and a single
living being is at least a *kshudrabhavgrahan* at the lowest level and at the
highest level, it is an infinite time, which is equal to countless
*pudgalparivarta*. The difference between the *vanaspatikaayika* and other
living beings is the same. The difference between them and a single living being
is at least a *kshudrabhavgrahan* at the lowest level and at the highest level,
it is countless *loka*. Thus, the difference in terms of *kaaya* is explained.
When considering the *gunasthan*, there is no difference between them and other
living beings or a single living being. This means there is no difference
between them in terms of both the highest and lowest levels. The difference
between the *trasakaayika* and the *mithyadristi* is the same. The difference
between the *sasadan* *samyagdristi*, *samyam* *mithyadristi*, and other living
beings is the same. The difference between them and a single living being is at
least a countless part of a *palyopama* and an *antarmuhurt* at the lowest level
and at the highest level, it is greater than two thousand *sagaropama*
*purvakotiprithaktva*. The difference between the *asamyatasamyagdristi* and the
*apramattasamyata* is greater than the difference between them and other living
beings. The difference between them and a single living being is at least an
*antarmuhurt* at the lowest level and at the highest level, it is greater than
two thousand *sagaropama* *purvakotiprithaktva*.   **Note:** The text mentions
adjustments to the highest level difference for various *gunasthan*. These
adjustments are:  * **Sasaadana:** Subtract a countless part of an *avali* and
nine *antarmuhurt* from a thousand *sagaropama* *purvakotiprithaktva*. *
**Misra:** Subtract twelve *antarmuhurt*. * **Asamyata Samyagdristi:** Subtract
ten *antarmuhurt*. * **Samyata Samyata:** Subtract three *paksha*, three *dina*,
and twelve *antarmuhurt*. * **Pramatta Samyata and Aprammatta Samyata:**
Subtract eight years and ten *antarmuhurt*. * **Apuurvakarana, etc. (four
upasamaka):** Add 30, 28, 26, and 24 *antarmuhurt* respectively and subtract
eight years.

being, the least is an antarmūhūrta. For the highest, it is more than two
thousand sagaropamas multiplied by a hundred koti. For the rest, it is like the
five senses. 8115. According to the Yoga Anuvāda, there is no difference between
the Kayayogi, Vachanayogi, and Manoyogi, Mithyadṛṣṭi, Asamyatasamyagdṛṣṭi,
Samyatasamyata, Pramattasamyata, Apramattasamyata, and Sayogakevali, compared to
many beings and one being. For Sasadan Samyagdṛṣṭi and Samyagmithyadṛṣṭi, it is
the same compared to many beings. For one being, there is no difference. For the
four Upashamakas, it is the same compared to many beings. For one being, there
is no difference. For the four Kshapakas and the Ayogakevali, it is the same.
8116. According to the Veda Anuvāda, for the Strivedis, there is no difference
for Mithyadṛṣṭi compared to many beings. For one being, the least is an
antarmūhūrta. For the highest, it is less than fifty-five palyopamas. For
Sasadan Samyagdṛṣṭi and Samyagmithyadṛṣṭi, it is the same compared to many
beings. For one being, the least is an uncountable part of a palyopama and an
antarmūhūrta. For the highest, it is a hundred palyopamas. For
Asamyatasamyagdṛṣṭi to Apramattasamyata, there is no difference compared to many
beings. For one being, the least is an antarmūhūrta. For the highest, it is a
hundred palyopamas. For the two Upashamakas, it is the same compared to many
beings. For one being, the least is an antarmūhūrta. For the highest, it is a
hundred palyopamas. For the two Kshapakas, the least is one time compared to
many beings. For the highest, it is a year. For one being, the highest
difference is more than two thousand sagaropamas multiplied by a hundred koti.
The difference between the four Upashamakas is the same as that of many beings.
For one being, the least difference is an antarmūhūrta and the highest
difference is more than two thousand sagaropamas multiplied by a hundred koti.
The difference between the remaining Gunasthānas is the same as that of the five

Kayayogi, Vachanayogi, and Manoyogi, Mithyadṛṣṭi, Asamyatasamyagdṛṣṭi,
Samyatasamyata, Pramattasamyata, Apramattasamyata, and Sayogakevali, compared to
many beings and one being. For Sasadan Samyagdṛṣṭi and Samyagmithyadṛṣṭi, it is

hundred palyopamas. For the two Kshapakas, the least is one time compared to
many beings. For the highest, it is a year. 1. Five antarmūhūrtas less than
fifty-five palyas. 2. The highest time for Strivedis is a hundred palyopamas.
Subtracting two times from it, we get the difference for Sasadan Samyagdṛṣṭi in
Strivedis. Subtracting six antarmūhūrtas from it, we get the highest difference
for Samyagmithyadṛṣṭi. Further, we should calculate the Agamānāsāra in the same
way. ]

## Chapter 1  **117.** In the case of men, the difference between Mithyadrishti
and the others is like an ocean. The difference between Saasadan Samyagdristi
and Samyagmithyadrishti, in relation to different beings, is like an ocean. In
relation to a single being, the difference between the lowest and the highest is
like an immeasurable part of a Palya and an Antarmuhurt respectively. The
difference between the highest and the lowest is like a hundred oceans. In the
case of Asanyata Samyagdristi and the others, there is no difference in relation

difference is the same as for multiple beings.  **Explanation:**  The time
difference between a single being and multiple beings is significant. This is
because the restrained and unrestrained have a different experience of time than
those who are not restrained. The time difference is also affected by the type
of knowledge that a being has. For example, the mithyadristi has a different
experience of time than the samyagdristi.  **Note:** The terms "antarmuhurta"
and "palya" are units of time in Jainism.

##  **Sarvarthasiddhi** [118 § 131 8.131. The difference in *mithyadrishti* for
those who consume food is similar to the difference in the *ogha* (flow of
karma). The difference in *sāsādanasamyakdrishti* and *samyakmithyadrishti* in
relation to many beings is similar to the difference in the *ogha*. In relation
to one being, the least difference is a fraction of a *palyopamā* (a measure of
time) and an *antarmuhūrta* (a moment), while the greatest difference is a
fraction of an *angula* (finger) which is *asanख्येया* (innumerable) in number,
the measure of which is *asanख्येया* *asanख्येया* *utsarpini* and *avasarpini*
(ascending and descending cycles of time). From *asanayatasamyakdrishti* to
*aprammatta* *samyata* (the stages of spiritual progress), there is no
difference in relation to many beings. In relation to one being, the least
difference is an *antarmuhūrta* and the greatest difference is a fraction of an
*angula* which is *asanख्येया* in number, the measure of which is *asanख्येया*
*asanख्येया* *utsarpini* and *avasarpini*. The difference in the four
*upasamaka* (stages of spiritual progress) in relation to many beings is similar
to the difference in the *ogha*. In relation to one being, the least difference
is an *antarmuhūrta* and the greatest difference is a fraction of an *angula*
which is *asanख्येया* in number, the measure of which is *asanख्येया*
*asanख्येया* *utsarpini* and *avasarpini*. The difference in the four *kshapika*
(stages of spiritual progress) and the *sayogakevali* (liberated beings) is
similar to the difference in the *ogha*. 60] $ 132. In those who do not consume
food, there is no difference in *mithyadrishti* in relation to many beings and
one being. The difference in *sāsādanasamyakdrishti* in relation to many beings
is a minimum of one *samaya* (a measure of time) and a maximum of a fraction of
a *palyopamā*. There is no difference in relation to one being. The difference
in *asanayatasamyakdrishti* in relation to many beings is a minimum of one
*samaya* and a maximum of a *māsapṛthaktva* (a month). There is no difference in
relation to one being. The difference in *sayogakevali* in relation to many
beings is a minimum of one *samaya* and a maximum of a *varshaprthaktva* (a
year). There is no difference in relation to one being. The difference in
*ayogakevali* in relation to many beings is a minimum of one *bhrama* (a
rotation of the earth) and a maximum of six months. There is no difference in
relation to one being. This is how the difference is considered. 9 133. Now we
consider *bhāva* (state of being). It is of two types: general and specific. .

## Chapter 1:  **Mithyadrishti** is an **audayika** state.
**Sāsādanasamyakdrishti** is a **pāriṇāmika** state. **Samyagmithyadrishti** is
a **kṣayopashamika** state. **Asamyatasamyagdrishti** is an **aupashamika**,
**kṣayika**, or **kṣayopashamika** state. However, **asamyata** in this case is
due to an **audayika** state. **Samyatāsamyata**, **pramattasamyata**, and
**apramattasamyata** are **kṣayopashamika** states. The four **upashamikas** are
**aupashamika** states. The four **kṣapakas**, **sayogakevali**, and
**ayogakevali** are **kṣayika** states.  ## 134:  Specifically, in terms of
**gati** (motion), in the **narakagati** (hell realm), on the first **prithvi**
(earth), the **narakas** (hell beings) from **mithyadrishti** to
**asamyatasamyagdrishti** have the same **ogha** (flow) as the general
population. From the second to the seventh **prithvi**, **mithyadrishti**,
**sāsādanasamyakdrishti**, and **samyagmithyadrishti** have the same **ogha** as
the general population. **Asamyatasamyagdrishti** is an **aupashamika** or
**kṣayopashamika** state. However, **asamyata** in this case is due to an
**audayika** state. In the **tiryanchgati** (animal realm), the **tiryanch**
(animals) from **mithyadrishti** to **samyatāsamyata** have the same **ogha** as
the general population. In the **manushygati** (human realm), the **manushyas**
(humans) from **mithyadrishti** to **ayogakevali** have the same **ogha** as the
general population. In the **devagati** (heavenly realm), the **devas** (gods)
from **mithyadrishti** to **asamyatasamyagdrishti** have the same **ogha** as
the general population.  ## 135:  In terms of **indriya** (sense organs),
**ekendriya** (one-sense) and **vikaleindriya** (disabled sense) beings are
**audayika** states. In **panchendriya** (five-sense) beings, from
**mithyadrishti** to **ayogakevali**, each **gunasthan** (stage of spiritual
development) has the same **ogha** as the general population.  ## 136:  In terms
of **kaya** (body), **sthāvarakāyika** (stationary body) beings are **audayika**
states. **Trasakāyika** (mobile body) beings have the same **ogha** as the
general population.  ## 137:  In terms of **yoga** (union), **kāyayogi** (body-
focused), **vachanayogi** (speech-focused), and **manoyogi** (mind-focused)
beings, from **mithyadrishti** to **sayogakevali**, have the same **ogha** as
the general population.   **Note:** The text also includes a brief explanation
of the **pāriṇāmika** and **kṣayopashamika** states of **sāsādanasamyakdrishti**
and **samyagmithyadrishti**, respectively.

##  621 **Sarvartha Siddhi**  [1188136] **General:**  8138. **Vedānuvāde**
(Translation of Veda):  The same for all beings who are Vedī (possess Veda),
including those who are Strī Vedī (female Vedī), Puruṣa Vedī (male Vedī),
Napumsaka Vedī (neuter Vedī), and those who are devoid of Veda.  8139.
**Kapāyānuvāde** (Translation of Kṣayā): The same for all beings who have Kṣayā
(passions), including those who have Krodha Kṣayā (anger), Māna Kṣayā (pride),
Māyā Kṣayā (deceit), and Lobha Kṣayā (greed), and those who are devoid of Kṣayā.
8140. **Jñānānuvāde** (Translation of Knowledge): The same for all beings who
have Jñāna (knowledge), including those who have Mati Jñāna (knowledge of the
mind), Śruta Jñāna (knowledge from scriptures), Avadi Jñāna (knowledge of
perception), Manaḥparyaya Jñāna (knowledge of the mind's activities), and Kevala
Jñāna (perfect knowledge).  8141. **Samyanānuvāde** (Translation of Restraint):
The same for all beings who are Samyata (restrained), including those who are
Samyata-Samyata (restrained and restrained), and those who are Asamyata
(unrestrained).  8142. **Darśanānuvāde** (Translation of Vision): The same for
all beings who have Darśana (vision), including those who have Cakṣu Darśana
(eye vision), Acākṣu Darśana (non-eye vision), Avadi Darśana (perception
vision), and Kevala Darśana (perfect vision).  8143. **Leśyānuvāde**
(Translation of Leśyā): The same for all beings who have Leśyā (subtle karmic
tendencies), including those who have Ṣaḍ Leśyā (six Leśyā), and those who are
devoid of Leśyā.  8144. **Bhavyaanuvaade** (Translation of Bhavya): The same for
all beings who are Bhavya (destined for liberation), from Mithyādrṣṭi (wrong
belief) to Ayogakevali (liberated without effort). For Abhavya (not destined for
liberation), there are only Pariṇāmik (consequential) states.  8145.
**Samyaktvanuvaade** (Translation of Right Faith): For beings with Kṣayika
Samyagdṛṣṭi (right faith with karmic tendencies), the state of Asamyata
Samyagdṛṣṭi (unrestrained right faith) is Kṣayika (with karmic tendencies). This
is Kṣayika Samyaktva. However, Asamyatva (unrestrained state) is Audayika (with
karmic potential). For beings who are Samyata-Samyata (restrained and
restrained), Pramatta-Samyata (restrained with negligence), and Apramatta-
Samyata (restrained without negligence), the state is Kṣayopasamik (with karmic
tendencies diminishing). This is Kṣayika Samyaktva. For the four Upasamaka
(subduers of passions), the state is Aupaśamik (with karmic tendencies
diminishing). This is Kṣayika Samyaktva. For the remaining Gunasthāna (stages of
spiritual progress), the state is the same as the general state. For beings with
Kṣayopasamik Samyagdṛṣṭi (right faith with diminishing karmic tendencies), the
state of Asamyata Samyagdṛṣṭi (unrestrained right faith) is Kṣayopasamik (with
diminishing karmic tendencies). The state of Kṣayopasamik Dṛṣṭi (right faith
with diminishing karmic tendencies) is the same as the state of beings from
Sayogakevali (liberated with effort) to Ayogakevali (liberated without effort).
38. **Vedānuvāde** (Translation of Veda): The same for all beings who are Vedī
(possess Veda), including those who are Strī Vedī (female Vedī), Puruṣa Vedī

## Chapter One  **1188148**  Samyaktvam (Right Faith) is characterized by the
cessation of kshaya (karmic defilement).  However, for the asamyata (non-
controlled), it is an audayika (arising) state. For the samyata-samyata
(controlled-controlled), pramatta-samyata (careless-controlled), and aprammatta-
samyata (careful-controlled), it is a kshayopaśamika (cessation of kshaya)
state. This kshayopaśamika state is Samyaktvam.  Among the aupaśamika (subdued)
samyagdrsti (right vision), the asamyata samyagdrsti is an aupaśamika state.
This aupaśamika state is Samyaktvam.  However, for the asamyata, it is an
audayika state. For the samyata-samyata, pramatta-samyata, and aprammatta-
samyata, it is a kshayopaśamika state. This aupaśamika state is Samyaktvam.  The
aupaśamika state of the four upasamaka (subduers) is Samyaktvam.  The parināmika
(consequential) state of the sasadan samyagdrsti (right vision with attachment)
is Samyaktvam.  The kshayopaśamika state of the samyag-mithyadrsti (right-wrong
vision) is Samyaktvam.  The audayika state of the mithyadrsti (wrong vision) is
Samyaktvam.  **8146.**  The state of the sanjna (conscious) is similar to the
flow of the sanjna. The state of the asanjna (unconscious) is audayika. The
state of those who are devoid of both sanjna and asanjna is similar to the flow
of both.  **8147.**  The state of the aharaka (eating) and anaharaka (non-
eating) is similar to the flow of the aharaka. Thus, the state is complete.
**8148.**  Now, we discuss the alpa-bahutvam (few-many). It is of two types:
samanya (general) and visesha (specific).  Generally, the three upasamaka are
the fewest, equal in number to the number of entrances into their respective
gunasthanas (states of merit) and kalas (times).  The upashanta-kshaya (those
with subdued karmic defilement) are equal in number.  The kshapaka (destroyers)
of the three gunasthanas, starting with apurvakarana (initial karma), are
numerous.  The kshina-kshaya-vitraga (those with destroyed karmic defilement,
free from attachment) are equal in number.  The sayoga-kevali (liberated with
attachments) and ayoga-kevali (liberated without attachments) are equal in
number to the number of entrances.  The sayoga-kevali, who are numerous, are
gathered in their own time.  The aprammatta-samyata (careful-controlled) are
numerous.  The pramatta-samyata (careless-controlled) are numerous.  The
samyata-samyata (controlled-controlled) are innumerable.  The sasadan-
samyagdrsti (right vision with attachment) are innumerable.  The samyag-
mithyadrsti (right-wrong vision) are numerous.  The asamyata-samyagdrsti (non-
controlled right vision) are innumerable.  The mithyadrsti (wrong vision) are
infinite.

[64] In terms of the path of motion (gatyānuvāda), in hell, in all the earths,
in all the hells, the number of Sāsādanasamyakdṛṣṭis is the least. From them,
the number of Samyakmithyādṛṣṭis is countable. From them, the number of
Asamyatasamyagdṛṣṭis is uncountable. From them, the number of Mithyādṛṣṭis is
uncountable. In the path of the animals (tiryanch), in all the animals, the
number of Samyatāsamyatas is the least. The rest of the animals, with their
different qualities, are like the ocean. In the path of humans (manushya), the
number of humans from the Upasamakas to the Pramattasamyaṭas is like the ocean.
From the Pramattasamyaṭas, the number of Samyatāsamyatas is countable. From
them, the number of Sāsādanasamyakdṛṣṭis is countable. From them, the number of
Samyakmithyādṛṣṭis is countable. From them, the number of Asamyatasamyagdṛṣṭis
is countable. From them, the number of Mithyādṛṣṭis is uncountable. In the path
of the gods (deva), the number of gods is like the number of hell beings. [150]
In terms of the path of the senses (indriyānuvāda), there is no difference in
the number of qualities (guṇasthāna) between those with one sense and those with
a deficient sense, hence there is no difference in their number. The number of
those with five senses is like the ocean. But there is this difference: the
number of Mithyādṛṣṭis is uncountable. [151] In terms of the path of the body
(kāyānuvāda), there is no difference in the number of qualities (guṇasthāna)
between the stationary-bodied beings, hence there is no difference in their
number. The number of those with three bodies is like the number of those with
five senses. [152] In terms of the path of yoga (yogānuvāda), the number of
those with speech-yoga and mind-yoga is like the number of those with five
senses. The number of those with body-yoga is like the ocean. In terms of the
path of knowledge (vedānuvāda), the number of those with female knowledge and
male knowledge is like the number of those with five senses. The number of those
with neuter knowledge and those without knowledge is like the ocean. [153] In
terms of the path of passions (kaṣāyānuvāda), the number of those with anger-
passion, pride-passion, and deceit-passion is like the number of those with male
knowledge. But there is this difference: the number of Mithyādṛṣṭis is infinite.
The number of those with greed-passion is equal to the number of the two
Upasamakas. From them, the number of Kṣapakas is countable. From them, the
number of those with subtle-subtle-purification-Upasamaka-Samyata is much
greater. From them, 1. The sense (indriya) is meant. From the five senses, there
are many more senses, up to the end of the senses. (Pancha-mu.) 2. The action
(kārya) is meant. The number of those with a body of light (tejas-kāya) is the
least. From them, the number of those with an earth-body (pṛthivī-kāya) is
greater. From them, the number of those with an ap-kāya is less. From them, the
number of those with a vāta-kāya is greater. From them, the number of plants
(vanaspati) is infinite. (Sa mu.)

The English translation preserving the Jain terms is as follows:  The first
chapter discusses the special qualities of the Samyata (restrained) and Asanyata
(unrestrained) beings. The subtle Samparaya (future life) Kshapakas (destroyers
of karmas) have enumerable qualities. The rest are like the general case.  154.
By the translation of Jnana (knowledge), in the Matijnani (possessors of sensory
knowledge) and Shrutajnanis (possessors of scriptural knowledge), the Sasadana
Samyagdrishti (partially right faith) are the least in number. The Mithyadrishti
(wrong faith) are infinite in number. In the Vibhangajnanis (possessors of
analytical knowledge), the Sasadana Samyagdrishti are the least in number. The
Mithyadrishti are innumerable in number. In the Matijnani, Shrutajnani and
Avadhijnani, the four Upashamaka (subsiders of karmas) and the four Kshapakas
are enumerable in number. The Apramattasanyata (non-negligent restrained) are
enumerable in number. The Pramattasanyata (negligent restrained) are enumerable
in number. The Sanyatasanyata (restrained and unrestrained) are innumerable in
number. The Asanyatasamyagdrishti (unrestrained with right faith) are
innumerable in number. In the Manaḥparyayjnanis (possessors of telepathic
knowledge), the four Upashamaka and the four Kshapakas are the least in number.
The Apramattasanyata are enumerable in number. The Pramattasanyata are
enumerable in number. For the Kevaljnanis (omniscient), the Ayogakevalins (non-
yogic omniscient) have the same number as the Sayogakevalins (yogic omniscient).
8155. By the translation of Samyama (restraint), in the Samayika (equanimity)
and Chedopasthapana Shuddhi Sanyatas (restrained with purity of renunciation),
the number of the two Upashamaka is equal. From them, the Kshapakas are
enumerable in number. The Apramatta (non-negligent) are enumerable in number.
The Pramatta (negligent) are enumerable in number. In the Pariharavisuddhi
Sanyatas (restrained with purity of expiation), the Pramatta are enumerable in
number compared to the Apramatta. In the Sukshmasamparaya Shuddhi Sanyatas
(restrained with subtle purity of future life), the Kshapakas are enumerable in
number compared to the Upashamaka. In the Yathakyataviharavisuddhi Sanyatas
(restrained with purity of actual conduct), the Kshīṇakashayas (those with
destroyed passions) are enumerable in number compared to the Upashantakashayas
(those with subsided passions). The Ayogakevalins are only that much. The
Sayogakevalins are enumerable in number. There is no less or more between the
Sanyatasanyata. In the Asanyatas, the Sasadana Samyagdrishti are the least in
number. From them, the Samyagmithyadrishti are enumerable in number. From them,
the Asanyatasamyagdrishti are innumerable in number. The Mithyadrishti are
infinite in number.  8156. By the translation of Darshana (perception), the
Cakshudarshinis (possessors of visual perception) are like the Manoyogis (those
engaged in mental activities). The Acakshudarshinis (possessors of non-visual
perception) are like the Kayayogis (those engaged in physical activities). The
Avadhidarshinis (possessors of clairvoyant perception) are like the Avadhijnanis
(possessors of clairvoyant knowledge). The Kevaldarshinis (possessors of
omniscient perception) are like the Kevaljnanis (omniscient beings). The
Sukshmasamparaya Kshapakas are enumerable in number. The less or more of the
rest of the Gunasthanavalas (beings in different stages of spiritual
development) is like the general case.

-119 § 164] Chapter One [67 8161. According to the translation of the term
"āhāras," the number of "āhārakas" is like that of the "kāyayogis." Among the
"anāhārakas," the "sayogakevalis" are the fewest. The "ayogakevalis" are
countless times more than them. The "sāsādanasamyakdṛṣṭis" are countless times
more than them. The "asamyatasamyagdṛṣṭis" are countless times more than them.
The "mithyādṛṣṭis" are infinitely more than them. I 8162. Thus, the general
consideration of "mithyādṛṣṭi" etc. in terms of "gati" etc. has been done. In
this, the subtle differences should be understood according to the "āgama."
8163. Thus, the characteristics, origin, master, object, placement, and means of
attainment of "samyakdarśana," which was first mentioned, have been described.
In relation to this, the names and quantities of "jīva" etc. have also been
described. After this, "samyakjñāna" is worthy of consideration, therefore the
next sūtra says: "matijñāna, śrutajñāna, avadhijñāna, manas-paryayajñāna, and
kevalajñāna are the five types of knowledge." ||9|| 8164. The word "jñāna" in
the sūtra should be combined with each word like "mati" etc. For example,
"matijñāna," "śrutajñāna," "avadhijñāna," "manas-paryayajñāna," and
"kevalajñāna." The meaning of "mati" derived from its etymology is: "Indriyas
and manas perceive objects according to their nature, by which they contemplate,
or simply contemplation is called 'mati'." The meaning of "śruta" derived from
its etymology is: "When the covering karma of "āvaraṇa" is destroyed and
subsided, the object that is being investigated is heard by this, or simply
hearing is called 'śruta'." The mention of "mati" and "śruta" together is
because there is a cause-and-effect relationship between them. As it will be
said later, "śruta is preceded by mati." The meaning of "avadhi" derived from
its etymology is: "Knowledge of objects that are not hidden due to lack of
speech or due to being covered." "Manas" is said to be the mind that is not
related to others. Due to its association, its "paryaya"

## Translation:  [68] **Sarvarthasiddhi 194** [119 § 164]   **Manas-paryaya** is
the knowledge of the mind's movement. If it is argued that this is **mati-
jnana** (knowledge of perception), then it is not so, because it is only a
matter of expectation. This knowledge is only characterized by the increased
power of **kshayopa-shama** (destruction of karmas and their effects) and is
only applied to one's own and others' minds. For example, "Look at the moon in
the sky." Here, the reference is only to the sky. **Kevala** (omniscience) is
the knowledge that is sought by those who practice **tapas** (austerities) both
externally and internally. Alternatively, the word **kevala** signifies
"helpless," so **kevala-jnana** is also called "helpless knowledge." **Kevala-
jnana** is attained at the end, hence it is mentioned at the end of the sutra.
Because it is near, **manas-paryaya** is grasped near it.   **Question:** Why is
**manas-paryaya** near **kevala-jnana**?  **Answer:** Because both have
**samyama** (concentration) as their basis, therefore **manas-paryaya** is near
**kevala-jnana**.   **Avadhi-jnana** (clairvoyance) is far from **manas-
paryaya**, hence it is mentioned before **manas-paryaya**.   **Question:** Why
is **avadhi-jnana** said to be far from **manas-paryaya**?  **Answer:** Because
**avadhi-jnana** is very far from **manas-paryaya**.   **Pratyaksha** (direct
perception) is mentioned before **paroksha** (indirect perception) because it is
easier. **Mati** (perception) is based on **shruta** (scriptural knowledge),
which is known, familiar, and experienced, and is therefore easily attainable by
almost all beings.   Thus, there are five types of knowledge. Their distinctions
will be discussed later.  **Special Note:** This sutra describes the five types
of **samyak-jnana** (right knowledge) in order. Although the sutra mentions
"jnana" (knowledge), it should be understood that these five are types of
**samyak-jnana** because the topic is **samyak-tva** (rightness). Although the
soul is inherently **kevala-jnana**, there is no difference in the original
knowledge, but due to the difference in **avaranas** (veils), it is divided into
five parts.   In explaining this sutra, **Sarvarthasiddhi** highlights three
main points:  1. The etymological meaning of words like **mati** etc. 2. The
reason for mentioning **mati** and **shruta** together. 3. The reason for
mentioning the five types of knowledge in the order of **mati**, **shruta**,
etc.  [8165] It has been said that knowledge is attained through **pramana**
(proof) and **naya** (logic). **Pramana** is considered to be knowledge by some.

## Chapter 1  [11108169] **Chapter 1**  [69] **Question:** What are the objects
of the senses? **Answer:** To establish that only the objects of the senses are
the means of knowledge, the following sutra is stated:  **Sutra:** That
(knowledge) is the means of knowledge. [1100 8166]  **Question:** What is the
purpose of this sutra? **Answer:** To refute the assumption of other means of
knowledge. Some people assume that **sannnikarsha** (contact) is the means of
knowledge, and others assume that the senses are the means of knowledge. To
refute these assumptions, the sutra states "that" (knowledge) is the means of
knowledge. This means that knowledge itself is the means of knowledge, and not
anything else.  [8167] **Question:** What is the flaw in considering
**sannnikarsha** or the senses as the means of knowledge? **Answer:** If
**sannnikarsha** is considered the means of knowledge, then there would be a
possibility of not perceiving subtle, distant, or obstructed objects, because
they do not come into contact with the senses. This would lead to the absence of
omniscience. Similarly, if the senses are considered the means of knowledge, the
same flaw arises because the objects of the senses are limited, while the
objects of knowledge are unlimited.  [8168] **Question:** There is also the
absence of contact between all the senses. The eye and the mind are not capable
of being the object of each other. This lack of mutual objectification will be
discussed later.  [8169] **Question:** If knowledge is considered the means of
knowledge, then there would be a lack of fruit. In reality, knowledge itself is
considered the desired fruit, not any other object. If knowledge is considered
the means of knowledge, then it cannot have any other fruit. However, the means
of knowledge should have a fruit. If **sannnikarsha** or the senses are
considered the means of knowledge, then knowledge becomes a different fruit,
which is not appropriate.  **Sutra:** The five types of knowledge are the two
forms of the means of knowledge. [10]  [8166] **Question:** Why is the word
"that" used in the sutra? **Answer:** The word "that" is used in the sutra to
refute the assumption of those who consider **sannnikarsha** and other things as
the means of knowledge. Many people believe that **sannnikarsha** is the means
of knowledge, and others believe that the senses are the means of knowledge. To
refute these assumptions, the word "that" is used in the sutra, which clarifies
that knowledge itself is the means of knowledge, and not anything else.  [8167]

## 70] Sarvarthasiddhi  [11108169 Dhigama is the fruit, and because it is dual,
the fruit, Dhigama, must also be dual. Therefore, the Dhigama of Aryas etc. is
also obtained. If it is said that because the self is conscious, there is
Samavaya in it, then it is not so; because in the absence of Jnasvabhava, all
are unconscious. If Jnasvabhava is accepted, then there would be a contradiction
of one's own opinion.  170. It is said that there is no fruit in knowledge being
the proof. This is not a fault; because pleasure is seen in the understanding of
the object. When the self, though having Jnasvabhava, is still stained by karma,
pleasure arises upon the certainty of the object by the dependence on the sense
organs. This is called the fruit. Indifference or the destruction of ignorance
is the fruit. Indifference is the non-attachment to raga and dvesha. The
destruction of ignorance, which is like darkness, is also called the fruit.
171. Praman means that which makes one know, or that by which one knows, or
simply the measure of knowing. What is known by this? The object, such as the
soul, etc. If proof is the cause of the knowledge of the soul, etc., then
another proof must be assumed for the knowledge of the proof. If this is so,
then there is an infinite regress. There is no infinite regress, just like a
lamp. Just as a lamp is the cause of the illumination of pots, etc., and is also
the cause of the illumination of its own form, so also there is no need to seek
another illumination. Similarly, proof is also like this. It is necessary to
accept this. If another proof is assumed for the proof, like the object, then
there is no knowledge of oneself, and hence there is no memory. In the absence
of memory, there would be no practice.  **Explanation:** It is not right to say
that if proximity is considered as proof and the knowledge of the object as the
fruit, then because proximity is dual, the knowledge resulting from it should
also be dual. Therefore, the knowledge of pots, etc. is also obtained.
**Doubt:** The self is conscious, therefore, there is Samavaya of knowledge in
it?  **Explanation:** No, because if the self is not considered to have
Jnasvabhava, then all objects are found to be unconscious. If the self is
considered to have Jnasvabhava, then there would be a contradiction of one's own
opinion.  **170..** The first party, who said that there is no fruit in
considering knowledge as proof, is not at fault; because pleasure is seen when
there is knowledge of the object. Although the self has Jnasvabhava, it is still
stained by karma. Therefore, when the certainty of the object arises from the
dependence on the sense organs, the pleasure that arises from it is called the
fruit of the proof. Or, indifference or the destruction of ignorance is the
fruit of the proof. The non-occurrence of raga and dvesha-like transformations
is indifference, and the removal of ignorance, which is like darkness, is the
destruction of ignorance. These are also the fruits of the proof.  **171.** The
meaning of the word Praman, as derived from its etymology, is - Praminoti,
Pramiyate'nena Pramitimatram va Pramanam - that which makes one know well, that
by which one knows well, or simply the measure of knowing.  **Doubt:** What is
known by the proof?  **Explanation:** The object, such as the soul, etc. is
known.  **Doubt:** If proof is the cause of the knowledge of the soul, etc.,
then another proof must be assumed for the knowledge of the proof. And if this
is assumed, then the fault of infinite regress arises?  **Explanation:** There
is no fault of infinite regress in considering proof as the cause of the
knowledge of the soul, etc., just like a lamp. Just as a lamp is the cause of
the illumination of pots, etc., and is also the cause of the illumination of its
own form, so also there is no need to seek another illumination. Similarly,
proof is also like this. This must be accepted. Now, if another proof is assumed
for the proof, like the object, then there is no knowledge of oneself, and hence
there is no memory. In the absence of memory, there would be no practice.  1.

## Chapter One  [71 8172. The dual-number reference is in relation to the
distinctions that will be explained later. For it will be said, "The first is
indirect, the other is direct." This dual-number reference is meant to negate
the existence of other types of knowledge. 8 72. The dual-number reference in
the sutra is in relation to the distinctions that will be explained later. It
will be said, "The first is indirect, the other is direct." This dual-number
reference is meant to negate the existence of other types of knowledge.
**Special Note:** In the previous sutra, five types of right knowledge were
discussed, and in this sutra, their validity is explained. While it is clear
that right knowledge is valid, other schools of thought do not consider
knowledge as the primary source of knowledge, but rather consider proximity or
sense organs as the source of knowledge. Therefore, here it is explained that
proximity, etc., are not the source of knowledge, but knowledge itself is the
source of knowledge. In the Sarvarthasiddhi commentary, two main views are
mentioned and criticized. Both these views are accepted by the Nyaya school. The
Nyaya school considers both proximity and sense organs as the source of
knowledge in the origin of direct knowledge. The view that proximity is the
source of knowledge is mentioned in the Nyaya Bhashya, and the view that sense
organs are the source of knowledge is mentioned in Uddyotakara's Nyaya Varttika.
However, when the Sarvarthasiddhikar mentions this second view, it seems to be
as ancient as the first view. It is very likely that the Sarvarthasiddhikar
mentioned the Sankhya view that "sense organ activity is the source of
knowledge," and there is no surprise in that. The Nyaya school considers
proximity as an extraordinary cause in the origin of direct knowledge and
considers it as the source of knowledge. However, later on, the term "cause" is
used for the "extraordinary cause." This definition has been replaced by the
definition of "cause" as "the cause that is involved in activity," which has led
to the acceptance of sense organs as the source of knowledge in their school.
When they consider proximity as the source of knowledge, knowledge is considered
its result, and when they consider sense organs as the source of knowledge,
proximity is considered the activity of the sense organs, and knowledge is
considered its result. This does not mean that they do not consider knowledge as
the source of knowledge. They also consider knowledge as the source of knowledge
in their school. When they consider knowledge as the source of knowledge, then
right understanding, wrong understanding, and indifference are considered its
results. However, the Nyaya school's view of considering proximity and sense
organs as the source of knowledge is not appropriate. This is the conclusion
reached in the commentary on this sutra. The following are the flaws in
considering proximity as the source of knowledge: 1. Knowledge of subtle,
obstructed, and distant objects is not possible, therefore, omniscience is
absent. 2. Knowledge cannot be generated by the eye and mind because they are
incapable of acquiring knowledge. 3. It is not appropriate to consider each
sense organ as having a separate object, because the eye's contact with form
makes it the generator of knowledge of form, and similarly, it also has contact
with taste, therefore, it should also generate knowledge of taste. 4. Proximity
is not a single entity, but rather a combination of two or more entities, namely
the sense organ and the object, therefore, the result of proximity, which is
knowledge, should also be present in both. The following are the flaws in
considering sense organs as the source of knowledge: 1. Omniscience is absent
because sense organs are incapable of knowing all objects simultaneously. 2.
Omniscience is also absent because knowledge of subtle, obstructed, and distant
objects is not possible through sense organs. 3. Knowledge such as inference,
etc., cannot be generated because these types of knowledge are not generated by
sense organs. There are other flaws in considering proximity and sense organs as
the source of knowledge. Those who consider proximity and sense organs as the
source of knowledge raise a major objection to considering knowledge as the
source of knowledge, saying that if knowledge is considered the source of
knowledge, then the source of knowledge becomes ineffective. However, this
objection is also not appropriate because...  |

72]] Sarvarthasiddhau [11108173 - $ 173. 'The knowledge of the five factors
mentioned above is included in the two proofs. To refute the idea that the two
proofs are प्रत्यक्ष (direct perception) and अनुमान (inference) etc., the
following sutra is stated: The first two are indirect proofs. ||1|| 8174. The
word 'आदि' (ādi) indicates priority. What is first is called 'आद्य' (ādy). How
can there be two firsts? The answer is that the first is the main and the second
is the secondary.  The knowledge of मति (mati) is the first according to the
main concept, and the knowledge of श्रुत (śruta) is also considered first
because it is close to it. The word 'आद्य' (ādy) is used in the dual form, so it
also includes the secondary. The compound word 'आद्यच आद्य च आद्य' (ādyaca
ādyaca ādy) means both the knowledge of मति (mati) and the knowledge of श्रुत
(śruta). Both of these are indirect proofs. Question: Why are these two indirect
proofs? Answer: Because they are dependent on something else. It will be said
later that "the knowledge of मति (mati) is caused by the senses and non-senses"
and "the object of श्रुत (śruta) is non-sensory." Therefore, 'पर' (para) here
refers to the senses, mind, light, instruction, etc., which are external causes.
The meaning is that the knowledge of मति (mati) and the knowledge of श्रुत
(śruta) arise in the soul, which is dependent on the destruction and cessation
of the karmas that obscure them, and which is dependent on the external causes
of the senses, mind, light, instruction, etc.  1. त्यर्थः । .

## Chapter 1  [112 8 176] Chapter 1 [73 brought. Therefore, inference, analogy,
etc. are included in this. 8 175. To explain that all other knowledge except
that which is directly perceived is indirect, the sutra says: "Other than direct
perception is indirect." ||12|| 8176. "Akshnauti, vyaapnoti, jaanaati" - the
soul is Akshya. The knowledge that is constant in the soul, which has attained
the destruction and cessation of the karmas of knowledge, and is free from the
veils, is direct perception. Avadhi-darshan and Kevala-darshan are also Akshya,
and therefore, they are also included in this. This is not a fault, because the
word "knowledge" is implied, which negates the meaning of "darshan". Even though
there are many types of knowledge, they are all Akshya, and therefore, they are
all direct perception. Those that are not Akshya are called indirect. Inference,
analogy, etc. are also not Akshya, and therefore, they are also included in
this.  **Special Note:** In the previous sutra, two types of proofs were
mentioned. It remains to be explained what these two proofs are and how the five
types of knowledge are divided among them. Therefore, the eleventh and twelfth
sutras explain this. The eleventh sutra explains the indirect nature of the
first type of proof and includes mati-gyan and shruti-gyan in it. Others define
indirect knowledge as that which is not the object of the senses. However, in
the Jain tradition, indirectness and directness are considered as the nature of
knowledge, and they are explained accordingly. According to the Jain tradition,
knowledge that is obtained through the help of others, i.e., knowledge that is
obtained through the Akshya, or the soul, is called indirect knowledge. The word
"paroksha" is used in this sense. Mati-gyan and shruti-gyan are both types of
knowledge that cannot be obtained without the help of the senses, mind, light,
and teachings, etc. Therefore, they are both considered indirect. In
philosophical texts, sensory knowledge is mentioned as direct knowledge in a
practical sense. Therefore, this statement should be understood in a formal
sense. Others have defined Akshya as the senses and have called sensory
knowledge as direct perception. In that context, sensory knowledge is written as
direct perception in a practical sense. In reality, all knowledge that is
obtained through means other than the soul is indirect. Inference, analogy,
etc., and all other types of knowledge are also not obtained without the help of
others. Therefore, they are all included in these two types of knowledge, namely
mati-gyan and shruti-gyan. It is important to note that these types of knowledge
are not obtained only through external means. The destruction and cessation of
the karmas of mati-gyan and shruti-gyan are essential for their origin. Without
the soul's ability to do so, these types of knowledge cannot be obtained. When
the soul has this ability, these types of knowledge arise in relation to
external means. This is the essence of the above statement.  8175 The
characteristic of indirect knowledge was stated. To explain that all other types
of knowledge are direct, the next sutra says: "All other knowledge is direct
proof." ||12||  8176 The etymological meaning of the word "Akshya" is:
"Akshnauti, vyaapnoti, jaanaati" - the soul is Akshya. The roots "Akshnauti",
"vyaapnoti", and "jaanaati" have the same meaning, therefore, the meaning of
"Akshya" is the soul. Thus, the knowledge that is constant in the soul, which
has attained the destruction and cessation of the veils, and is free from the
veils, i.e., the knowledge that is not obtained through external means such as
the senses, but only through the soul that has attained the destruction and
cessation of the veils, is called direct perception.  **Doubt:** Avadhi-darshan
and Kevala-darshan are also Akshya, i.e., they are also constant in the soul.
Therefore, they are also included in the meaning of the word "direct
perception".  **Solution:** This is not a fault, because the word "knowledge" is
implied in the context, which negates the meaning of "darshan". 1.-Knowledge is
also constant in the soul.

74] Sarvarthasiddhi [1112 8 176 - It is also possible to accept this
(Vibhangajñana) as a constant. But due to the authority of the term 'Samyak', it
is negated. The term 'Samyak' is carried forward, which makes knowledge
specific, and therefore Vibhangajñana is negated. This is because Vibhangajñana
is the object of opposite meaning due to the rise of Mithyadarshana, and
therefore it is not Samyak. 8177. It may be argued that knowledge generated by
the activity of the senses is direct, and knowledge that is not generated by the
activity of the senses is indirect. This is an inconsistent definition that
should be accepted. This is not correct, because it would lead to the absence of
direct knowledge in an Aapta. If knowledge that is caused by the senses is
considered direct, then an Aapta would not have direct knowledge. For an Aapta
does not have knowledge of objects through the senses. If it is argued that an
Aapta also has knowledge through the senses, then he would not be omniscient. If
it is argued that an Aapta has mental direct knowledge, then due to the effort
of the mind, there would be no omniscience. If it is argued that this is
established by the scriptures, then this is not correct, because the scriptures
are obtained through direct knowledge. 178. If it is argued that there is
another kind of knowledge called Yogiprayaksha, which is divine, then this is
not direct knowledge, because it is not caused by the senses. It is accepted
that whatever is related to each sense is direct knowledge. 8179. Furthermore,
the absence of omniscience is a contradiction of the statement. The knowledge of
this Yogi is either sequential or simultaneous. If it is sequential, then  1.

- Chapter 1 118. It could be that it grasps multiple meanings. If it is due to
the opposite meaning, then the yogi does not have omniscience, because the
knowable is infinite. And if it grasps multiple meanings, then the vow, "Just as
one knowledge does not know two meanings, so two knowledges do not know one
meaning," is negated. 8180. Or the vow, "All formations are momentary," is
negated; because according to your view, one knowledge that exists for many
moments is accepted. For grasping multiple meanings is only in sequence. If it
is simultaneous, then the moment of its birth is only for the attainment of the
self. Because after attaining the self, it is engaged in some action of its own.
If it is like a lamp, then even in the case of its being the object of many
parts, the acceptance of the illuminating and the illuminated is true. Because
of its being beyond alternatives, there is also the implication of its
emptiness. It does not remain. This yogi does not have omniscience, because the
knowable is infinite. And if it grasps multiple meanings simultaneously, then
the vow, "Just as one knowledge does not know two meanings, so two knowledges do
not know one meaning," is negated. $180. Or the vow, "All formations are
momentary," is negated; because according to your view, one knowledge that
exists for many moments is accepted. Therefore, the grasping of multiple objects
is only in sequence. Doubt-The grasping of multiple objects will happen
simultaneously. Solution-At the time of the birth of knowledge, it only attains
its own nature, because any object only engages in its own action after
attaining its own nature. Doubt-Knowledge is like a lamp, therefore both things
will happen simultaneously. Solution-No, because it is accepted that it
illuminates the objects to be illuminated only when it exists for many moments.
If knowledge is considered to be beyond alternatives, then emptiness is
attained. Special Meaning-In this sutra, it is explained which knowledges are
direct. In the context, light is shed on these characteristics in its
commentary. 1. The meaning of the word 'aksha'. 2. The etymology of the word
'pratyaksha'. 3. The meaning of the word 'aksha' and the defects that arise when
the word 'pratyaksha' is defined as the sense organ or mind. 4. Omniscience is
not attained through scripture, but scripture is attained only after direct
knowledge. 5. Discussion of the defects that arise when the definition of direct
knowledge as accepted by the Buddhists is accepted. 6. In the context, how
omniscience is not attained in the case of the Buddhists and how the defect of
negation of the vow arises. The meaning of what is written while clarifying the
third point is that omniscience is not attained by considering direct knowledge
to be caused by the sense organs or mind. The Vedas are capable of giving
knowledge of the past, future, present, distant, subtle, etc. This gives
knowledge of all objects. Therefore, there is no objection to considering sense-
organ-generated knowledge and mind-generated knowledge as direct knowledge. The
Mimamsakas believe this. But their belief is not appropriate, because scripture
cannot be attained without direct knowledge. This is explained by the fourth
characteristic. The Buddhists also consider the meaning of 'aksha' to be the
sense organ and consider sense-organ-generated knowledge to be direct knowledge,
but why their belief is not appropriate is explained by the fifth
characteristic. The remaining statement is easy to understand. 1. 'Kshanika:
sarvasankhara: sthiraanam kuta: kriya. Bhutiesham kriya saiwa karaka saiwa
cocyate.' ... 2. Kshanavatyek-m.

76] **Sarvarthasiddhi** 8181. To understand the specific types of **aviprakara**
(non-differentiation) of the **pramana** (means of knowledge) which is stated in
both places, it is said: **Mati**, **Smriti**, **Sanjna**, **Chinta**, and
**Abhinibodha** are synonyms. ||13|| 8182. 1. Firstly, the knowledge that is
stated, its synonyms should be known; because these are the objects of use
arising from the **avaranakshaya** (destruction of karmic veils) and
**upashama** (sublimation) of **matijnana** (knowledge of the mind), and they
are not used in **shruta** (scriptural knowledge) etc. **Manana** is **mati**,
**smarana** is **smriti**, **sanjnana** is **sanjna**, **chintana** is
**chinta**, and **abhinibodhana** is **abhinibodha**. As far as possible, other
**vigraha** (analyses) should be known. 183. Even though there is a difference
in their nature, they are synonyms due to the strength of usage. For example,
**Indra**, **Shakra**, and **Purandara** are all names for the same
**Shachipati** (Lord of Shachi), even though there is a difference in the
actions of **Indana** etc. If we consider the meaning of these words according
to the **samabhirudha** (common usage) **naya** (principle), then we find a
difference in the meaning of **mati** etc. However, the intended meaning here is
that they do not transcend the use arising from the **avaranakshaya** and
**upashama** of **matijnana**. The word "**iti**" is used to indicate the type.
Thus, these are synonyms of **matijnana**. Or, the word "**mati**" is used to
indicate the object. According to this, the meaning conveyed by **mati**,
**smriti**, **sanjna**, **chinta**, and **abhinibodha** is one and the same.
[1113 § 181 $ 181 **Pramana** is said to have two types: **pratyaksha** (direct
perception) and **paroksha** (indirect perception). Now, we will state the next
**sutra** (aphorism) to explain the specific types of the first type of
**pramana**. **Mati**, **Smriti**, **Sanjna**, **Chinta**, and **Abhinibodha**
are synonyms. || 13u 8182. The knowledge that is stated in the beginning, its
synonyms should be known, because these are the objects of use arising from the
**avaranakshaya** and **upashama** of **matijnana**, and they are not used in
**shruta** etc. **Manana** is **mati**, **smarana** is **smriti**, **sanjnana**
is **sanjna**, **chintana** is **chinta**, and **abhinibodhana** is
**abhinibodha**. As far as possible, other **vigraha** should be known. 8183.
Even though these words have different natures, i.e., even though they are
formed from different roots, they are synonyms due to usage. For example,
**Indra**, **Shakra**, and **Purandara**. Even though there is a difference in
the actions of **Indana** etc., these are all names for the same **Shachipati**.
Now, if we consider the meaning of these words according to the **samabhirudha
naya**, then we find a difference in the meaning of **mati** etc. However, the
intended meaning here is that these **mati** etc. do not transcend the use
arising from the **avaranakshaya** and **upashama** of **matijnana**. In the
text, the word "**iti**" is used to indicate the type, which means that these
**mati** etc. are synonyms of **matijnana**. Or, in the text, the word
"**mati**" is used to indicate the object, which means that the meaning conveyed
by **mati**, **smriti**, **sanjna**, **chinta**, and **abhinibodha** is one and
the same. **Special Note:** This **sutra** gives the synonyms of **matijnana**.
In the **Prakrti Anuyoga** chapter of the **Shatkhandagama**, these are also
given as synonyms of **matijnana**. The only difference is that there, instead
of **vijnana** (knowledge), the term **abhinibodhikjnana** is used, and then its
four synonyms are given: **sanjna**, **smriti**, **mati**, and **chinta**. This
makes it worth considering the view of those who interpret the meaning of
**mati** as present knowledge, **smriti** as remembered knowledge, **sanjna** as
recognition, **chinta** as reasoning, and **abhinibodha** as inference. In
reality, these terms refer to various types of knowledge. 1. **Aadi yaduddishtan

## Chapter 1  **§ 184.** Now, to explain what is the cause of the attainment of
knowledge, the following sutra says:  It (knowledge) is caused by the senses and
the mind. ||14||  **§ 185.** The word "Indra" means "one who rules" or "one who
has power." The word "Indra" also refers to the soul. Although the soul is
inherently capable of knowing, it is unable to perceive objects on its own due
to the obscuring karmas of knowledge. Therefore, the instrument that enables the
soul to perceive objects is called the "Indriya" (sense organ), which is the
"linga" (sign) of the soul. Alternatively, "linga" means "that which reveals the
hidden." According to this, "Indriya" refers to the instrument that reveals the
existence of the subtle soul. Just as smoke reveals the presence of fire,
similarly, the sense organs like touch, etc., reveal the existence of the
knower, because they cannot exist without the soul, the knower. Alternatively,
"Indra" is a name-giving karma. Therefore, the sense organs are created by it.
These sense organs, like touch, etc., will be discussed later.  **§ 186.**
"Anindriya" (non-sense), "Manas" (mind), and "Antahkarana" (inner organ) are
synonyms.  **Doubt:** How can the word "Anindriya" (non-sense) be applied to the
mind, which is the "linga" (sign) of the soul, when the word "Anindriya" negates
the sense?  **Solution:** The word "na" (not) here is used in the sense of
"eeshad" (slightly). It means "slightly sense, slightly non-sense." Just as the
word "anudara" (not having a belly) does not mean the complete absence of a
belly, but rather a slightly smaller belly, similarly, we should understand it
here.  **Doubt:** "Anindriya"

## 78] **Sarvarthasiddhi** [1114 § 186 How is the meaning of "slightly" (ईषद्)
taken here, instead of the meaning of "not at all" (नत्र) in relation to the
non-sensory?  Solution: These senses are the objects of things located in a
fixed place and they remain in that state for a period of time. But the mind,
even though it is the organ of the senses, is not the object of things located
in a fixed place and it does not remain in that state for a period of time. §
187. This is called the inner organ (Antahkarana). It is not dependent on the
senses for its activities like thinking about qualities and defects,
remembering, etc., and it is not perceivable externally like the eye, etc.
Therefore, it is called the inner organ because it is an internal instrument.
Therefore, the meaning of "slightly" (ईषद्) is taken in relation to the non-
sensory, instead of the meaning of "not at all" (नत्र). 8188 Doubt: Why is the
word "that" (तत्) used in the sutra? Solution: The word "that" (तत्) in the
sutra is used to refer to the knowledge of perception (मतिज्ञान). Doubt: The
reference to the knowledge of perception (मतिज्ञान) is made immediately after,
and there is a rule that "the injunction or prohibition applies only to the
immediately following object." Therefore, even if the word "that" (तत्) is not
used in the sutra, the knowledge of perception (मतिज्ञान) is still understood.
Solution: The word "that" (तत्) is used to refer to this sutra and the next
sutra. The knowledge referred to by the words like "perception" (मति), etc., is
caused by the sensory and non-sensory, and its four aspects are apprehension
(अवग्रह), desire (ईहा), aversion (अवाय), and retention (धारणा). Therefore, the
aforementioned fault does not arise. If the word "that" (तत्) is not used, then
the words like "perception" (मति), etc., will refer to the first knowledge, and
the knowledge caused by the sensory and non-sensory will be called "heard
knowledge" (श्रुतज्ञान), and its four aspects will be apprehension (अवग्रह),
desire (ईहा), aversion (अवाय), and retention (धारणा). This will lead to the
connection of an undesirable meaning. Therefore, it is necessary to use the word
"that" (तत्) in the sutra to avoid the connection of this undesirable meaning.
Special Note: This sutra discusses the causes of the origin of the knowledge of
perception (मतिज्ञान), and it mentions two types based on the difference between
the senses and the mind. Although meaning (अर्थ), light (आलोक), etc., are also
causes in the origin of this knowledge, they are not invariable causes, so they
are not mentioned here. This sutra sheds light on the meaning of the words
"sensory" (इन्द्रिय) and "non-sensory" (अनिन्द्रिय), explaining that the senses
are the objects of things located in a fixed place and they remain in that state
for a period of time, while the mind is not the object of things located in a
fixed place and it does not remain in that state for a period of time. 1.

## Chapter 1  **179** [-1158190]  **8189.**  Thus, the cause of the origin of
knowledge has been explained, but its distinctions have not yet been determined.
Therefore, to explain these distinctions, the next sutra says:  **8190.**
**Avagraha, Iha, Avaya, and Dharana are the four distinctions of knowledge.**
||15||  **190.** The first apprehension that occurs after the conjunction of the
object and the subject is called **Avagraha**. When the object and the subject
come together, perception occurs. The apprehension of the object that follows
this is called **Avagraha**. For example, the apprehension of "this is a white
form" by the eye is **Avagraha**.  **Iha** is the desire to know the specific
nature of the object apprehended by **Avagraha**. For example, after seeing the
white form, one may wonder, "Is it a banner or a garland?" This desire to know
the specific nature is **Iha**.  **Avaya** is the knowledge of the true nature
of the object obtained through the determination of its specific
characteristics. For example, through the observation of its origin, fall, and
movement, one may conclude, "It is a garland, not a banner." This certainty is
**Avaya**.  **Dharana** is the cause that prevents forgetting the known object
over time. For example, "This is the same garland that I saw this morning." This
remembrance is **Dharana**.  The order of presentation of these terms in the
sutra follows the order of their origin. This means that the terms are presented
in the sutra in the same order in which they arise in the process of knowledge.
**Special Note:** This sutra describes four distinctions of knowledge. These
distinctions are based on the primary function of knowledge. Therefore, the
cessation of knowledge is also considered to be of these four types. This
statement explains the order in which knowledge apprehends an object. The nature
of these distinctions has already been explained in the commentary.  **Specific
Points:**  1. **Madya graha-mu.** 2. **Marthasy graha-mu.** 3. **Pataket-mu.**
4. **Utpatanapksha-a., di. 1, di. 21** 5. **Arthatasya–mu.** 6. **"Tayanantaraṁ
tayathāvicchavaṇaṁ jo ya vāsaṇajogo. Kālantaraṁ ya jaṁ puṇaranusaraṇaṁ dhāraṇā
sāu." - Vi. Bha. Ga. 291.** 7. **"Īhijjai nāgahiyam najjai nāṇīhiyam na yāvāyaṁ.

## Sarvarthasiddhi  [11168 1918191. To understand the different types of
Avagraha and other concepts, the following sutra is stated - "Setara (along with
its opposite) Bahu, Bahuvidha, Kshipra, Anissruta, Anukta, and Dhruva are the
types of Avagraha, Iha, Avaya, and Dharana forms of Matijnana." ||16|| 8192.
This section deals with specific actions like Avagraha, etc.  The karmakaraka
(object of action) is indicated as "Bahvadi naam Setara naam". The word "Bahu"
can refer to both quantity and abundance. Both meanings are included here as
there is no specific context.  Examples of "Bahu" as a number are: one, two,
many. Examples of "Bahu" as abundance are: much rice, much soup. The word
"Vidha" refers to types. The word "Kshipra" in the sutra is used to indicate
knowledge that is acquired quickly. When a complete object is not revealed, but
only a part is revealed, and the rest remains hidden, it is called "Anissruta".
Here, "Anissruta" means "slightly revealed", hence the word "Anissruta" is used
in the sutra. The word "Anukta" is used to indicate knowledge that is acquired
through implication, whether it is spoken or unspoken. The word "Dhruva" is used
to indicate knowledge that is acquired continuously and truthfully. The word
"Setara" is used to indicate the collection of opposite concepts. 193. There are
twelve types of Avagraha: Bahu's Avagraha, Alpa's Avagraha, Bahuvidha's
Avagraha, Ekavidha's Avagraha, Kshipra Avagraha, Chirena Avagraha, Anissruta's
Avagraha, Nissruta's Avagraha, Anukta's Avagraha, Ukta's Avagraha, Dhruva's
Avagraha, and Adhruva's Avagraha. Similarly, there are twelve types of Iha,
Avaya, and Dharana. All these are generated by the five senses and the mind
individually. Among these, Bahu Avagraha, etc., are caused by the destruction
and pacification of the Matijnana Avarana Karma, while the others are not. Bahu,
etc., are superior, hence they are mentioned first. -1. "Atsyav संख्यावाची.
Tadyatha eko dhau bahu iti." - Pa. Ma. Bha. 114121211 2. "Bahurodano bahu sup

## Chapter 1 [81]  **8194.** What is the difference between *bahu* (many) and
*bahuvidha* (manifold)?  Since both *bahu* and *bahuvidha* imply multiplicity,
what is the distinction? The difference lies in the aspect of *ekaprakara* (one
type) and *nana-prakara* (various types).  *Bahu* does not imply different
types, while *bahuvidha* does.  What is the difference between *ukta* (said) and
*nihsrita* (emanated)?  Since everything that is emanated is also said, what is
the distinction? The difference is that *ukta* refers to the grasping of an
object through the instruction of another, while *nihsrita* refers to the
grasping of an object by oneself.  **195.** Some teachers read the text as
"kshipra-nihsrita" (quickly emanated). They explain it as follows: When one
hears a sound through the ear, one may know that it is the sound of a peacock or
a cuckoo. Another may know it by relying on its form.  **196.** What is the
difference between *dhruva-avagraha* (firm grasping) and *dharana* (retention)?
It is said that at the time of the attainment of *kshayopashama* (cessation of
karmic afflictions), the *avagraha* (grasping) that occurs due to the continuous
stream of pure *parinama* (transformation) remains the same in the first,
second, and subsequent moments, neither decreasing nor increasing. This is
called *dhruva-avagraha*. However, when *kshayopashama* arises from the mixture
of pure and impure *parinama*, the resulting *avagraha* may be of many, few,
manifold, or single types. In other words, there is a fluctuation in its
quantity and quality. This is called *adhruva-avagraha*.  *Dharana*, on the
other hand, refers to the knowledge that prevents forgetting the grasped object.
Therefore, there is a significant difference between *dhruva-avagraha* and
*dharana*.  **8191.** **Doubt:** What is the difference between *bahu* (many)
and *bahuvidha* (manifold)? Since both *bahu* and *bahuvidha* imply
multiplicity, what is the distinction?  **Solution:** The difference lies in the
aspect of *ekaprakara* (one type) and *nana-prakara* (various types).  *Bahu*
does not imply different types, while *bahuvidha* does.  **Doubt:** What is the
difference between *ukta* (said) and *nihsrita* (emanated)?  Since everything
that is emanated is also said, what is the distinction?  **Solution:** The
difference is that *ukta* refers to the grasping of an object through the
instruction of another, while *nihsrita* refers to the grasping of an object by
oneself.  **195.** Some teachers read the text as "kshipra-nihsrita" (quickly
emanated). They explain it as follows: When one hears a sound through the ear,
one may know that it is the sound of a peacock or a cuckoo. Another may know it
by relying on its form.  **8196.** **Doubt:** What is the difference between
*dhruva-avagraha* (firm grasping) and *dharana* (retention)?  **Solution:** At
the time of the attainment of *kshayopashama* (cessation of karmic afflictions),
the *avagraha* (grasping) that occurs due to the continuous stream of pure
*parinama* (transformation) remains the same in the first, second, and
subsequent moments, neither decreasing nor increasing. This is called *dhruva-

single types. In other words, there is a fluctuation in its quantity and
quality. This is called *adhruva-avagraha*.  *Dharana*, on the other hand,
refers to the knowledge that prevents forgetting the grasped object. Therefore,
there is a significant difference between *dhruva-avagraha* and *dharana*.
**Special Note:** These *avagraha* etc. are different types of actions of
knowing through *mati-jnana* (knowledge of perception), and *bahu* etc. are
their respective actions. Therefore, they are mentioned in this sutra in a
concise manner. The meaning is that through *mati-jnana*, objects are grasped,
perceived, rejected, and retained in various ways, such as *bahu* etc. The
nature of these *bahu* etc. and their differences are explained in the
commentary. It seems that during the time of Pujyapada Swami, there were two
readings of this sutra, and it was also explained in two ways, which Pujyapada
Swami himself mentioned. He explained the reading that was more accepted at that
time or the one that he considered the original text. 1. *bahu* and *bahuvidha*.

## Sarvarthasiddhi  **11168 197:**  If Avagraha etc. are the knowers of Bahu
etc., then what is the qualifier of Bahu etc.? To answer this, the next sutra
says:  **_Arthasya_ (Of the object) Avagraha, Iha, Avaya and Dharana, these four
are the types of Matijnana.  ||17||**  **198:** The object of the senses like
eye etc. is called 'Artha'.  It should be understood that Avagraha etc. are of
that 'Artha' which is qualified by Bahu etc.  Doubt: Since Bahu etc. are
themselves 'Artha', why is this sutra said?  Solution: It is true that Bahu etc.
are themselves 'Artha', but this sutra 'Arthasya' is said to refute the theory
of other schools.  Some schools believe that qualities like Rupa etc. are the
ones that come in contact with the senses, and therefore, they are the ones that
are grasped.  But this is not correct, because these qualities like Rupa etc.
are intangible and cannot come in contact with the senses.  Doubt: If this is
the case, then how can we say "I saw the Rupa, I smelled the Gandha"?  Solution:
What is grasped by the senses or what is grasped through the senses is called
'Artha'.  According to this, 'Artha' is the substance.  When it comes in contact
with the senses, since Rupa etc. are inseparable from it, therefore, it is also
possible to say "I saw the Rupa, I smelled the Gandha" in relation to Rupa etc.
**Special Note:** The object of knowledge is neither general nor specific, but a
substance that is both.  The sutra 'Arthasya' is composed to explain this very
point.  This refutes the view of the Nyaya and Vaisheshika schools that
qualities like Rupa etc. come in contact with the senses.  **199:** Are these
Avagraha etc. of all the senses and mind, or is there some difference in
relation to the object?  To answer this, the next sutra says:  **Vyanjanasya
Avagraha (It is the Avagraha of the Vyanjana). ||18||**

[83  1119 8 201] Chapter One 8 200. The term *vyanjana* refers to the unmanifest
state of sound and other objects. Its *avagraha* is the only thing that exists,
not *iha* etc. Why is this? It is to establish a rule, that *avagraha* is the
only thing that exists, not *iha* etc. Should the *evakara* be used in this
sutra? It should not be used, because "when a rule is established, a subsequent
rule is for the purpose of establishing a rule" (Pa. Ma. Bha. 1, 1, 31).
Therefore, even without the *evakara*, the sutra will serve its purpose of
establishing a rule. But, the term *avagraha* is used in both places, so what is
the difference? The difference lies in the *avagraha* of the meaning and the
*avagraha* of the *vyanjana*, in terms of the manifest and unmanifest. How? Like
the formation of a new mountain from water droplets. Just as two or three water
droplets do not make a mountain wet, but when they are repeatedly poured, it
gradually becomes a mountain, similarly, the *pudgalas* that are the form of
sound etc., which are perceived by the senses of hearing etc., do not become
manifest in two or three moments, but become manifest when they are repeatedly
perceived. Therefore, before the perception of the manifest, there is the
*avagraha* of the *vyanjana*, and the perception of the manifest is called
*artha-avagraha*. This is why *iha* etc. do not exist before the perception of
the unmanifest. 8 201. To prohibit the possibility of *vyanjana-avagraha* being
present in all senses without exception, the next sutra says: Not by the eye and
the mind. ||19|| 8200. The unmanifest sound etc. is called *vyanjana*. Its
*avagraha* is the only thing that exists, not *iha* etc. Question-Why is this
sutra? Answer-This sutra is to establish a rule that *avagraha* is the only
thing that exists, not *iha* etc. Question-Then, the *evakara* should be used in
this sutra. Answer-It should not be used, because "when a rule is established, a
subsequent rule is for the purpose of establishing a rule" (Pa. Ma. Bha. 1, 1,
31). Therefore, even without the *evakara*, the sutra will serve its purpose of
establishing a rule. Question-But, the term *avagraha* is used in both places,
so what is the difference? Answer-The difference lies in the *avagraha* of the
meaning and the *avagraha* of the *vyanjana*, in terms of the manifest and
unmanifest. Question-How? Answer-Like the formation of a new mountain from water
droplets. Just as two or three water droplets do not make a mountain wet, but
when they are repeatedly poured, it gradually becomes a mountain, similarly, the
*pudgalas* that are the form of sound etc., which are perceived by the senses of
hearing etc., do not become manifest in two or three moments, but become
manifest when they are repeatedly perceived. Therefore, before the perception of
the manifest, there is the *avagraha* of the *vyanjana*, and the perception of
the manifest is called *artha-avagraha*. This is why *iha* etc. do not exist
before the perception of the unmanifest. Special Note-Here, the unmanifest sound
etc. is called *vyanjana*. But, Vira Sena Swami does not agree with this
definition. According to him, the first perception of the acquired meaning is
called *vyanjana*. On reflection, it is clear that these two definitions are
given due to a difference in perspective. In reality, there is no difference
between them. Both Pujya Pada Swami and Vira Sena Swami agree that the first
perception of the acquired meaning is *vyanjana*. Only Pujya Pada Swami has
given the special epithet "unmanifest" before the word "sound" to explain the
state of the object at the time of the first perception by the senses of touch,
taste, smell, and hearing. But, Vira Sena Swami has not given such a special
epithet. The rest of the statement is easy to understand. $ 201. To prohibit the
possibility of *vyanjana-avagraha* being present in all senses without
exception, the next sutra says: Not by the eye and the mind. ||19|| 1.

## 84] **Sarvarthasiddhi** [119 $202 - 8 202. There is no *vyanjanavagraha*
(perception of the object through its qualities) by the eye and mind. Why?
Because they are *apraapyakari* (not capable of acquiring the object). The eye
perceives an object that is not acquired, is suitable, is situated in a
direction that is suitable, is situated in a place that is suitable for
proximity, and is manifested by external light, etc. The mind also perceives an
object that is not acquired. Therefore, there is no *vyanjanavagraha* by these
two. 8 203. How is it known that the eye is *apraapyakari*? It is known from the
scriptures and reason. From the scriptures, as in: "The ear hears a sound that
is not touched, and the eye sees a form that is not touched. Similarly, the
nose, tongue, and touch senses know the smell, taste, and touch that are not
touched." $ 204. From reason, as follows: The eye is *apraapyakari* because it
does not perceive an object that is touched. If the eye were *praapyakari*
(capable of acquiring the object), it would perceive the *anjana* (collyrium)
that is touched, like the skin sense. But it does not perceive the *anjana* that
is touched. From this, it is known that the eye is *apraapyakari* like the mind.
Therefore, it is established that there is *vyanjanavagraha* by the remaining
senses, excluding the eye and mind. And there is *arthaavagraha* (perception of
the object) by all the senses and the mind.  **Special Note:** Earlier, two
types of *avagraha* (perception) were explained: *arthaavagraha* and
*vyanjanavagraha*. Of these, *arthaavagraha* occurs through all five senses and
the mind, which are six in total. But *vyanjanavagraha* does not occur through
the eye and mind, which are two. This is the meaning of this sutra. The
commentary written to explain why *vyanjanavagraha* does not occur through the
eye and mind states that these two are *apraapyakari*, meaning they do not
perceive the object by touching it. Therefore, *vyanjanavagraha* does not occur
through them. From this, it is automatically inferred that *vyanjanavagraha*
occurs only for an acquired object, and *arthaavagraha* occurs for both acquired
and unacquired objects. It can be said here that if *arthaavagraha* occurs for
an unacquired object, there is no obstacle in that. But how can *arthaavagraha*
occur for an acquired object? The solution to this doubt is that
*vyanjanavagraha* occurs first when an object is acquired, but later,
*arthaavagraha* also occurs for it. The eye perceives an acquired object... 1.

-1120 $ 206] Chapter One [85 $ 205. It is said that the characteristics and
distinctions of *mati-jñāna* have been explained. Now, the characteristics and
distinctions of *śruta-jñāna*, which is the object of this discussion, should be
explained. Therefore, it is said: *Śruta-jñāna* is preceded by *mati-jñāna*, and
it is of two, many, and twelve kinds. ||20|| 8 206. The word "śruta" is
primarily derived from the meaning of "hearing," but due to convention, it also
refers to a particular kind of knowledge. Just as the word "kuśala" is derived
from the meaning of "piercing with a kuśa," but due to convention, it refers to
"paryavādāt" (i.e., pure or pleasing). What is this particular kind of
knowledge? Therefore, it is said, "Śrutaṃ mati-pūrvam." That which fulfills the
proof of *śruta*. According to this derivation, "pūrvam," "nimitta," and
"kāraṇa" are synonymous. The explanation of *mati* has already been given.
*Mati* which is the "pūrvam" (i.e., the cause) of this is called *mati-pūrvam*,
which means "caused by *mati*." The implication is that *śruta-jñāna* is that
which arises from *mati-jñāna*. Doubt: If *śruta-jñāna* is preceded by *mati-
jñāna*, then *śruta-jñāna* also becomes *mati-ātmaka* (i.e., of the nature of
*mati*), because in the world, the effect is seen to be similar to the cause.
Resolution: This is not an absolute rule that the effect is similar to the
cause. Although a pot is produced from a stick, etc., it is not *daṇḍādya-
ātmaka* (i.e., of the nature of a stick, etc.). Secondly, even in the presence
of *mati-jñāna*, *śruta-jñāna* does not occur. Although *mati-jñāna* is present
and the external cause of *śruta-jñāna* is also present, *śruta-jñāna* does not
occur in one who has a strong *śruta-jñāna-āvaraṇa* (i.e., obscuration of
*śruta-jñāna*). But when the *śruta-jñāna-āvaraṇa* karma is significantly
reduced or eliminated, then *śruta-jñāna* arises. Therefore, *mati-jñāna* should
be understood as merely the cause of the origin of *śruta-jñāna*. 1. *Pratītyā

## 86] Sarvarthasiddhi  [1120 8 2076 207. It is said that Shruta-jnana
(knowledge derived from scriptures) is without beginning and end. If it is
considered to be preceded by Mati-jnana (knowledge based on reasoning), then it
would not be without beginning and end, because what has a beginning must have
an end. Therefore, it is argued that Shruta-jnana is not authentic because it is
a product of human effort. This is not a valid objection, because Shruta-jnana
is considered to be without beginning and end based on the general principle of
Dravya (substance) etc. It is not created by any human being at any time or in
any way. Its beginning and end are possible only in relation to specific
principles of Dravya etc., hence it is said to be "preceded by Mati-jnana". Just
as a sprout arises from a seed, it is without beginning and end in relation to
its lineage. Moreover, being non-human in origin is not a reason for
authenticity, because if it were, then the teachings of thieves etc., whose
creators are not remembered, would also be considered authentic. And what is the
contradiction in accepting the authenticity of Pratyaksha (direct perception)
etc., which are impermanent?  $ 208. It is argued that the statement "Shruta-
jnana is preceded by Mati-jnana" is not applicable in the case of the
simultaneous emergence of Samyak-tva (right faith) and knowledge. This is not
correct, because Samyak-tva is not the cause of knowledge. The attainment of the
Self is gradual, therefore there is no contradiction in the statement "Shruta-
jnana is preceded by Mati-jnana".  $ 209. It is argued that the definition
"Shruta-jnana is preceded by Mati-jnana" is not comprehensive, because Shruta-
jnana can also be preceded by Shruta-jnana. For example, a being hears the sound
of words, which are composed of Pudgala-skandhas (aggregates of matter), and
through the ear-sense organ, it acquires knowledge of the words. Subsequently,
it acquires knowledge of a pot, which is the first Shruta-jnana. If it has a
connection with the pot, then after this knowledge of the pot, it acquires
knowledge of other actions like holding water, etc., and then Shruta-jnana
arises from Shruta-jnana. Or, a being perceives the objects of the eye-sense
organ etc. 1. -Shrutakartva-mu. 2. 'Naana-naana-ni ya samkalaai jao maisuyaai.

## Chapter 1  [87 It is sometimes said that knowledge is also a type of faith,
because it is preceded by faith. 8 210. The word "Bhed" (difference) is to be
understood in conjunction with each of the words "two", "many", and "twelve".
There are two types of knowledge: Anga-Bahya (external to the Angas) and Anga-
Pravesht (internal to the Angas). Anga-Bahya has many types, such as Dasha-
Vakalika, Uttara-Adhyayana, etc. Anga-Pravesht has twelve types. These are:
Achar, Sutra-Krit, Sthan, Samavay, Vyakhyan-Prajnapti, Jnatri-Dharma-Katha,
Upasaka-Adhyayana, Antakrid-Dasha, Anuttaraupapaddhika-Dasha, Prashna-Vyakaran,
Vipaka-Sutra, and Drishti-Vad. Drishti-Vad has five types: Pari-Karma, Sutra,
Prathama-Anuyog, Purva-Gat, and Chulika. Of these, Purva-Gat has fourteen types:
Utpad-Purva, Agrayaniya, Virya-Anu-Vad, Asti-Nasthi-Pravad, Gyan-Pravad, Satya-
Pravad, Atma-Pravad, Karma-Pravad, Pratyakhyan-Namadhey, Vidya-Anu-Vad, Kalyan-
Namadhey, Pran-Avyay, Kriya-Vishal, and Lok-Bin-Dusar. Thus, this knowledge is
of two types, many types, and twelve types. 8 211. What is the reason for this
difference? The difference is due to the difference in the speaker. There are
three types of speakers: Sarvagya (omniscient) Tirthankara, or a general Kevali,
and Shruta-Kevali, and Araatiya. Of these, the supreme sage, Sarvagya, is
endowed with the special excellence of the supreme and inconceivable Kevala-
Gyan. Therefore, he has taught the Agam in the form of meaning. He is a direct
witness and free from defects, therefore he is authoritative. His direct
disciples, the Ganadharas, who are endowed with extraordinary intellectual
powers, are Shruta-Kevalis, and they have composed the Angas and the Purva-
Granthas by remembering the Agam in its meaning form. They are authoritative
because of the authority of the Sarvagya. The Araatiya Acharayas, due to the
defect of time, have a shortened lifespan, and they have composed the Dasha-
Vakalika, etc., for the benefit of their disciples who have limited intellect
and strength. Their authority is based on the fact that they are the same as the
original, like milk from the ocean taken in a pot.  After that, he had the first
knowledge of smoke, etc. If he has knowledge of the relationship between smoke,
etc., and fire, etc., then he knows fire, etc., from the cause of smoke, etc.,
and even then, knowledge arises from knowledge. Therefore, isn't it true that
knowledge arises only after faith? Solution: This is not a defect, because where
knowledge arises from knowledge, the first knowledge is considered to be faith
by convention. Knowledge is also sometimes considered to be faith by convention,
because it is a rule that knowledge arises from faith. 8 210. The word "Bhed"
(difference) that appears in the Sutra should be combined with each of the words
"two", "many", and "twelve". For example, two types, many types, and twelve
types. There are two types of knowledge: Anga-Bahya (external to the Angas) and
Anga-Pravesht (internal to the Angas). Anga-Bahya has many types, such as Dasha-
Vakalika, Uttara-Adhyayana, etc. Anga-Pravesht has twelve types. These are:
Achar, Sutra-Krit, Sthan, Samavay, Vyakhyan-Prajnapti, Jnatri-Dharma-Katha,
Upasaka-Adhyayana, Antakrid-Dasha, Anuttaraupapaddhika-Dasha, Prashna-Vyakaran,
Vipaka-Sutra, and Drishti-Vad. Drishti-Vad has five types: Pari-Karma, Sutra,
Prathama-Anuyog, Purva-Gat, and Chulika. Of these, Purva-Gat has fourteen types:
Utpad-Purva, Agrayaniya, Virya-Anu-Vad, Asti-Nasthi-Pravad, Gyan-Pravad, Satya-
Pravad, Atma-Pravad, Karma-Pravad, Pratyakhyan-Namadhey, Vidya-Anu-Vad, Kalyan-
Namadhey, Pran-Avyay, Kriya-Vishal, and Lok-Bin-Dusar. Thus, this knowledge is
of two types, many types, and twelve types. 8211. Doubt: What is the reason for
this difference? Solution: The difference is due to the difference in the
speaker. There are three types of speakers: Sarvagya (omniscient) Tirthankara,
or a general Kevali, and Shruta-Kevali, and Araatiya. Of these, the supreme
sage, Sarvagya, is endowed with the special excellence of the supreme and
inconceivable Kevala-Gyan. Therefore, he has taught the Agam in the form of

extraordinary intellectual powers, are Shruta-Kevalis, and they have composed
the Angas and the Purva-Granthas by remembering the Agam in its meaning form.
They are authoritative because of the authority of the Sarvagya. The Araatiya
Acharayas, due to the defect of time, have a shortened lifespan, and they have
composed the Dasha-Vakalika, etc., for the benefit of their disciples who have
limited intellect and strength. Their authority is based on the fact that they
are the same as the original, like milk from the ocean taken in a pot.  1.
-Rest. The difference is made due to the difference in the speaker. A., Di. 1,

##  All-Purpose Accomplishment  [11208212 8212. The indirect proof has been
explained. Now the direct proof is to be explained. It is of two types - *desh-
pratyaksha* and *sarva-pratyaksha*. *Desh-pratyaksha* is of two types - *avadhi-
jnana* and *manah-paryaya-jnana*. *Sarva-pratyaksha* is only *kevala-jnana*. If
this is so, then the explanation of *avadhi-jnana* mentioned in the beginning of
the three types of *pratyaksha* should be given. Therefore, it is said -
*avadhi-jnana* is of two types - *bha-pratyaya* and *kshaya-upashama-nimitta*.
Among them, the *bha-pratyaya* *avadhi-jnana* is explained in the next verse.
*Bha-pratyaya* *avadhi-jnana* is of the gods and the hell-beings. ॥21॥ 1.

## Chapter One  [89 F213. "Bhava" is said. What is "Bhava"? "Bhava" is the state
of the soul caused by the arising of the karma called "Aayu". "Pratyay",
"Karan", and "Nimitta" are synonymous. The "Bhava Pratyay" is the knowledge of
the Avadhi, Devas, and Narakas, which is the cause of the "Bhava". If this is
so, then the "Kshayopa-shama" does not become the cause of their Avadhi
knowledge. This is not a fault, because the "Kshayopa-shama" is achieved through
the "Bhava". By taking "Bhava" as the object, "Kshayopa-shama" arises, and thus
"Bhava" is considered the main cause. Just as the flight of birds in the sky is
caused by "Bhava", not by special education or qualities, similarly, even in the
absence of vows, rules, etc., Devas and Narakas have Avadhi knowledge, therefore
it is called "Bhava Pratyay". If it is not considered so, then "Bhava" is common
to all, and there would be no difference in the Avadhi knowledge of all. But it
is said that there is a difference in the intensity of Avadhi knowledge. Even
though the term "Devanarakaanaam" is used in a general sense, it only refers to
the Samyagdrstis. Why? Because the term "Avadhi" is used. For the Mithyadrstis,
it is called "Vibhanggyaan". The intensity of Avadhi knowledge in Devas and
Narakas should be known from the scriptures.  214. If "Bhava Pratyay" is the
Avadhi knowledge of Devas and Narakas, then what is the "Kshayopa-shama" caused
Avadhi knowledge? This is explained further.

The **Sarvarthasiddhi** states that there are six types of **avadhi jnana**
(clairvoyance) based on the cause of **kshaya** (destruction of karmas) and
**upasama** (sublimation of karmas), which are experienced by the remaining
beings, namely humans and animals.    **[22]** 8215. When the **deshghati
spardhakas** (enemies of the country) of **avadhi jnana avarana** (veil of
clairvoyance) arise, the **sarvaghati spardhakas** (enemies of all) do not
arise, this is **kshaya**. The **sadavastah** (permanent state) of those who
have attained **anudaya** (non-arising) is **upasama**. These two are the causes
of this, hence **kshayopasama nimitta** (cause of destruction and sublimation).
This should be known for the **sesha** (remaining beings). Who are the
**sesha**? Humans and animals. Among them, it should be known only for those who
have the **samarthyam** (capacity). For those who are **asanjni** (unconscious)
and **aparyaptakas** (inadequate), this **samarthyam** does not exist. Even
among the **sanjnis** (conscious) and **paryaptakas** (adequate), it does not
exist for all. Who then? When the **samyagdarshana** (right faith) and other
**nimittas** (causes) are present, those whose **karma** is **shanta** (calm)
and **kshina** (diminished) have this **upalabdhi** (perception). Even though
**avadhi jnana** is only caused by **kshayopasama**, the term **kshayopasama**
is used in the sutra to establish the rule that only **kshayopasama** is the
cause, not **bhavam** (becoming). This **avadhi** is of six types, why? Because
of the difference between **anugami** (following), **ananugami** (not
following), **vardhaman** (increasing), **hiyaman** (decreasing), **avasthita**
(stable), and **anavasthita** (unstable).   Some **avadhi jnana**, like the
light of the sun, follows its master. Some **avadhi jnana** does not follow, but
like the words of a man who answers a question from a man who has turned away,
it is left behind, the man who has turned away does not receive it. Similarly,
this **avadhi jnana** is also left behind. Some **avadhi jnana**, like the fire
that is born from the churning of wood and grows with the addition of dry
leaves, increases from the amount it is born in, due to the presence of
**samyagdarshana** and other qualities, until it reaches the capacity to know
countless worlds. Some **avadhi jnana**, like the flame of a fire with a limited
supply of fuel, decreases from the amount it is born in, due to the increase in
**sanklesha parinamas** (results of karmas) caused by the loss of
**samyagdarshana** and other qualities, until it reaches the capacity to know
only an infinitesimal part of an angula (finger). Some **avadhi jnana**, like a
**linga** (sign), remains the same amount it is born in, neither decreasing nor
increasing, due to the **avasthana** (state) of **samyagdarshana** and other
qualities.

- 1123 8 218j **Chapter One**  The **avadhi** knowledge arises from the
**kevalajnana** (omniscience) or from the increase or decrease of the
**samyagdarsana** (right faith) and other qualities. It is produced in a certain
quantity and then increases until it reaches the point where it should increase
and decreases until it reaches the point where it should decrease, like the
waves of water driven by the wind. Thus, there are six types of **avadhi**
knowledge.  $ 216. This is how **avadhi** knowledge is explained. Now,
**manahparyaya** knowledge should be explained. To explain its characteristics
along with its types, the following sutra is said: _ **Rijuvipulamati** is
**manahparyaya** knowledge. ||23|| 8 217. **Riju** means **nirvatita**
(fulfilled) and **praguṇa** (virtuous). Question: What is **nirvatita**? Answer:
It is fulfilled by the knowledge of the meaning of the words, body, and mind of
another person. One whose **mati** (intellect) is **riju** is called **riju-
mati**. **Vipula** means **anirvatita** (unfulfilled) and **katilā** (crooked).
Question: What is **anirvatita**? Answer: It is unfulfilled by the knowledge of
the meaning of the words, body, and mind of another person. One whose **mati**
is **vipula** is called **vipula-mati**. **Riju-mati** and **vipula-mati**
together are called **rijuvipulamati**. The word **mati** is used only once
because it is understood. Alternatively, **riju** and **vipula** can be combined
using the **karmadhāraya** compound and then combined with **mati** using the
**bahuvrihi** compound. Even then, the word **mati** is not needed again. This
**manahparyaya** knowledge is of two types: **riju-mati** and **vipula-mati**.
8218. Question: The types of **manahparyaya** knowledge have been explained.
Now, its characteristics should be explained.

92] **Sarvarthasiddhi** [1123 8 218  - The utilization of the self, arising from
the connection with another's mind, due to the absence of the obscurations of
knowledge, their subsidence, and the support of the anga and upanga karmas, is
called **manaḥparyaya** (mental perception).   **Question:** If it is said that
this is **matijñāna** (knowledge of the mind), then what?  **Answer:** The
answer to this has been given earlier. Here, there is only an expectation of the
mind. It is only expected that the meaning established in another's mind is
known by this.   In this, **ṛjūmati** (straight-minded) **manaḥparyaya**
perceives two or three **bhavas** (existences) in the past, and seven or eight
**bhavas** in the future, with respect to time. With respect to space, it
perceives the extent of a **gavyu** (a measure of distance) in the past, and the
interior of a **yojana** (a measure of distance) in the future, not beyond.
**Vipulmati** (wide-minded) **manaḥparyaya** perceives seven or eight **bhavas**
in the past, and countless **bhavas** in the future, with respect to time. With
respect to space, it perceives the extent of a **yojana** in the past, and the
interior of a **mānuṣottaraśala** (a mountain beyond the human realm) in the
future, not beyond.  219. To further explain the difference between these two,
the following sūtra is stated:  **viśuddhyāpratipātābhyāṁ tadviśeṣaḥ ||24||**
[The difference between these two is due to purity and non-perception.]  8220.
When the obscurations of knowledge and their subsidence are present, there is
purity in the self. **Pratipatana** (perception) is **pratipāta** (non-
perception).   **Manaḥparyaya** is the knowledge that arises in the self due to
the connection with another's mind, from the subsidence of the obscurations of
knowledge and the support of the **anga** and **upanga** karmas.   **Question:**
This knowledge arises from the connection with the mind, so does it become
**matijñāna** (knowledge of the mind)?  **Answer:** No, because the answer to
this question has been given earlier. That is, here there is only an expectation
of the mind. It is only expected that the meaning established in another's mind
is known by this.   Of these, **ṛjūmati** **manaḥparyaya** perceives two or
three **bhavas** (existences) in the past, and seven or eight **bhavas** in the
future, with respect to time. With respect to space, it perceives the extent of
a **gavyu** (a measure of distance) in the past, and the interior of a
**yojana** (a measure of distance) in the future, not beyond.   **Vipulmati**
**manaḥparyaya** perceives seven or eight **bhavas** in the past, and countless
**bhavas** in the future, with respect to time. With respect to space, it
perceives the extent of a **yojana** in the past, and the interior of a
**mānuṣottaraśala** (a mountain beyond the human realm) in the future, not
beyond.

## Chapter 1 [93  **Non-fall (A-pratipat) and Fall (Pratipat)**  For a being
with subdued passions, the peak of restraint (Samyama) falls due to the arising
of passions, resulting in a fall (Pratipat). For a being with weakened passions,
there is no cause for a fall, hence non-fall (A-pratipat).  **Purity (Vishuddhi)
and Non-fall (A-pratipat)**  Purity (Vishuddhi) and non-fall (A-pratipat) are
both forms of pure non-fall (Vishuddhi-A-pratipat). There is a difference
between these two, which is their specific characteristic (Tadvishesha).
**Purity (Vishuddhi)**  Purity (Vishuddhi) is purer in terms of substance,
space, time, and state, with respect to both direct perception (Rjumati) and
vast perception (Vipulmati).  **How?**  The final infinite part of the karmic
substance, which is the object of omniscience, when further divided infinitely,
the final part obtained is the object of direct perception (Rjumati). And when
this object of direct perception (Rjumati) is further divided infinitely, the
final part obtained is the object of vast perception (Vipulmati). This is
because infinity has infinite divisions.  Thus, purity (Vishuddhi) is said to be
in terms of substance, space, and time. Purity (Vishuddhi) in terms of state
should be understood as being the object of increasingly subtle substances, due
to the increasingly refined destruction and pacification of passions.  **Non-
fall (A-pratipat)**  Non-fall (A-pratipat) is also distinguished by vast
perception (Vipulmati), as it is the rising of the character of its possessors.
**Direct Perception (Rjumati)**  Direct perception (Rjumati) is prone to fall
(Pratipati), as it is the rising of the character of its possessors due to the
arising of passions.  **Special Note:**  Here, the difference between the two
types of knowledge (Manas-paryaya) is shown. Direct perception (Rjumati) is
gross knowledge, and vast perception (Vipulmati) is subtle knowledge. This
clarifies the difference between them. This is the purified state. This makes a
difference in the knowledge of the object in terms of substance, space, time,
and state.  However, there is another reason for the difference between these
two types of knowledge, which is called fall (Pratipat) and non-fall
(A-pratipat). Fall (Pratipat) means to fall, and non-fall (A-pratipat) means not
to fall.  It is a rule that vast perception (Vipulmati) is the knowledge of the
Manas-paryaya of those who, while being destined for liberation, ascend to the
category of destruction (Kshapaka), but there is no such rule for direct
perception (Rjumati). It can be the Manas-paryaya of those who are destined for
liberation, as well as others. Similarly, it can be the Manas-paryaya of those
who ascend to the category of destruction (Kshapaka), as well as those who do
not ascend to that category but ascend to the category of pacification
(Upashama) or do not ascend at all.  Therefore, direct perception (Rjumati) is
considered prone to fall (Pratipati), and vast perception (Vipulmati) is
considered non-fall (A-pratipati). This characteristic is due to merit, hence it
is mentioned separately.  **§ 221. If this Manas-paryaya knowledge has this
distinct difference, then what is the reason for the difference between
omniscience (Avadhi) and Manas-paryaya knowledge? Now, to explain this, the next
sutra says...**

## 94] **Sarvarthasiddhi**  **[25]**  There is a difference between Avadhi-jnana
and Mana-paryaya-jnana in terms of **Vishuddhi**, **Kshetra**, **Swami**, and
**Vishaya**.  **[8222]** Vishuddhi means purity. Kshetra is the place where the
object of knowledge is located. Swami is the knower. Vishaya is the object of
knowledge. Avadhi-jnana is purer than Mana-paryaya-jnana because the object of
Avadhi-jnana is more subtle. Kshetra has already been mentioned. Vishaya will be
discussed later. Here, we are considering Swami. Mana-paryaya-jnana is found
only in those beings who have excellent Charitra-guna, from the stage of
Pramatta-samyata to the stage of Kshina-kashya. It arises only in those beings
whose Charitra is increasing, not in those whose Charitra is decreasing. Even in
those beings whose Charitra is increasing, it arises only in those who have
attained one of the seven Riddhis, not in others. Even among those who have
attained Riddhis, it arises only in some, not in all. This is the special
characteristic of Swami, or the specific Samyama, mentioned in the Sutra.
Avadhi-jnana, however, is found in beings of all four Gatis. Therefore, there is
a difference between these two types of knowledge even in terms of Swami.
**[8223]** Now is the time to discuss the definition of Kevala-jnana. However,
before that, we will examine the Vishaya of different types of knowledge. This
is because the definition of Kevala-jnana will be mentioned later in the Sutra:
"Kevala is due to the destruction of Moha, Jnanavaran, Darshanavaran, and
Antaray." If this is the case, then we should first discuss the Vishaya of Mati-
jnana and Shruta-jnana, which were mentioned earlier. Keeping this in mind, the
next Sutra says:  **[26]** Mati-jnana and Shruta-jnana are related to all
substances, with some exceptions.  **[8224]** The word Nibandha means
"connection" or "relation." What is connected? The Vishaya. Should the Vishaya
be mentioned in the Sutra? No, it is already implied. Where is it implied? In
the phrase "Vishuddhi-Kshetra-Swami-Vishayebhyah." Therefore, based on the
meaning of this phrase, there is a difference between Avadhi-jnana and Mana-
paryaya-jnana in terms of Vishuddhi, Kshetra, Swami, and Vishaya.

## Chapter One  [95] This chapter deals with the subject of the outcome of
devotion. The word "द्रव्येषु" (dravyeṣu) in the plural refers to the collection
of all living beings, their virtues and vices, as well as time, space, and
matter. The term "असर्वपर्यायेषु" (asarvaparyayeṣu) is used to qualify these
substances. These substances, when they become the object of perception and
scriptural knowledge, are only attained by a few categories, not by all
categories, and not even by infinite categories. Here it is said: The subtle
objects like the dharma-āstikāya, etc., are beyond the senses. Perception does
not operate on them. Therefore, it is not appropriate to say that perception
operates on all substances. This is not a fault; there is a faculty called the
"अनिन्द्रिय" (anindriya). Its object is not attained through the senses, but
through the cessation of the obscurations of the senses, the calming of the
karmas, and the attainment of the fruits. This kind of use, in the form of
grasping, etc., arises beforehand. Therefore, the scriptural knowledge that
precedes it operates on these objects, which are suitable for it. 8225. Now,
what is the object of the knowledge of clairvoyance, which is worthy of infinite
description? This is explained in the following sūtra:  "Clairvoyance operates
on objects that have form." ||27|| 8226. The term "विषयनिबन्धः"
(viṣayanibandhaḥ) is carried over from the previous sūtra. The word "रूपिषु"
(rūpiṣu) refers to matter and living beings bound to matter. This sūtra
establishes the rule that "clairvoyance operates on objects that have form, not
on those that do not." Even though it operates on objects that have form, it
does not operate on all their categories, but only on those that are suitable
for it. This is why the term "असर्वपर्यायेषु" (asarvaparyayeṣu) is used.  8227.
Now, what is the object of the knowledge of mind-reading, which is also worthy
of infinite description? This is explained in the following sūtra:  "Mind-
reading operates on the infinite parts of the object of clairvoyance." ||28||
Should we do it? Solution: We should not do it, because the term "विषय" (viṣaya)
is taken from the context. Question: Where does it appear in the context?
Solution: It appears in the sūtra "विशुद्धिक्षेत्रस्वामिविषयेभ्यः"
(viśuddhikṣetrasvāmiviṣayeṣu). From there, the term "विषय" (viṣaya) is taken and
its case ending is changed according to the meaning. Therefore, it is taken here
in the sense of the sixth case ending. The word "द्रव्येषु" (dravyeṣu) in the
plural is used to refer to the collection of all substances, including living
beings, matter, virtue, vice, space, and time. The term "असर्वपर्यायेषु"
(asarvaparyayeṣu) is used to qualify all these substances. All these substances,
when they become the object of perception and scriptural knowledge, are only
attained by a few categories, not by all categories, and not even by infinite
categories. Question: The subtle objects like the dharma-āstikāya, etc., are
beyond the senses. Perception does not operate on them. Therefore, it is not
appropriate to say that perception operates on all substances. Solution: This is
not a fault; there is a faculty called the "अनिन्द्रिय" (anindriya). Its object
is not attained through the senses, but through the cessation of the
obscurations of the senses, the calming of the karmas, and the attainment of the
fruits. This kind of use, in the form of grasping, etc., arises beforehand.
Therefore, the scriptural knowledge that precedes it operates on these objects,
which are suitable for it.  225. Now, what is the object of the knowledge of
clairvoyance, which is worthy of infinite description? This is explained in the
following sūtra:  "Clairvoyance operates on objects that have form." ||27||

The dravya which is the object of all avadhi jnana, when divided into infinite
parts, one part becomes the object of manahparyaya jnana. 8 229. Now, at the
end, what is called kevalajnana, what is its object? To this, the sutra says:
Kevalajnana is active in all dravyas and their all paryaya. ||29|| 6230. The
word "dravya" and "paryaya" are in a dvandva samasa, meaning both are connected.
The word "sarva" modifies both, meaning all dravyas and all paryaya. Jiva
dravyas are infinite, and pudgala dravyas are even more infinite, differentiated
by their anu and skandha. Dharma, adharma, and akasha are three, and kala is
innumerable. Their paryaya are also infinite in all three times. There is no
dravya or group of paryaya that is beyond the object of kevalajnana. To indicate
the infinite greatness of kevalajnana, the sutra says "sarvadravya paryayeṣu".
Special Note: Here, in four sutras, the object of all five jnanas is indicated.
Mati jnana and shruti jnana are active with the help of five senses and mind,
this is clear, therefore their object can only be mati padartha. But mind,
through its vikalpa, knows both rupa and arupa padartha, therefore the object of
these two jnanas is said to be six dravyas and some of their paryaya. Avadhi
jnana, although active without external help, is still kshayopaśamika, therefore
its object can only be murta padartha. Therefore, the object of avadhi jnana is
said to be rupa padartha. Manahparyaya jnana is also kshayopaśamika, therefore
its object is also rupa padartha, but it perceives rupa padartha through the
paryaya of mind, therefore its object is said to be an infinite part of the
object of avadhi jnana. And kevalajnana is nirvarana, therefore its object is
said to be all dravyas and their all paryaya. 8231. The object of mati etc. is
determined, but it is not known how many jnanas are simultaneously present in
one atman, due to the arising of vritti from its own cause.  1. Yadupi-Di. 1,

Translation preserving Jain terms:  The First Chapter The Divisible Ones are to
be Divided Simultaneously in Four [Modes] ॥30॥  232. The word 'Eka' (one) is a
numerical term, and the word 'Adi' (first) is a term denoting a part. Those
whose first is one are called Ekadini (the first ones). 'Bhajyani' means 'should
be divided'. The meaning is that in one atma (self), simultaneously from one
knowledge up to four knowledges can arise. For example, if there is one
knowledge, then it is Kevalajnana (omniscience). Along with it, other
Ksayopasamika (partially destroyed and partially subsided) knowledges cannot
simultaneously exist. If there are two, then they are Matijnana (sensory
knowledge) and Shrutajnana (scriptural knowledge). If there are three, then they
are Matijnana, Shrutajnana, and Avadhijnana (clairvoyance) or Matijnana,
Shrutajnana, and Manahparyayajnana (telepathy). And if there are four, then they
are Matijnana, Shrutajnana, Avadhijnana, and Manahparyayajnana. There cannot be
five simultaneously, because Kevalajnana is independent.

authority of *samyak darshan*. The word 'cha' indicates a collective meaning.
Therefore, *mati*, *shruta*, and *avadhi* are also *viparaya* and *samyak*

with its juice. Now, it is said that the taste of milk changes due to the defect
in the base (bitter gourd). But this is not the case with *mati*, *jnana*, etc.,
in their perception of the object. For, just as *samyak drishti* perceives
forms, etc., through the eyes, etc., so also *mithya drishti* perceives forms,
etc., through *mati jnana*. Just as *samyak drishti* knows and describes forms,
etc., through *shruta*, so also *mithya drishti* knows and describes forms,

## Chapter 1  [99]  It happens. Sometimes, one may perceive that form, etc., is
real, or that the unreal is real. Sometimes, one may mistakenly conclude that
the real is real and the unreal is unreal. This happens due to the rise of false
perception. Just as a person with a mind clouded by bile may consider his mother
to be his wife and his wife to be his mother. Even if, by chance, he considers
his mother to be his mother and his wife to be his wife, that knowledge is not
correct knowledge. Similarly, one should understand that there is a
misconception about form, etc., in terms of perception, etc. For example, some
false perception-induced consequence, residing in the self, generates a
misconception about the cause, a misconception about difference and non-
difference, and a misconception about the nature itself, even when there is a
true perception of form, etc.  237. **Misconception about the cause:** Some
believe that there is one cause for form, etc., which is formless and eternal.
Others believe that there are atoms of different categories, such as earth,
etc., which have four, three, two, and one qualities, respectively, and they are
the originators of their respective categories of effects. Others describe that
there are four elements, earth, etc., and their physical properties are color,
smell, taste, and touch. The combination of these is called a form atom or an
octet. Others describe that earth, water, fire, and air are the originators of
effects, with atoms of different categories, having qualities like hardness,
etc., fluidity, etc., heat, etc., and movement, etc., respectively.  238.
**Misconception about difference and non-difference:** The belief that the
effect is completely different from the cause or completely non-different from
the cause.  239. **Misconception about the nature:** Form, etc., are either
without any characteristics, or they do not exist at all, or the knowledge that
has transformed into the form of form, etc., is its object, and there is no
external object.   Thus, due to the special characteristics of other
misconceptions, which are contrary to what is seen and heard, one accepts things
according to one's desires, leading to misconception. Sometimes, one may say
that form, etc., exist, even though they do exist. And sometimes, one may say
that something that does not exist, exists. Sometimes, one may consider the real
to be real and the unreal to be unreal. All these conclusions arise from the
rise of false perception. Just as a person with a mind clouded by bile may
consider his mother to be his wife and his wife to be his mother. Even if, by
chance, he considers his mother to be his mother and his wife to be his wife,
that knowledge is not correct knowledge. Similarly, one should understand that
there is a misconception about form, etc., in terms of perception, etc. For
example, some false perception-induced consequence, residing in the self,
generates a misconception about the cause, a misconception about difference and
non-difference, and a misconception about the nature itself, even when there is
a true perception of form, etc.

## 100] Sarvarthasiddhi  [1132 6 239] Due to the rise of Mithyadarshana, they
make assumptions and generate faith in them. From this, there arises Matyajnan,
Shrutajnan, and Vibhangajnan. Samyakdarshan, on the other hand, generates faith
in the understanding of the true meaning of the Tattvas. From this, there arises
Matijnan, Shrutajnan, and Avadhijnan.  8 240. It is said that there are two
types of Pramanas. The parts of Pramana are called Nayas. They should be
explained after the Pramanas. Therefore, the next Sutra says:  Naigama,
Sangraha, Vyavahara, Rijusutra, Shabda, Samabhirudha, and Evambhuta are the
seven Nayas. ||33||  8 241. Their general and specific characteristics should be
explained. The general characteristic is that the application of a Nay is the
one that, without contradiction, leads to the attainment of the true nature of
the specific Sadhya, based on the main reason in a multi-faceted object. It is
of two types: Dravyarthic and Paryayarthic. Dravya means general, Utsarga, and
Anuvritti. The Nay that deals with this is called Dravyarthic Nay. Paryaya means
specific, Apavada, and Vyavritti. The Nay that deals with this is called
Paryayarthic Nay. The further divisions of these two Nayas are Naigama, etc.  8
242. Now, their specific characteristics are explained: Naigama is the Nay that
grasps only the concept in the unmanifested meaning. For example, seeing a man
carrying a sword in his hand, another man thinks: 1. -Jnanam Avadhijnan - Mu. 2.
-Vanaprayo - Mu.

## Chapter 1  **1133 8 244]**  Someone asks a person going with an axe in hand,
"Why are you going?" He replies, "To bring wood." At that time, the word "wood"
is not present in the context. The act of going is only based on the intention
to bring wood. Similarly, someone asks a person busy collecting fuel and water,
"What are you doing?" He replies, "I am cooking rice." At that time, the word
"rice" is not present in the context. It is used in the context of the action of
cooking rice. This kind of worldly interaction, based only on intention without
the actual object being present, is not the domain of the **Naigama Naya**.
**8243.** The **Sangraha Naya** is the principle of taking all things together,
without distinction, by considering their commonality despite their differences.
For example, "being," "substance," and "pot." When we say "being," it
encompasses all things that exist, based on the inference of existence from the
signs of speech and knowledge. Similarly, when we say "substance," it
encompasses all living and non-living things, including their various
categories, based on the etymology of the word "substance" (meaning "that which
flows" or "that which is obtained"). Likewise, when we say "pot," it encompasses
all pots, based on the inference of their existence from the signs of the
concept of a pot and the word "pot." This is another example of the subject
matter of the **Sangraha Naya**.  **244.** The **Vyavahara Naya** is the
principle of applying the things taken together by the **Sangraha Naya** in a
methodical way. What is the method? The method is that the things taken together
by the **Sangraha Naya** are applied in their respective order. For example, the
**Vyavahara Naya** is used to apply the concept of "being" taken together by the
**Sangraha Naya** without considering its specific differences. For example,
"what is being is either substance or quality." Similarly, the **Vyavahara
Naya** is used to apply the concept of "substance" taken together by the
**Sangraha Naya** without considering its specific differences between living
and non-living things. For example, "there is living substance and non-living
substance." As long as living substance and non-living substance remain the
subject matter of the **Sangraha Naya**, they are not considered in their
specific differences.   **1. Sangraha Naya** **2. Sangraha Naya** (abbreviation)

## 102] Sarvarthasiddhi  [1133 8 244]  The term "vyavahar" is used based on
convention.  Since it is not possible to use "vyavahar" for the collection of
both jiva and ajiv, each is considered separately, such as dev, narak, etc. for
jiva and ghata, etc. for ajiv. This principle applies until there is no further
division possible.  [8 245]  The principle of "Riju Sutra" means to accept what
is straight or simple. This principle accepts only the objects of the present
time, not the objects of the past or future. This is because the past is
destroyed and the future is not yet born, so there is no "vyavahar" for them.
The present time is just a moment, and this "Riju Sutra" principle deals only
with the objects of that moment.  **Question:**  Doesn't this lead to the
disappearance of "vyavahar"?  **Answer:** No, because this principle only shows
the object of the principle. "Vyavahar" is achieved by the collective effort of
all principles.  [8 246]  The principle of "Shabda Nay" aims to eliminate the
errors in ling, sankhya, sadhan, etc.  **Ling Vyabhichar:**  For example,
"Pushya, Taraka, Nakshatra" are words with different lingas. Using them together
is "Ling Vyabhichar".  **Sankhya Vyabhichar:**  For example, "Jal, Apah, Varsha,
Ritu, Amra, Van, Varana, Nagar" are words with singular and plural endings.
Using them in a way that violates their singular/plural nature is "Sankhya
Vyabhichar".  **Sadhan Vyabhichar:**  For example, "Sena parvatam adhivasati"
(The army resides on the mountain). Here, the seventh case ending (for the
object of the preposition) is not used, but the second case ending is used,
which is "Sadhan Vyabhichar".  **Purusha Vyabhichar:**  For example, "Ehi manye
rathena yasyasi, na hi yasyasi, yataste pita" (Come, you think I will go by
chariot, you will not go, your father has gone). Here, "manyase" is replaced by
"many" and "yasyami" is replaced by "yasyasi", which is "Purusha Vyabhichar".
**Kal Vyabhichar:**  For example, "Vishvadrushva asya putro janita"
(Vishvadrushva will be his son). Here, "Vishvadrushva" is used as the subject,
and "janita" is used as the verb, which is "Kal Vyabhichar". Or, "Bhavikruti
masit" (The future action has happened). Here, the future action is described as
having happened, which is "Kal Vyabhichar".  **Upgraha Vyabhichar:**  [This
section lists examples of "Upgraha Vyabhichar" with references to specific
texts.]

## Chapter 1 [103  **§ 248** It is believed that the *samābhirūḍha* nay is the
one that ascends to multiple meanings. This is because it is established in one
meaning, having transcended multiple meanings. For example, the word "cow" is
used for various meanings like speech, etc., but it is established in the
meaning of "animal." Alternatively, the use of words is for the purpose of
conveying meaning. In this case, since one meaning is conveyed by one word, the
use of synonyms is pointless. If there is a difference in words, there must be a
difference in meaning. Thus, the *samābhirūḍha* nay is the one that ascends to
multiple meanings. For example, Indra, Śakra, and Purandara are three words with
three meanings. Indra means "possessing authority and power," Śakra means
"powerful," and Purandara means "destroyer of cities." Similarly, it should be
understood everywhere. Alternatively, the *samābhirūḍha* nay is the one that is
established in a particular meaning, having attained it. For example, "Where do
you reside?" "In myself." Why? Because there is no existence of one thing in
another. If it were so, then knowledge, etc., and forms, etc., would exist in
space.  **§ 248** The *evambhūta* nay is the one that establishes the certainty
of a thing in the same way it has been attained. This means that a word is
appropriate only at the moment of the outcome of the action it signifies, and
not otherwise. For example, when it thunders, it is Indra, not the one who
performs the coronation or the one who worships. When it goes, it is as it is -
"it stands, it is established, it rests, it stops." Here, due to the prefixes
"sam" and "pra," the verb "sthā" is used in the *ātmanepada* form, and due to
the prefixes "vi" and "upa," the verb "ram" is used in the *parasmaipada* form.
Therefore, this is a violation of the rules of grammar. Although such usage
occurs in practice, the *śabdanaya* considers it inappropriate because, from the
perspective of the *paryāyārthika* nay, there cannot be a connection between one
meaning and another.  **Doubt:** This contradicts the *lokasamaya* (grammar).
**Solution:** If there is a contradiction, let it be. There is no harm in it,
because here we are discussing the truth. Medicine does not imitate the desires
of a sick man.

## 104] **Sarvarthasiddhi** [1133 § 248 A cow is not standing, nor is it lying
down. Alternatively, the self, by the knowledge by which it has transformed,
determines itself. Just as the self, transformed by the knowledge of Indra and
fire, is Indra and fire. 8249. The Nayas like Naigama etc. have been mentioned.
Their order is due to their being progressively more subtle in subject matter,
and because the earlier ones are the causes of the later ones. Thus, these
Nayas, being progressively opposed in their major subject matter and
progressively more favorable in their minor subject matter, become multi-
faceted, being divided according to the infinite power of the substance. These
Nayas, being primarily based on qualities, are interdependent and are the causes
of right vision. They should be understood as being like threads etc., which are
invested according to their means, and are independent but incapable of
functioning on their own, just as the means of action and the capabilities of
the means of action are for the sake of human purposes. 8250. Objection: The
simile "like threads etc." is inappropriate in the context, because threads
etc., even when independent, do give rise to some function. For example, a
single thread is capable of protecting the skin, and a single strong thread is
capable of binding. But these Nayas, even when independent, do not give rise to
even a little right vision, do they? Solution: This is not a fault, because what
has been said has not been understood. This objection has been raised without
understanding the meaning that has been said. We have said that the function of
cloth etc. is not found in independent threads etc. But what the objector has
pointed out is not the function of cloth etc. Objection: Then what is it?
Solution: It is only the function of threads etc. The function of threads etc.
is also not found in completely independent threads etc., which is the very
point of our argument. Now, it is appropriate to use the word "cloth" in the
context of threads etc., but not at other times. When one has the power of
command and sovereignty, then one is Indra, not when one is being crowned or
worshipped. When a cow is walking, then it is a cow, not when it is sitting or
sleeping. Alternatively, the way in which, or the knowledge by which, the self
has transformed, is the way in which it is determined by that very Naya. For
example, the self transformed by the knowledge of the form of Indra is Indra,
and the self transformed by the knowledge of the form of fire is fire. 8249.
These Nayas like Naigama etc. have been mentioned. Their order is due to their
being progressively more subtle in subject matter, and because the earlier ones
are the causes of the later ones. Thus, these Nayas, being progressively opposed
in their major subject matter and progressively more favorable in their minor
subject matter, become multi-faceted, being divided according to the infinite

-1133 § 250] It is said that it exists in relation to power. Even in the
independent Naya, which is in the form of intellect and expression, there is the
existence of the power of transformation into the cause of right vision due to
the cause, so there is similarity in the existence of the power. This is the
first chapter in the Tattvarthavritti, the explanation of all meanings. First
Chapter It is not found in the components, so it supports our side. If it is
said that the work of cloth etc. in thread etc. is dependent on power, then this
should also be known in the case of intellect and expression - words, which are
independent Naya. Even in them, such power is found, due to which they are able
to transform into the cause of right vision due to the cause, therefore, the
analogy is similar to the analogy.  [105 After stating the differences in the
proofs of special meanings, the Naya is mentioned here. Naya is a type of
Shruta-knowledge, this has already been explained. Here, seven types of Naya are
made based on the predominance of the object. The object can be broadly divided
into three parts, treatment, meaning and word. The first, Naigama Naya, is both
treatment Naya and meaning Naya. Collection, behavior and straight-line are
meaning Naya and the remaining three are word Naya. The idea is that the
tendency of Naigama Naya is mainly from the treatment, therefore, it is mainly
called treatment Naya. However, it is counted in meaning Naya. The tendency of
collection, behavior and straight-line is mainly from the meaning, therefore,
they are called meaning Naya and the tendency of word, common and similar Naya
is mainly from the word, therefore, they are called word Naya. As we have
indicated, Naigama Naya is included in meaning Naya, but there is a fundamental
difference in considering Naigama Naya as meaning Naya from the rest of the
meaning Naya. The point is that it is the work of Naigama Naya to accept the
object from the predominance of treatment, not the rest of the meaning Naya,
therefore, it is called treatment Naya. The rest of the meaning Naya directly
deals with the object from the predominance of difference-in-difference or
general-special, there is no special place for treatment there, therefore, we
have explained Naigama Naya separately from the meaning Naya. Granted, Naigama
Naya also deals with difference-in-difference or general-special in a secondary
way, but treatment works at the root of all these, therefore, Naigama Naya is
mainly treatment Naya. Siddhasena Divakara did not consider Naigama Naya as
Naya, the reason for this is treatment. According to them, it is a question of
how much space is given to treatment in the case of right knowledge. There is a
big difference between object-touching alternatives and alternatives imposed on
the object. It is mandatory to give object-touching alternatives a place in the
category of right knowledge, but if alternatives imposed on the object are given
a place in the category of right knowledge, then there will be no limit to the
state of non-existence, this was a fear, perhaps for this reason, Acharya
Siddhasena Divakara did not mention Naigama in the Naya chapter. But such
treatment, which is helpful in knowing the correct original work from tradition
and which does not cause fear of spreading unrealistic illusions or which does
not make the object known in the opposite way but points to the deepest essence
of the object, is acceptable, considering this, treatment-dominant Naigama Naya
has been given a place in the Naya chapter. This increases the scope of thinking
and helps in classifying the overall thoughts that are the generators of right
knowledge. If the thoughts that come in the category of Naigama Naya are
considered false and completely abandoned - not given a place in the category of
right knowledge, then all the thoughts that lead to non-duality should also have
the same fate. If they help in analyzing the nature of the object, therefore,
they are counted in the category of Naya, then the same thing should be applied
to Naigama Naya. The general and special nature of these Naya is given in the
commentary.

[106] **Sarvarthasiddhi** [1133 § 250  Therefore, this topic is not elaborated
upon here. The **Riju Sutra** **naya** grasps the object through the present
**paryaya** by means of the **naya** itself, and the **Shabdadhika** **naya**
grasps the object through the present **paryayamukha** by means of words.
Therefore, the subject of these **nayas** cannot be duality. This is why, while
explaining the subject of **Shabdanaya**, the **vachya** etc. of words ending in
singular and dual forms etc. used together with adjectives, special qualities
etc. have been declared as not its subject, and while explaining the subject of
**Samabhirudha**, the use of multiple meanings of a single word or multiple
words for a single meaning has been declared as not its subject, because the
**vachya** of a word ending in singular form is different, and the **vachya** of
a word ending in dual form is different. Therefore, **Shabdanaya** cannot grasp
them in a single **vachya** form. Similarly, the meaning of the word "go" as
"cow" is different, and the meaning as "speech" is different. Therefore,
**Samabhirudha** **naya** cannot grasp these meanings through a single word.
Similarly, the subject of all **nayas** should be understood. **Naya** is an
option that touches the object through a part. Like **pramana** knowledge, it
does not touch the entire object. Therefore, **Nirapeksha** **naya** is called
**mithya** and **Sapeksha** **naya** is called **samyak**. A detailed
explanation of this topic and the consideration of the increasing subtlety of
all **nayas** has been done in the original text. Thus, it is certain that there
are seven **nayas** and they are divided into two parts: **dravyaarthic** and
**paryayaarthic**.  Thus ends the first chapter of the **Sarvarthasiddhi**
commentary on **Tattvartha**.

## Chapter Two  $251.$ It is said that the subject matter of Right Faith (Samyak
Darshan) is explained as Jiva (soul) etc. What is the true nature of Jiva, which
is mentioned first? It is said that the true nature of Jiva is **Aupaśamika**,
**Kṣayika**, **Miśra**, **Audayika**, and **Pāriṇāmika**. ||1||  $252.$
**Aupaśamika** is the cessation of the experience of Karma in the soul due to
the cause of its own power. Just as mud settles in water due to the connection
with substances like Kataka etc., similarly, the cessation of the experience of
Karma in the soul is due to the cause of its own power. **Kṣayika** is the
complete cessation of Karma. Just as the mud completely disappears when the
water is transferred to another clean vessel, similarly, the complete cessation
of Karma from the soul is **Kṣayika**. **Miśra** is the state of both cessation
and existence. Just as some mud settles in water due to the connection with
substances like Kataka etc., and some remains, similarly, the state of both
cessation and existence is **Miśra**. **Audayika** is the attainment of the
fruits of Karma due to the cause of substances etc. **Pāriṇāmika** is the
transformation that is caused only by the gain of the nature of the substance.
**Aupaśamika** is the state whose purpose or cause is cessation. Similarly,
**Kṣayika**, **Kṣayopaśamika**, **Audayika**, and **Pāriṇāmika** should be
explained as their derivations. These five states are extraordinary, therefore,
they are called the true nature of Jiva.  $253.$ Since Right Faith is the
subject matter, **Aupaśamika** Right Faith is obtained first among its three
categories, therefore, it is taken first. After that, **Kṣayika** is taken.
Because it is the opposite of **Aupaśamika** and because it is countless times
more than the worldly beings in terms of substance, **Kṣayika** is taken after
**Aupaśamika**. Then, **Miśra** is taken because it is both **Aupaśamika** and
**Kṣayika** and because it is countless times more than both. Because all of
them are infinite in their qualities, **Audayika** and **Pāriṇāmika** are taken
at the end. Here, the dual designation should be made - **Aupaśamika Kṣayika**.

## Chapter Two  [109 to be known. Two, nine, eighteen, twenty-one, and three.
These are the divisions, and these are the divisions of those, or the divisions
of those who have two, nine, eighteen, twenty-one, and three divisions. When the
meaning is in the primary word, then there is a connection with the two, nine,
eighteen, twenty-one, and three divisions of the states of the metaphorical,
etc. Due to the meaning, the case ending changes. When the meaning is in another
word, then only the words ending in the specified case ending are connected, the
states of the metaphorical, etc. are two, nine, eighteen, twenty-one, and three
divisions. The word "in order" is for understanding the number in order. The
metaphorical has two divisions. The destructive has nine divisions. The mixed
has eighteen divisions. The arising has twenty-one divisions. The resultant has
three divisions.]  8256. If this is so, then what are the two divisions of the
metaphorical? To explain this, the next sutra says:  **Right faith and right
conduct.** [3]  257. The characteristics of right faith and right conduct have
been explained before. Doubt: How is it metaphorical? Answer: There are two
divisions of the delusion of conduct: that which is subject to passions and that
which is not subject to passions. Of these, the one subject to passions has four
divisions: anger, pride, deceit, and greed, which have infinite connections. The
delusion of perception has three divisions: right faith, wrong faith, and mixed
faith. The metaphorical right faith arises from the pacification of these seven
natures.  258. Doubt: How can there be pacification of these when the karmic
defilement obtained from the arising of karma of the being who has had wrong
faith from beginningless time remains? Answer: Their pacification is due to the
cause of time, etc. Now, we explain the obtaining of time: A being who is bound
by karma, when the time for the change of half a pudgala remains, becomes fit
for the first attainment of right faith, not before. This is one obtaining of
time. Another is...

## 110] **Sarvarthasiddhi** [213 § 258 **Kalalabdhi** (Time-gain) of Karma-
sthiti (Karma-state). In the case of karmas with **utkrista-sthiti** (superior
state) and **jghanya-sthiti** (inferior state), **Prathama-samyaktv** (first
right faith) is not attained. Where then is it attained? When the **bandha**
(bond) of karmas with **antaḥkoṭikoṭisāgaropamasthiti** (state like an ocean of
countless crores) is about to occur, and due to **vishuddha-pariṇāma** (pure
result), the karmas in **sat-karma** (good karma) are established in a state of
**saṅkhyeya-sāgaropamasahasrāṇāyāma-antaḥkoṭikoṭisāgaropamasthiti** (state like
an ocean of countless crores of thousands of oceans of countless crores), then
the being becomes eligible for **Prathama-samyaktv**. Another **kalalabdhi** is
in relation to **bhavy** (being destined for liberation). A **bhavy** who is
**pañcendriya** (five-sensed), **saṅjñī** (conscious), **paryāpta**
(sufficient), and **sarvavishuddha** (completely pure) attains **Prathama-
samyaktv**. The word "**ādi**" (beginning) includes **jātismaraṇa**
(recollection of birth) etc. 8 259. **Aupaśamika** (pacifying) **cāritra**
(conduct) arises from the pacification of all **mohaniya** (delusive) karmas.
Among these, **samyaktv** is placed first because **cāritra** follows
**samyaktv**. 8 260. To explain the different forms of the nine types of
**kṣāyika** (destructive) **bhāva** (state), the next sūtra says: **Kṣāyika**
**jñāna**, **kṣāyika** **darśana**, **kṣāyika** **dāna**, **kṣāyika** **lābha**,
**kṣāyika** **bhoga**, **kṣāyika** **upabhoga**, **kṣāyika** **vīrya**,
**kṣāyika** **samyaktv**, and **kṣāyika** **cāritra** are the nine types of
**kṣāyika** **bhāva**. ॥4॥ 8261. The word "**ca**" (and) in the sūtra is used to
include **samyaktv** and **cāritra**. When **jñāna-āvaraṇa** (knowledge-
obscuring karma) is completely destroyed, **kevala-jñāna** (omniscience) is
attained. The being becomes eligible for **Prathama-samyaktv** when there is a
certain amount of time remaining. It is not attained when there is more time
remaining. This is one type of **kalalabdhi**. Another **kalalabdhi** is related
to **karma-sthiti**. **Prathama-samyaktv** is not attained when there is a
remaining **utkrista-sthiti** karma or a remaining **jghanya-sthiti** karma.
**Doubt:** Then in what state is it attained? **Solution:** When the **bandha**
of karmas with **antaḥkoṭikoṭisāgaropamasthiti** is about to occur, and due to
**vishuddha-pariṇāma**, the karmas in **sat-karma** are established in a state
of **saṅkhyeya-sāgaropamasahasrāṇāyāma-antaḥkoṭikoṭisāgaropamasthiti**, then the
being becomes eligible for **Prathama-samyaktv**. One **kalalabdhi** is in
relation to **bhavy**. A **bhavy** who is **pañcendriya**, **saṅjñī**,
**paryāpta**, and **sarvavishuddha** attains **Prathama-samyaktv**. The word
"**ādi**" includes **jātismaraṇa** etc. 8 259. **Aupaśamika** **cāritra** arises
from the pacification of all **mohaniya** karmas. Among these, **samyaktv** is
placed first because **cāritra** follows **samyaktv**. **Special Note:**
**Aupaśama** (pacification) is of two types: **karaṇopaśama** (pacification
through action) and **akaraṇopaśama** (pacification through inaction).
**Karaṇopaśama** is the pacification of karma through its **antarakaraṇa**
(internalization). This type of **upaśama** occurs only for **darśana-mohaniya**
(delusive karma of perception) and **cāritra-mohaniya** (delusive karma of
conduct). Therefore, only two types of **upaśama** are mentioned. However, there
is a special point: **ananta-anubandhi** (infinitely connected) **caturṣka**
(fourfold karma) does not undergo **antarakaraṇa** **upaśama**. Therefore,
wherever the pacification of **ananta-anubandhi** **caturṣka** is mentioned, it
should be understood as **anudaya-upaśama** (pacification through non-arising).
The **aupaśamika** **samyagdṛṣṭi** (right vision) undergoes **antarakaraṇa**
**upaśama** for **darśana-mohaniya**, and **anudaya-upaśama** for **ananta-
anubandhi** **caturṣka**. This is the meaning of the statement. In the present
context, four qualifications are mentioned to indicate the eligibility of the
being who attains **aupaśamika** **samyaktv**. The special point is this: the
first qualification is related to the time of **ardha-pudgala-parivartana**
(half-pudgala transformation). Only a being who has this much time remaining in
**saṃsāra** (cycle of birth and death) can attain **samyagdṛṣṭi** (right vision)
for the first time. However, there is no rule that **samyagdṛṣṭi** must be
attained when this much time remains. It is certain that **samyagdṛṣṭi** will
not be attained before this time. I 8260. To explain the different forms of the
nine types of **kṣāyika** **bhāva**, the next sūtra says: The nine

## Chapter Two  **111. Kṣayika and Kevala-darśana**  Kṣayika abhayadāna is a
gift of fearlessness that benefits an infinite number of beings due to the
complete destruction of the dāna-antarāya karma. Kṣayika lābha is the benefit
that arises from the complete destruction of the lābha-antarāya karma, which
allows the Kevalis, free from the act of eating morsels, to constantly receive
an infinite number of subtle, supremely auspicious, and extraordinary atoms that
strengthen their bodies, which are not common to other humans. Kṣayika bhoga is
the infinite and extraordinary enjoyment that arises from the complete
destruction of the bhoga-antarāya karma, which manifests as extraordinary events
like showers of flowers. Kṣayika upabhoga is the infinite enjoyment that arises
from the complete destruction of the upabhoga-antarāya karma, which manifests as
extraordinary possessions like thrones, fly whisks, and three umbrellas. Kṣayika
vīrya is the infinite strength that arises from the complete destruction of the
vīrya-antarāya karma. Kṣayika samyaktva arises from the complete destruction of
the seven aforementioned natures. Kṣayika cāritra is similar.  **Doubt:** If
kṣayika dāna, etc., are the causes of abhayadāna, etc., then wouldn't these also
occur in the Siddhas?  **Resolution:** This is not a fault, because the
occurrence of abhayadāna, etc., requires the presence of the śarīra-nāma karma
and tīrthankara-nāma karma. Since these karmas are absent in the Siddhas,
abhayadāna, etc., do not occur in them.  **Doubt:** How then can kṣayika dāna,
etc., be present in the Siddhas?  **Resolution:** Just as the Siddhas possess
infinite strength through kevala-jñāna, they possess kṣayika dāna, etc., in the
form of supreme bliss and freedom from obstacles.  **Special Note:** There are
four types of ghātika karmas: jñāna-āvaraṇa, darśana-āvaraṇa, mohanīya, and
antaya. The absence of jñāna-āvaraṇa results in kṣayika jñāna, the absence of
darśana-āvaraṇa results in kṣayika darśana, the absence of mohanīya results in
kṣayika samyaktva and kṣayika cāritra, and the absence of antaya results in
kṣayika dāna, etc. These five are called the five attainments. This is why there
are nine types of kṣayika. Although the absence of aghatika karmas manifests
kṣayika qualities like aguru, laghu, etc., in the jīva, they are not considered
here because they are not anujīvī.  **Question:** In the commentary, it is
stated that kṣayika dāna, etc., require the presence of śarīra-nāma karma and
tīrthankara-nāma karma. How appropriate is this statement?  **Answer:** This is
a cause-and-effect relationship. When a tīrthankara is in the womb, six months
before his birth, the gods, out of devotion, come to the city where the
tīrthankara will be born and deposit jewels.   1.  **yasyātyantābhā-mu** 2.

## 1121 Sarvarthasiddhi -214 $ 262] 8 262. The eighteen types of
*kshayopashamaka* (pacifying of karmas) are explained in the following sutra,
for the purpose of elucidating their distinctions: There are four types of
*jnana* (knowledge), three types of *ajnana* (ignorance), three types of
*darshan* (perception), and five types of *labdhi* (attainments) such as *dana*
(charity), *samyaktv* (right faith), *charitra* (right conduct), and *samyama-

three, and five types. Those with four, three, three, and five types are called
so. The word "yathkramam" (in order) is understood here, which connects the
four, three, three, and five with *jnana* (knowledge) etc. in order. Thus, there
are four types of *jnana* (knowledge), three types of *ajnana* (ignorance),
three types of *darshan* (perception), and five types of *labdhi* (attainments).

## Chapter One  **[215 8 263]**  The state of *kshaya-upashama* (diminution and
pacification) arises when the *desha-ghati* (destructive) *spardhakas*
(competitors) arise due to the diminution and pacification of the *anantanu-
bandhi* (infinitely connected) *kshayas* (passions). Here, the functioning of
*jnana* (knowledge) etc. should be explained in terms of the diminution and
pacification of their respective *avaranas* (coverings) and *antarayas*
(obstacles). The term *samyak-tva* (rightness) refers to *vedaka* (knowing)
*samyak-tva*.   *Samyak-tva* becomes *kshaya-upashama* when the four *anantanu-
bandhi* *kshayas*, *mithyatva* (falsehood) and *samyag-mithyatva* (partially
true falsehood), arise and diminish, and their pacification leads to the rise of
the *desha-ghati* *spardhaka* *samyak-tva*.  *Charitra* (conduct) becomes
*kshaya-upashama* when the twelve *kshayas* of the *anantanu-bandhi*,
*apratyakhyana-avaran* (non-rejection covering) and *pratyakhyana-avaran*
(rejection covering) arise and diminish, and their pacification leads to the
rise of one of the four *sanjvalana* (burning) *kshayas* as a *desha-ghati*
*spardhaka*, and the nine *no-kshayas* (non-passions) arise as much as possible,
resulting in the cessation of the cycle of rebirth.  *Samyama-asamyama* (control
and lack of control) becomes *kshaya-upashama* when the eight *kshayas* of the
*anantanu-bandhi* and *apratyakhyana-avaran* arise and diminish, and their
pacification leads to the rise of the *pratyakhyana-avaran* *kshaya* and one of
the *sanjvalana* *kshayas* as a *desha-ghati* *spardhaka*, and the nine *no-
kshayas* arise as much as possible, resulting in the cessation or non-cessation
of the cycle of rebirth.  **Labdhis (Attainments)**  In the present time, the
*kshaya-upashama* state arises when the *desha-ghati* *spardhakas* are
diminishing, and their pacification is expected in the future, while the *desha-
ghati* *spardhakas* continue to arise.  It should be understood that the
aforementioned states arise due to the diminution and pacification of their
respective *avaranas* and *antarayas*. The term *samyak-tva* in the sutra refers
to *vedaka* *samyak-tva*.  The meaning is that when the four *anantanu-bandhi*
*kshayas*, *mithyatva* and *samyag-mithyatva*, arise and diminish, and their
pacification leads to the rise of the *desha-ghati* *spardhaka* *samyak-tva*,
the resulting *tattva-artha-shraddha* (faith in the true meaning) is *kshaya-
upashama* *samyak-tva*.  When the twelve *kshayas* of the *anantanu-bandhi*,
*apratyakhyana-avaran* and *pratyakhyana-avaran* arise and diminish, and their
pacification leads to the rise of one of the four *sanjvalana* *kshayas* as a
*desha-ghati* *spardhaka*, and the nine *no-kshayas* arise as much as possible,
the resulting cessation of the cycle of rebirth is *kshaya-upashama* *charitra*.
When the eight *kshayas* of the *anantanu-bandhi* and *apratyakhyana-avaran*
arise and diminish, and their pacification leads to the rise of the
*pratyakhyana-avaran* *kshaya* and one of the *sanjvalana* *kshayas* as a
*desha-ghati* *spardhaka*, and the nine *no-kshayas* arise as much as possible,
the resulting cessation or non-cessation of the cycle of rebirth is called
*samyama-asamyama*.  **Special Meaning**  The *kshaya-upashama* state is
characterized by the diminishing of the *sarva-ghati* (all-destructive)
*spardhakas* in the present time, their pacification expected in the future, and
the continued rise of the *desha-ghati* *spardhakas*.  It is certain that most
*desha-ghati* *karmas* (actions) contain both *desha-ghati* and *sarva-ghati*
*spardhakas*. Only the nine *no-kshayas* and *samyak* *prakriti* (right nature)
are exceptions, containing only *desha-ghati* *spardhakas*. Therefore, *kshaya-
upashama* is possible for all *desha-ghati* *karmas* except the nine *no-
kshayas*, because *kshaya-upashama* requires both types of *karmas* as per the
aforementioned characteristics.  *Samyak* *prakriti* acts as a catalyst in the
creation of the *kshaya-upashama* state, arising from *mithyatva* and *samyag-
mithyatva*. Therefore, there are a total of eighteen types of *kshaya-upashama*
states. For example, there are four *desha-ghati* *prakritis* of *jnana-avaran*
(knowledge covering), and their *kshaya-upashama* leads to the manifestation of
four types of *jnana*. However, there are three types of *ajnana* (ignorance)
due to *mithyatva* and four types of *jnana* due to *samyag-drishti* (right
vision), resulting in a total of seven types of *kshaya-upashama* *jnana*. These
seven types of *jnana* are included in the eighteen *kshaya-upashama* states.
It is clear that there are three types of *darshan* (perception) and five types
of *labdhi* (attainment) in the *kshaya-upashama* state. The remaining three
states are *vedaka* *samyak-tva*,

## 114] Sarvarthasiddhi [216 8 264 _$264. The twenty-one types of *audayika*
(arising) states have been mentioned. To explain their distinctions, this sutra
is uttered. There are four types of *gati* (paths), four types of *kṣaya*
(passions), three types of *linga* (gender), one type of *mithyādarśana* (false
belief), one type of *ajñāna* (ignorance), one type of *asanyama* (non-
restraint), one type of *asiddha* (unrealized), and six types of *leśyā*
(tendencies). ||6|| $ 265. The word 'yathākramam' (in order) is understood here,
as it is relevant. There are four types of *gati*: *narakagati* (hellish path),
*tiryag* *gati* (animal path), *manuṣya* *gati* (human path), and *devagati*
(divine path). Among these, *narakagati* is *audayika* because it arises from
the *karma* (action) called *nāmakarma* (name-karma) which leads to the state of
hell. Similarly, the other three *gati*s should be understood. There are four
types of *kṣaya*: *krodha* (anger), *māna* (pride), *māyā* (deceit), and *lobha*
(greed). Among these, *krodha* is *audayika* because it arises from the *karma*
that produces anger. Similarly, the other three *kṣaya*s should be understood as
*audayika*. There are three types of *linga*: *strīveda* (female gender),
*pumveda* (male gender), and *napumsakaved* (neuter gender). *Strīveda* is
*audayika* because it arises from the *karma* that produces the female gender.
Similarly, the other two genders are *audayika*. There is one type of
*mithyādarśana*. *Mithyādarśana* is *audayika* because it arises from the
*karma* that produces the result of disbelief in the true nature of things.
*Ajñāna* (ignorance) is the lack of knowledge of objects. It is *audayika*
because it arises from the *karma* called *jñānavaraṇa* (knowledge-obscuring
karma). *Asanyata* (non-restraint) arises from the *karma* called
*cāritramohaniya* (character-delusive karma) which is a *sarvaghati* (all-
destructive) *spardhaka* (competitor). Therefore, it is *audayika*. *Asiddha*
(unrealized) arises from the general *karma* of *karma* *udaya* (arising).
Therefore, it is *audayika*. There are two types of *leśyā*: *dravya* *leśyā*
(substance tendency) and *bhāva* *leśyā* (state tendency). Here, *dravya*
*leśyā* is not considered because the *jīva* (soul) has the authority over its
states. *Bhāva* *leśyā* is said to be *audayika* because it is colored by the
arising of *kṣaya* and is the tendency towards *yoga* (liberation). In the
present time, there is no arising, so their arising takes place before the time
of their arising in the form of *spardhaka*s (competitors) or *prakṛti*s
(natures) that are present in the *stik* (state) of transition. This is called
*udayābhāvi* *kṣaya* (non-arising decay) in *prakṛti*. Here, the non-arising
from the nature itself is intended as decay. And these *sarvaghati* *spardhaka*s
and *prakṛti*s, which are capable of arising in the future, remain in the form
of *upasama* (subdued) in their *sadavastha* (true state). This means that they
exist in reality. The *udayavali* (arising series) does not cause the *udīraṇa*
(excitation) of those *niṣeka*s (restrictions) above. Only through the
transition in the *stik* in the *udayavali*, their transition takes place before
the time of their arising in the form of *sa-jātiya* (same-kind) *deśaghati*
(country-destroying) *prakṛti* or *spardhaka*. The meaning of this is that the
*jīva*’s own nature comes to light due to the non-arising and non-excitation of
the *sarvaghati* *aṁśa* (all-destructive part), and the *deśaghati* *aṁśa*
(country-destroying part) brings about *sadōṣata* (imperfection) in it due to
its arising. 264. Now, to explain the distinctions of the twenty-one types of
*audayika* states that have been mentioned, the next sutra is uttered. There are
twenty-one types of *audayika* states: four *gati*s, four *kṣaya*s, three
*linga*s, one *mithyādarśana*, one *ajñāna*, one *asanyama*, one *asiddha*
state, and six *leśyā*s. ||6|| 8265. The word 'yathākramam' (in order) is
understood in this sutra, because it is relevant here. There are four types of
*gati*: *narakagati* (hellish path), *tiryag* *gati* (animal path), *manuṣya*
*gati* (human path), and *devagati* (divine path). Among these, *narakagati* is
*audayika* because it arises from the *karma* called *nāmakarma* (name-karma)
which leads to the state of hell. Similarly, the meaning of the other three
*gati*s should be understood. There are four types of *kṣaya*: *krodha* (anger),
*māna* (pride), *māyā* (deceit), and *lobha* (greed). Among these, *krodha* is
*audayika* because it arises from the *karma* that produces anger. Similarly,
the other three *kṣaya*s should be understood as *audayika*. There are three
types of *linga*:

## Chapter Two  [115] There are six types of *leshyas*: *krishna-leshya*, *nila-
leshya*, *kapota-leshya*, *tejo-leshya*, *padma-leshya*, and *shukla-leshya*.
[8266] It is said in the scriptures that *shukla-leshya* exists in the
*upashanta-kashya*, *kshina-kashya*, and *sayoga-kevali* stages. But in these
stages, there is no arising of *kashyas*, so how can there be *audayika*
(arising from *karma*) *leshyas*? This is not a fault. Because of the *purva-
bhava-prajnapan* *naya* (principle of knowing the previous state), the *leshyas*
in the *upashanta-kashya* etc. stages are considered *audayika* because they are
influenced by the arising of *kashyas* in the previous stages. Since there is no
arising of *kashyas* in the *ayoga-kevali* stage, it is certain that they are
*leshya-rahita* (without *leshyas*).  [8267] The *parinamika* (resulting from
*karma*) state has three divisions. To explain the nature of these divisions,
the next sutra says:  "There are three divisions of the *parinamika* state:
*jivattva*, *bhavya*, and *abhavya*." [7]  [8268] *Jivattva*, *bhavya*, and
*abhavya* are three *parinamika* states that do not exist in other substances.
Therefore, they should be understood as belonging to the soul.   Question: Why
are these *parinamika*?  Answer: These three states are dependent on the
arising, subsidence, destruction, and destruction-subsidence of *karma*.
Therefore, they are *parinamika*.  *Jivattva* is dependent on: 1. *Pana-peksha*
(the principle of knowing the previous state), 2. *Di. 1* (the first *dravya* -
soul), and 3. *Di. 2* (the second *dravya* - *karma*).

## 116] Sarvarthasiddhi  [217 8 268] There are three Pariṇāmika
(transformational) states of the Jiva (soul). [8 269]  It may be argued that
states like Astitva (existence), Nityatva (eternality), and Pradeshavatva
(having a spatial dimension) are also Pariṇāmika, and should be included here.
This is not necessary, as they are already included. How? Because the word "cha"
(and) in the sutra indicates their inclusion.  If this is the case, then the
number "three" becomes contradictory, as there would be more than three
Pariṇāmika states. This is not a contradiction, as there are only three
*specific* Pariṇāmika states of the Jiva. Astitva, etc., are *general* states,
applicable to both Jiva and Ajiva (non-soul), and are therefore separately
included by the word "cha".   It may be argued that states like Aupashmika
(secondary) cannot exist, as the Atman (soul) is amurta (formless). These states
are dependent on Karma-bandha (bondage of karma), and an amurta Atman cannot be
bound by karma. This is not correct, due to the principle of Anekanta (non-
absolutism). It is not absolute that the Atman is only amurta. Due to the
influence of Karma-bandha, it can be considered murta (formful) in a relative
sense, and amurta in its pure form.   If this is the case, then the Atman's
unity due to the influence of Karma-bandha would lead to the absence of
distinction. This is not a flaw, as even though there is unity in terms of
bondage, the distinction between the Atman and Karma is recognized due to the
difference in their characteristics. As it is said:  "Bandham padi eyattam
lakkhanado havi tassa naanattam. Tamha amuttibhavo yanto hoi jivassa."  This
means: "Even though the Atman is one in terms of bondage, it is different in
terms of its characteristics. Therefore, the amurta state of the Jiva is
Anekanta, existing in one sense and not in another."  **Explanation:**  There
are three Pariṇāmika states: Jivatva (being a soul), Bhavyatva (being capable of
liberation), and Abhavyatva (being incapable of liberation).   Jivatva has two
aspects: one related to the life-process, and the other related to the quality
of Chaitanya (consciousness). The life-process is dependent on Pranas (vital
energies), and therefore this aspect of Jivatva is not primary. The primary
aspect is the Chaitanya-related Jivatva, which is present in all Jivas equally
and is independent of any cause. This is why it is called Pariṇāmika.   The same
understanding applies to Bhavyatva and Abhavyatva, as both are also independent
of any cause. Generally, those who have the potential to manifest the three
jewels (Samyak Darshan, Samyak Jnana, and Samyak Charitra) are considered
Bhavyas.

## Chapter Two  8270. If this is so, then let the characteristic be stated by
which the difference is established. To this, it is said: **Usage is the
characteristic.** || 8 || -219 § 273] 8271. Usage is a consequence that arises
from both internal and external causes and is an attribute of consciousness.
Thus, even though the soul is one in terms of bondage, it is recognized as
distinct due to usage. Just as gold and silver are one in terms of bondage, but
are different due to their color and other characteristics, so it should be
understood in this case. $ 272 To demonstrate this difference, it is said: [117
**Usage is of two kinds, eight and four.** || 9 || 8273. That usage is of two
kinds: **knowledge-usage** and **perception-usage**. **Knowledge-usage** is of
eight kinds: **mati-jnana**, **shruta-jnana**, **avadhi-jnana**, **manas-
paryaya-jnana**, **kevala-jnana**, **mati-ajnana**, **shruta-ajnana**,
**vibhang-jnana**. **Perception-usage** is of four kinds: **chakshu-darshan**,
**achakshu-darshan**, **avadhi-darshan**, **kevala-darshan**. How is the
difference between them?

## 118] **On the attainment of all purposes** [219 § 273 Due to the difference
between the concrete and the abstract. Concrete is knowledge, abstract is
perception. These exist in succession in those who have veils. In those who are
without veils, they exist simultaneously, even though perception precedes
knowledge, because of its superiority. Before the chapter on right knowledge,
five types of knowledge-use were explained. Here, due to the acceptance of use,
the opposite is also accepted, hence it is said to be eight-fold. 274. With the
outcome described above, the use that is common to all souls, the beings who are
marked by that use are of two types - worldly and liberated || 10 And the
knowledge of differentiation. There are four types of perception-use - visual
perception, non-visual perception, clairvoyance, and omniscience. Doubt - What
is the reason for the difference between these two uses? Solution - The
difference between these two uses is due to the difference between the concrete
and the abstract. Concrete is knowledge-use and abstract is perception-use.
These two exist in succession in those who have veils and simultaneously in
those who are without veils. Although perception comes first, knowledge is
placed before perception in the sutra because of its superiority. Due to the
chapter on right knowledge, five types of knowledge-use were explained earlier.
But here, due to the acceptance of use, the opposite is also accepted, hence it
is said to be eight-fold. Special meaning - Here, the characteristic of the
being is explained as use, and its divisions are enumerated. The main divisions
of use are two - knowledge-use and perception-use. Both types of use are found
in all beings. There are many sub-divisions of these, which arise due to
specific causes. The sub-divisions of knowledge-veil and perception-veil, their
respective destruction and cessation, destruction, and the arising of
perception-delusion, these are the main causes. Due to these, both types of use
are divided into twelve divisions. In this way, eight divisions of knowledge-use
and four divisions of perception-use are obtained. Mainly, a worldly being has
one use at a time, and a liberated being has two uses. But when considering
various beings, they are twelve. Although in the first chapter, four types of
knowledge were mentioned for one being at a time, and for one who has four types
of knowledge at the same time, three types of perception will also be found at
that time, but this statement should be understood as being based on the
predominance of destruction and cessation. In one being at a time, the
destruction and cessation of four knowledge-veils like knowledge-veil, etc., and
three perception-veils like visual perception-veil, etc., these seven karmas can
occur, but in reality, their use at that time will be only one. Destruction and
cessation are the cause of the arising of knowledge and perception, and use is
the tendency of knowledge and perception. In a being, the stream of knowledge
and perception qualities is constantly flowing. At the time when it receives an
external or internal cause, it starts working accordingly. It is certain that in
the worldly state, it remains impure, more impure, and most impure, and upon
attaining liberation, it becomes pure, then external and internal causes are not
required for its tendency." This is the reason why the characteristic of the
being is called use here. 8 274. The beings who are marked by all uses, which
are indicated by the outcome of the soul-transformation that was explained
earlier, which is common to all souls, are of two types, this is what the next
sutra says -  There are two types of beings - worldly and liberated ||  1. विष

## Chapter Two  [119]  8275. Samsarana is called Samsara, which means
transformation. This is present in all beings who are Samsarin. This
transformation is of five types: Dravya Parivartan, Kshetra Parivartan, Kala
Parivartan, Bhav Parivartan, and Bhav Parivartan. Of these, Dravya Parivartan is
of two types: Nokarma Dravya Parivartan and Karma Dravya Parivartan.   Nokarma
Dravya Parivartan is defined as follows: A single Jiva, at a particular time,
takes in Pudgalas suitable for the three bodies and six Paryaptis. These
Pudgalas, depending on their Snigdha, Rooksha, Varna, Gandha, etc., and their
Tivra, Mand, and Madhyama Bhav, remain in their respective states and are then
discarded in the subsequent times. After this, the Jiva takes in and discards
the Agrihit Pudgalas for an infinite number of times, then the Mishra Pudgalas
for an infinite number of times, and finally the Hit Pudgalas for an infinite
number of times. Then, the same Pudgalas, in the same way, become the Nokarma
Bhav of the same Jiva. This entire process is called Nokarma Dravya Parivartan.
Karma Dravya Parivartan is defined as follows: A single Jiva, at a particular
time, takes in Pudgalas through the eight types of Karma Bhav. These Pudgalas
are discarded after one Avali, in the subsequent times. Then, following the same
process as described for Nokarma Dravya Parivartan, these same Pudgalas, in the
same way, become the Karma Bhav of the same Jiva. This entire process is called
Karma Dravya Parivartan. It is said:  "All Pudgalas are consumed and discarded
by the Jiva. And thus, the Jiva keeps revolving in the Samsara of Pudgala
Parivartan."  8276. Kshetra Parivartan is defined as follows: A very subtle
Nigoda Jiva, with insufficient Paryapti, having a body in the lowest region of
space, is born in the eighth Madhya Pradesh of the Lok, taking the Madhya
Pradesh of his body as his own. He lives for the duration of a Ksudra Bhav and
then dies. Then, the same Jiva is born again in the same place, then a third
time, then a fourth time, and so on, until he has been born in all the regions
of space that are as large as an immeasurable fraction of an Angula.

[120] Sarvarthasiddhi [2110 8 278] There, after being born, the entire universe
is brought to the state of being the birth-field of the self, by increasing the
extent of each region, until there is a change of field. It is said: _"There is
no region in the entire universe where this being has not been born, repeatedly,
with the intention of liberation. Thus, this being has wandered many times in
the field of the universe."_ 8277. The change of time is called: A being born in
the first time of the Utsarpini, dies at the end of his lifespan. The same being
is born again in the second time of the Utsarpini, and dies at the end of his
lifespan. The same being is born again in the third time of the Utsarpini. In
this way, the Utsarpini is completed. Similarly, the Avasarpini. Thus, the
continuity of birth is stated. The continuity of death is also to be understood
in the same way. This is the change of time. It is said: _"In the times of the
Utsarpini and Avasarpini, without any exception, this being has been born and
died many times, wandering in the time-universe."_ 8278. The change of existence
is called: In the hell-realm, the most inferior lifespan is ten thousand years.
A being born there with that lifespan, after wandering, is born again with the
same lifespan. Thus, for as many times as there are ten thousand years, he is
born and dies. Then, increasing the lifespan by one time each, he completes
thirty-three oceans of lifespan. Then, he is born in the animal realm with a
lifespan of an antarmukhurta. In the same way, he completes three palya-upamas
of lifespan in the animal realm. He is born in the human realm with a lifespan
of an antarmukhurta. In the same way, he completes three palya-upamas of
lifespan in the human realm. And in the heaven realm, he completes a lifespan
equal to that of the hell realm. But the heaven 1. Ba. A., A., Ga. 26. 2. Haneṇa

## Chapter Two  [121]  And in the human realm, as well as in the realm of the
gods, there are hellish states. However, there is a difference:  A being
undergoes a **bhavacarita** (cycle of births and deaths) for as long as thirty
oceans worth of lifetimes.  As it is said:  "From the lowest hell to the highest
heaven, the being wanders repeatedly, Driven by the delusion of the senses, it
experiences many births and deaths."  6279. Now, we speak of **bhavacarita**: A
being with five senses, a **paryāptaka** (sufficient) and **mithyātvā** (false
belief), attains the most wretched state, the **antaḥkoṭikoṭi** (innermost)
state, according to its **jñānāvaraṇa** (veil of knowledge) nature.  For this
being, there are countless **kṣayā** (passions) **adhyavasāya** (determinations)
states, as many as the number of worlds, which are **ṣaṭsthāna** (six-fold)
fallen and suitable for its state.  From these most wretched **kṣayā**
**adhyavasāya** states, there arise countless **anubhāga** (experiences)
**adhyavasāya** states, as many as the number of worlds.  Thus, the being,
dwelling in the most wretched state, with the most wretched **kṣayā**
**adhyavasāya** state, and the most wretched **anubhāga** **adhyavasāya** state,
attains the most wretched **yoga** (state of being) state, suitable for it.  For
these states of **kṣayā** and **anubhāga**, there is a second **yoga** state,
with an increase of countless parts.  And so, in the third, fourth, and
subsequent states, there are **yoga** states, as many as the countless parts of
a **śreṇi** (series).  Then, for the being that maintains the same state and the
same **kṣayā** **adhyavasāya** state, there is a second **anubhāga**
**adhyavasāya** state.  Its **yoga** states should be understood as before.
Similarly, in the third, fourth, and subsequent states, there is this much
difference:  Here, one should speak of thirty-one oceans worth of lifetimes.
Thus, all this together constitutes a **bhavacarita**.  As it is said:  "In this
life, due to the contact with **mithyātvā**, the being is born in the lowest
hell, and in the highest heaven, and wanders repeatedly in the wretched states."
6279. Now, we speak of **bhavacarita**: A being with five senses, a
**paryāptaka** (sufficient) and **mithyātvā** (false belief), attains the most
wretched state, the **antaḥkoṭikoṭi** (innermost) state, according to its
**jñānāvaraṇa** (veil of knowledge) nature.  For this being, there are countless
**kṣayā** (passions) **adhyavasāya** (determinations) states, as many as the
number of worlds, which are **ṣaṭsthāna** (six-fold) fallen and suitable for its
state.  And from these most wretched **kṣayā** **adhyavasāya** states, there
arise countless **anubhāga** (experiences) **adhyavasāya** states, as many as
the number of worlds.  Thus, the being, dwelling in the most wretched state,
with the most wretched **kṣayā** **adhyavasāya** state, and the most wretched
**anubhāga** **adhyavasāya** state, attains the most wretched **yoga** (state of
being) state, suitable for it.  Then, the state, the **kṣayā** **adhyavasāya**
state, and the **anubhāga** **adhyavasāya** state remain the same, but the
**yoga** state becomes different, with an increase of countless parts.
Similarly, in the third, fourth, and subsequent **yoga** states, one should
understand.  These **yoga** states are all **catur-sthāna** (four-fold) fallen,
and their number is as many as the countless parts of a **śreṇi** (series).
Then, for the being that maintains the same state and the same **kṣayā**
**adhyavasāya** state, there is a second **anubhāga** **adhyavasāya** state.
Its **yoga** states should be understood as before.  The meaning is that here
too, the aforementioned three things remain constant, but the **yoga** states
are as many as the countless parts of a **jag-śreṇi** (world-series).  Thus, in
the third, fourth, and subsequent **anubhāga** **adhyavasāya** states, one
should understand until there are countless **anubhāga** **adhyavasāya** states,
as many as the number of worlds.  The meaning is that here, the state and the
**kṣayā** **adhyavasāya** state remain wretched, but the **anubhāga**
**adhyavasāya** states gradually become countless, as many as the number of
worlds, and for each **anubhāga** **adhyavasāya** state, there are **yoga**
states as many as the countless parts of a **jag-śreṇi** (world-series).  Then,
for the being that attains the same state, there is a second **kṣayā**
**adhyavasāya** state.  Its **anubhāga** **adhyavasāya** states and **yoga**
states should be understood as before.  That is:  1.  And like the animal realm.
(Mū., Tā.) 2.  (Bā., A., Gā.) 28 1 3.  **Anubhāga** **adhyavasāya** (Di.) 4.  In
the third, fourth, and subsequent **yoga** states.  (Mū., Tā.)

[122] Sarvarthasiddhi [2110 8 279~In the Anubhaga Adhyavasaya Sthanas, there are
countless Lokas, and in each Anubhaga Adhyavasaya Sthan, there are countless
Yogasthans, as per the Jagashreni. In this way, the increase in the number of
Kshaya Adhyavasaya Sthanas should be understood in the third and subsequent
Kshaya Adhyavasaya Sthanas. Just as the lowest Kshaya Adhyavasaya Sthanas have
been described, so too should the Kshaya Adhyavasaya Sthanas of a higher time
period be understood. And in this way, with each increase in time, the Kshaya
Adhyavasaya Sthanas of the highest state, which is as vast as thirty Koti Koti
Sagaras, should be understood. Ananta Bhaga Vridhi, Asankhya Bhaga Vridhi,
Sankhya Bhaga Vridhi, Sankhya Guna Vridhi, Asankhya Guna Vridhi, and Ananta Guna
Vridhi - these are the six stages of increase. Similarly, there are six types of
decrease. When Ananta Bhaga Vridhi and Ananta Guna Vridhi are removed, there are
four stages remaining. In this way, the transformation of all the Mula Prakrutis
and their Uttar Prakrutis should be understood. All this together is called
Bhava Parivartan. It is said: 3'All beings, due to their association with
Mithyatva, have attained the Sthanas of Prakruti, Sthiti, Anubhaga, and
Pradeshbandha, and wander in the Bhava Samsara.' 8 280. Those who have renounced
the five types of Samsara mentioned above are liberated. The term 'Samsari' is
used first in the Sutra because the term 'Mukta' is attained after Samsara.
Special Note: There are two main categories of Jivas - Samsari and Mukta. These
categories are based on the bound and unbound states of the Jiva. In reality,
these are two states of the Jiva. Initially, the Jiva is in the bound state,
hence it is called Samsari. Later, when it becomes liberated, it is called
Mukta. The Samsara of the Jiva is relative to the cause, therefore, five
categories of Samsara are described based on this relativity - Dravya Samsara,
Kshetra Samsara, Kala Samsara, Bhava Samsara, and Bhava Samsara. Their other
name is Parivartan. The term Dravya refers to Karma and Anokarma, Kshetra refers
to the regions of Lokakasha, Kala refers to the time related to Utsarpini and
Avasarpini, Bhava refers to the states of the Jiva like Naraka, etc., and Bhava
refers to the Yogas of the Jiva. 1. As before, one Sama-Mu. 2. -Sthanani (as
before) Vedi-Mu. 3. Ba. Anu. Ga. 29.

## Chapter Two  [123 -2112 5 284]  $281.$ The beings who are in the cycle of
birth and death are of two types: Those with mind and those without mind. ||11||
$282.$ Mind is of two types: Dravya-mana and Bhava-mana. Dravya-mana is that
which arises due to the ripening of the karma called Pudgala-vipaki, Anga-
upanga, and Nama-karma. Bhava-mana is the purification of the soul, which is
dependent on the destruction and cessation of the karma called Virya-antaraya,
No-indriya-avaran. Those who possess this mind are called Samanaskas. Those who
do not possess this mind are called Amanaskas. Thus, beings in the cycle of
birth and death are divided into two categories based on the presence or absence
of mind: Samanaskas and Amanaskas. The word Samanaskas comes first in the
compound word "Samanaskamanaskas" because it is more significant. Why is it more
significant? Because Samanaskas are those who contemplate on virtues and vices.
$283.$ To further explain the different categories of beings in the cycle of
birth and death, the next sutra states: Beings in the cycle of birth and death
are of two types: Trasas and Sthavaras. ||12||  $284.$ Question: The use of the
word "Samsari" (being in the cycle of birth and death) in the sutra is
redundant, as it is already established in the context. Counter-question: Where
is it established in the context? Answer: It is established in the sutra
"Samsarinah Muktascha" (Beings in the cycle of birth and death and those who are
liberated). Solution: The use of the word "Samsari" in the sutra is not
redundant, as it refers back to the previous sutra. The meaning is that the
Samanaskas and Amanaskas mentioned in the previous sutra are beings in the cycle
of birth and death. If the word "Samsari" is not considered as a qualifier of
the previous sutra, then the words Samanaskas and Amanaskas would be associated
with the liberated souls, which is not the case.  And the Kasaya-sthana (the
place of passions) is intended here. This explains how the soul keeps wandering
in the cycle of birth and death due to these Dravya (matter) and other causes.
These transformations take progressively longer and longer. The soul's cycle of
birth and death is primarily considered to be until the attainment of Samyag-
darshan (right faith). This proves that these transformations occur while the
soul is in the state of Mithyatva (false belief). Once Samyag-darshan is
attained, even if the soul remains in the cycle of birth and death for a short
time, it is freed from these transformations. Complete liberation occurs in the
state of Mukti (liberation). This is why the soul is categorized into two types:
Samsari (being in the cycle of birth and death) and Mukta (liberated).  $281.$
The beings in the cycle of birth and death mentioned earlier are of two types.
The next sutra explains this: There are beings in the cycle of birth and death
who have mind and those who do not have mind. ||11||  $282.$ Mind is of two
types: Dravya-mana and Bhava-mana. Dravya-mana is that which arises due to the
ripening of the karma called Pudgala-vipaki, Anga-upanga, and Nama-karma. Bhava-
mana is the purification of the soul, which is dependent on the destruction and
cessation of the karma called Virya-antaraya, No-indriya-avaran. Those who
possess this mind are called Samanaskas. Those who do not possess this mind are
called Amanaskas. Thus, beings in the cycle of birth and death are divided into
two categories based on the presence or absence of mind: Samanaskas and
Amanaskas. The word Samanaskas comes first in the compound word
"Samanaskamanaskas" because it is more significant. Why is it more significant?
Because Samanaskas are those who contemplate on virtues and vices.  $283.$ Now,
to further explain the different categories of beings in the cycle of birth and
death, the next sutra states: Beings in the cycle of birth and death are of two
types: Trasas and Sthavaras. ||12||  $284.$ Question: The use of the word
"Samsari" (being in the cycle of birth and death) in the sutra is redundant, as
it is already established in the context. Counter-question: Where is it
established in the context? Answer: It is established in the sutra "Samsarinah

Solution: The use of the word "Samsari" in the sutra is not redundant, as it
refers back to the previous sutra. The meaning is that the Samanaskas and
Amanaskas mentioned in the previous sutra are beings in the cycle of birth and
death. If the word "Samsari" is not considered as a qualifier of the previous
sutra, then the words Samanaskas and Amanaskas would be associated with the
liberated souls, which is not the case.

124) Sarvarthasiddhi -2112 6 284] And by doing this, the inclusion of 'samsari'
at the beginning becomes appropriate. It also serves the purpose of a good
answer in relation to the previous sutra. Those samsaris are of two types -
trasas and sthavaras. Those who have the rise of the trasanama karma are trasas.
Those who have the rise of the sthavaranāma karma are sthavaras. If it is said
that 'trasyaanti' means those who move are trasas and those who are stationary
are sthavaras, then this is not correct, because it contradicts the Agama. In
the Agama, it is stated that from the two-sense beings to the Aayogakevali, all
beings are trasas, based on the transformation of the body. Therefore, the
distinction between trasas and sthavaras is not based on movement or non-
movement, but on the rise of karma. The word 'trasas' is included at the
beginning because it has fewer letters than 'sthavaras' and is superior. It is
superior because it is possible to find all its uses. 8 285. Since there is much
to be said about the one-sense beings, the next sutra is stated to give
knowledge of the types of sthavaras, leaving aside the order of the sutras.
Earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied, air-bodied, and plant-bodied, these are
the five sthavaras. ||13|| 8 286. Earth-bodied etc. are the types of
sthavaranāma karma. Due to their rise, the beings should be known by the names
earth etc. Although these names are derived from the roots 'prathan' etc., they
are conventional, therefore, there is no expectation of the qualities of
'prathan' etc. in them. The question arises: In the Aarsh, these earth etc. are
said to be of four different types, how are these four types obtained? The
answer is: Earth, earth-bodied, earth-bodied, and earth-being, these are the
four types of earth. Of these, the one which is inanimate, formed by natural
transformations, and has the quality of hardness is earth. Although it is
inanimate, it is still considered to have the rise of the earth-nama karma
because it is recognized by the action of 'prathan'. 1. It becomes. Samsa-Mu. 2.

## Chapter Two  [125]  In all three categories of existence, there is the
concept of a body. The body is called *pṛthvīkāya* when it is abandoned by a
*pṛthvīkāyika* jīva. This *pṛthvīkāya* is like the body of a dead human. A
*pṛthvīkāyika* is one who possesses a *pṛthvīkāya*. The soul is bound to this
body. A *pṛthvījīva* is one who does not yet possess a *pṛthvīkāya* as a body,
as the karma that would give rise to such a body has not yet matured. The same
logic applies to the other categories of existence. These five types of beings
are stationary.  **Question:** How many *prāṇas* do they have?  **Answer:** They
have four *prāṇas*: *sparśaindriyaprāṇa*, *kāyabalaprāṇa*, *ucchvāsa-niḥśvāsa-
prāṇa*, and *āyuḥprāṇa*.  8287. Now, to understand who the *trasas* are, the
next sūtra states:  **Two-sense beings, etc., are *trasas*.** [14]  8288. A
being with two senses is called a *dvīndriya*. The term "etc." indicates a
sequence.  **Question:** Where is this sequence explained?  **Answer:** In the
scriptures.  **Question:** What is the order?  **Answer:** Two-sense, three-
sense, four-sense, and five-sense beings. The term
*tadguṇasaviṣṇānavṛttigrahaṇa* implies that two-sense beings are also included.
**Question:** How many *prāṇas* do these beings have?  **Answer:** Two-sense
beings have six *prāṇas*, the four mentioned earlier plus *rasanavākaprāṇa*.
Three-sense beings have seven *prāṇas*, the six mentioned earlier plus
*ghrāṇaprāṇa*. Four-sense beings have eight *prāṇas*, the seven mentioned
earlier plus *cakṣuḥprāṇa*. Five-sense beings, if they are *tiryañc* and
*asaṁjñī*, have nine *prāṇas*, the eight mentioned earlier plus *śrotraprāṇa*.
If they are *saṁjñī*, they have ten *prāṇas*, the nine mentioned earlier plus
*manobala*.  1. *Jīva*. It is said: "Earth, *pṛthvīkāya*, *pṛthvīkāyika*,
*pṛthvījīva*. The body is taken from the general category and is then
abandoned." - *Eva-mu*.  2. "The *bahuvrīhi* compound *tadguṇasaviṣṇānavṛtti*."
- *Pari.-śe. p. 4, 4*.  3. *Balādhikāḥ*, *Ā.*., *Di. 1, Di. 21*.

## 126] Sarvathasidau  [21158289$ 289. The next Sutra explains that the number
of Indriyas (sense organs) indicated by the word 'Adi' (beginning) needs to be
determined. Five Indriyas (sense organs) are there. ||15|| 8290: The word
'Indriya' has been explained. The word 'Panch' (five) is used to define the
number, meaning there are only five and not more. Should the Karmendriyas
(organs of action) like hands, feet, etc. be included here? No, they should not
be included, because this is a context of use. Here, the organs that are
instrumental in use are included, not the organs that are instrumental in
action. Also, there is no limit to the organs that are instrumental in action.
All the organs and their parts, which are created by the Karma (action) of the
body, are instrumental in action. Therefore, there are only five Karmendriyas. 6
291. To show the internal differences of these five Indriyas, the next Sutra
says: They are of two types. ||16|| 8 292. The word 'Vidh' means type.
'Dvividhani' is a Bahuvrihi compound meaning 'those which are of two types'.
Here, it is explained that there are six Pranas (life forces) in the Dvi-Indriya
(two-sense organ) state, seven in the Tri-Indriya (three-sense organ) state,
eight in the Chatur-Indriya (four-sense organ) state, nine in the Asanjee (non-
conscious) Panch-Indriya (five-sense organ) state, and ten in the Sanjee
(conscious) Panch-Indriya state. In the Aapt (deficient) state, there are four,
five, six, and seven Pranas respectively. The explanation is as follows: There
are ten Pranas in total - five Indriya Pranas (sense organ life forces), three
Bal Pranas (strength life forces) - Aayu (life force) and Shwaso-chchwas
(breathing). In the Aapt (deficient) state of Sanjee and Asanjee, the three
Pranas - Shwaso-chchwas, Manobal (mental strength), and Vachanbal (speech
strength) are not present, leaving seven Pranas. In the Aapt (deficient) state
of Chatur-Indriya, the three Pranas mentioned above and Shrotrendriya (hearing
sense organ) are not present, leaving six Pranas. In the Aapt (deficient) state
of Tri-Indriya, the four Pranas mentioned above and Chakshu-Indriya (sight sense
organ) are not present, leaving five Pranas. In the Aapt (deficient) state of
Dvi-Indriya, the five Pranas mentioned above and Ghranendriya (smell sense
organ) are not present, leaving four Pranas. In the Aapt (deficient) state of
Eka-Indriya (one-sense organ), the six Pranas mentioned above and Shwaso-chchwas
are not present, leaving three Pranas. 8289. The word 'Adi' used in the previous
Sutra does not reveal the number of Indriyas. Therefore, the next Sutra explains
to determine their quantity. There are five Indriyas. ||15|| 8290. The word
'Indriya' has been explained. The word 'Panch' used in the Sutra is to define
the limit, meaning there are only five Indriyas. This means there are no more
Indriyas. Doubt: Should the Karmendriyas like speech, etc. be included in this
Sutra? Solution: They should not be included, because this is a context of use.
This Sutra includes the Indriyas that are instrumental in use, not the Indriyas
that are instrumental in action. Secondly, there is no limit to the Indriyas
that are instrumental in action. All the organs and their parts, which are
created by the Karma (action) of the body, are instrumental in action.
Therefore, there is no rule that there are only five Karmendriyas. 8291. Now, to
show the internal differences of these five Indriyas, the next Sutra says - They
are each of two types. ||16|| $ 292. The word 'Vidh' means type. 'Dvividhani' is
a Bahuvrihi compound meaning 'those which are of two types'. This means that
each of these five Indriyas is of two types. 1. 'Vak-Panipada-Payu-Upasthani

## Chapter Two  [296] **What are the two types?**  The answer is:
**Dravyendriya** and **Bhaavendriya**.  [293] To understand the nature of
Dravyendriya, the following sutra is stated:  **Dravyendriya is the instrument
of Nivritti.** [17]  [294] **Nivritti** is the creation. **What creates it?**
The answer is: **Karma**. Karma is of two types: **Baahya Nivritti** (external
creation) and **Aabhyantara Nivritti** (internal creation).  **Aabhyantara
Nivritti** is the creation of pure Atma-pradeshas (regions of the soul) which
are as numerous as the parts of an Utsadha-anguli (a measure of length), and are
situated in a fixed arrangement of the senses like eyes, etc.  **Baahya
Nivritti** is the accumulation of Pudgalas (matter particles) in those Atma-
pradeshas, which are designated as senses, and which acquire a specific state
due to the rise of **Naama Karma** (karma that determines the name and form).
**Upakaran** (instrument) is that which facilitates Nivritti. Like Nivritti, it
is also of two types: **Aabhyantara** (internal) and **Baahya** (external).  In
the case of the eye, the **Krishna-Shukla Mandala** (black and white circles) is
the **Aabhyantara Upakaran**, while the eyelids and eyelashes are the **Baahya
Upakaran**. The same principle applies to other senses.  [295] The following
sutra describes Bhaavendriya:  **Bhaavendriya is the instrument of Labdhi and
Upayoga.** [18]  [296] **Labdhi** means "to obtain". **What is Labdhi?** The
answer is: **Labdhi** is the specific cessation of **Jnaanaavaran Karma** (karma
that obscures knowledge).  **Upayoga** is the transformation of the soul that
occurs due to the proximity of **Labdhi**, which enables the soul to engage in
**Dravyendriya Nivritti**.

## 128] **Sarvarthasiddhi**  [21188 296 Indriyam. Indriyaphala is upayoga, how
can it be Indriyam? Because the dharma of the cause is seen in the effect. Just
like the knowledge that has become the form of a pot is called a pot. And
because the self-interest is the main thing there. The self-interest that the
linga of Indra is Indriyam is the main thing in upayoga, because there is the
statement "Upayogalakshano Jeeva". Therefore, it is justified to consider
upayoga as Indriyam. The soul, due to contact, strives to create dravyendriya,
the result of the soul for that is called upayoga. Labdhi and upayoga, both are
bhaavendriyas. Doubt - Upayoga is the fruit of Indriyam, how can it be Indriyam?
Solution - The dharma of the cause is seen in the effect. Just like the
knowledge that has become the form of a pot is called a pot. Therefore, there is
no objection in considering the fruit of Indriyam as Indriyam. Secondly, the
meaning of Indriyam is mainly found in upayoga. The meaning is that "the linga
of Indra is called Indriyam", this meaning of the word Indriyam is the main
thing in upayoga, because the characteristic of the Jeeva is upayoga, such is
the statement, therefore, it is appropriate to consider upayoga as Indriyam.
**J**  **Vishesharth** - Not allowing the specific synonyms of knowledge to
manifest is the work of the rise of the all-destroying competitors of the
desired knowledge-obstruction. But the Jeeva whose desired knowledge-obstruction
is destroyed, due to the non-rise of the all-destroying competitors of that
knowledge-obstruction, has the ability to come into the light of the desired
knowledge, and this ability is called Labdhi. Such ability can be of all the
knowledge that destroys the obstruction at the same time, but in upayoga, only
one knowledge comes at one time. The meaning is that the synonym that has come
in front of knowing the knowledge that destroys the obstruction is not called
Labdhi, but the name of the specific destruction of the obstruction is Labdhi,
and upayoga is the name of the appropriate synonym of knowledge. This is the
reason why Labdhi can be of many knowledge at the same time, but upayoga is of
only one knowledge at one time. Earlier, in the first chapter, sutra 14, it has
been said that Mati-gyan happens due to Indriyam and mind. From this, it is
known that the Indriyam designation is not of the knowledge of the form of
upayoga, but the Indriyam designation is of the one which is the most effective
cause in the happening of Mati-gyan and Shruta-gyan in the form of upayoga,
therefore, it is right to call Nirvritti, Upkaran and Labdhi as Indriyam,
because these are the most effective causes in the happening of Mati-gyan and
Shruta-gyan in the form of upayoga, but it is not right to call upayoga itself
as Indriyam, because it is the fruit of Indriyam vyapar. This is a doubt, the
solution of which has been given by Pujyapad Swami in two ways. Firstly, it has
been told that the dharma of the cause, Indriyatva, has been treated in the
effect, and upayoga has also been called Indriyam. That is, upayoga itself is
not Indriyam, but it happens due to Indriyam, therefore, it has been called
Indriyam here by treatment. This is the first solution. While giving the second
solution, the meaning of what he has written is that whatever makes Indra, that
is, the soul, recognizable, is called Indriyam, and such a thing that makes it
recognizable should be its own meaning. If it is seen from this point of view,
then the main word of Indriyam is upayoga, because it is the own meaning of the
soul. This is the reason why upayoga has also been called Indriyam here. The
meaning is that considering the expectation of the cause, Nirvritti, Upkaran and
Labdhi get the designation of Indriyam, and considering the expectation of self-
interest, upayoga gets the designation of Indriyam. In the first chapter, only
the expectation of the cause was used for the word Indriyam, and here, the
difference of Indriyam has been shown by keeping both the cause and the main
meaning in mind, therefore, there is no contradiction. 1. -Yogo Mukhya: Di. 1,

[129 -2120 300] Chapter Two $ 297. To explain the meaning of the senses
mentioned above, the following sutra is stated: Sparśana, rasana, ghraṇa, cakṣu,
and śrotra are the five senses. ||19|| 8298. In the world, the senses are seen
to be dependent. For example, "I see well with this eye," "I hear well with this
ear." Therefore, due to their dependence, sparśana etc. become instruments. Due
to the destruction of the obstacles of effort, knowledge, and the covering of
the mind, and due to the cessation of the actions of the limbs, the soul touches
through this, therefore it is sparśana. It tastes through this, therefore it is
rasana. It smells through this, therefore it is ghraṇa. Since the word cakṣu has
many meanings, here the meaning of seeing is taken, therefore it is cakṣu,
through which one sees objects. And it is śrotra, through which one hears.
Similarly, the independence of these senses is also seen. For example, "This eye
of mine sees well," "This ear of mine hears well." Therefore, sparśana etc. are
established as agents. That which touches is sparśana. That which tastes is
rasana. That which smells is ghraṇa. That which sees is cakṣu. That which hears
is śrotra. The order in which these are mentioned is to show that each one
increases in this order. 8 299. To show the objects of these senses, the
following sutra is stated: Sparśa, rasa, gandha, varṇa, and śabda are the
objects of those senses respectively. ||20|| 6 300. In the context of the
predominance of substance and its modification, the words sparśa etc. should be
understood as instruments of action and instruments of feeling. When the
substance is predominant, then the action is indicated. For example, that which
is touched is sparśa, that which is tasted is rasa, that which is smelled is
gandha, that which is seen is varṇa, and that which is in the form of sound is
śabda. This 1.  Jighratyanena ghraṇam gandham gṛhṇātīti. Rasayatyaneṇeniti

130] Sarvarthasiddhi [2121 $ 301 The word "varna" is derived from "varnya" (to
be described). The word "shabda" is derived from "shabdana" (to sound). When the
emphasis is on the meaning of the synonym, then the meaning of the word is
indicated. For example, "spardhana" is "sparsha" (touch), "rasana" is "rasa"
(taste), "gandhana" is "gandha" (smell), "varnana" is "varna" (color), and
"shabdana" is "shabda" (sound). The order of these is explained according to the
order of the senses. 8301. Here it is said that since the mind is not a sense
organ, it is not useful. But it is useful. Without it, the senses would not be
able to fulfill their respective purposes in the objects. And, is the only
purpose of the mind to help the senses, or is there another purpose? To answer
this, the next sutra says: Shruta is the object of the mind. ||21|| $ 302. The
object of Shruta-jnana (knowledge of scriptures) is Shruta. It is the object of
the mind, because when a being has attained the destruction and cessation of the
covering of Shruta-jnana, then the mind, relying on itself, engages in knowledge
of the object of Shruta-jnana. Or, Shruta means Shruta-jnana, and that is the
purpose of the mind. This purpose is independent of the mind. $ 303. In order to
determine the ownership of the senses, which have definite objects, the first
sense that was taken up was touch. To determine the ownership of touch, the next
sutra says: For beings with bodies ending in plants, there is one. ||22|| 1. -

## Chapter Two  **8304.** The word "ekam" in the sutra means "first". Question:
What is it? Answer: Touch. Question: Which beings have it? Answer: It should be
known that it is present in beings from the earth-bodied to the plant-bodied.
Now, the cause of its origin is stated: When the obstruction of the potency and
the covering of the touch sense organ karma are destroyed and subsided, and when
the remaining senses are overpowered by the arising of the all-destroying
competitors, and when the body name karma is supported, and when the one-sense
category name karma is dependent, then a single touch sense organ manifests.
**8305.** Now, to show the ownership of the other senses, the next sutra says:
"Worm, ant, bee, and human, etc., have one-one sense organ more in succession."
|| 23 ||  **8306.** "Ekak" is a double meaning in the sense of repetition. The
senses have increased one by one, therefore they are called "ekakavrudha". These
senses have increased from the worm onwards. The touch sense organ is dominant,
therefore, from the touch sense organ onwards, they have increased one by one,
thus the connection should be made. The word "adi" is connected with each. This
means that the worm, etc., beings have two senses: touch and taste. The ant,
etc., beings have three senses: touch, taste, and smell. The bee, etc., beings
have four senses: touch, taste, smell, and sight. The human, etc., beings have
five senses when the hearing sense organ is added to the previous four. Thus,
the explanation of the connection between the mentioned beings and senses is
given in order. The origin of the touch sense organ has been explained earlier,
similarly, the origin of the remaining senses should be explained. But while
explaining the cause of origin, the explanation should be given along with the
arising of the all-destroying competitors related to the next sense organ whose
cause of origin is being explained.  **8307.** Thus, in these two types of
beings and with respect to the five types of sense organ differences, the five-
sensed beings are not mentioned, therefore, to state them, the next sutra says:

unhe hi sanji kahte hain. Parishesh nyay se yah siddha hua ki in se atitarik
jitne sansari jiva hote hain ve sab asanji hote hain. Shanka sutra mein
'sanjnah' itna pad dene se hi kam chal jata hai, atah 'samanaskah' yah visheshan
dena nishphal hai, kyonki hit ki prapti aur ahit ke tyag ki pariksha karne mein
man ka vyapar hota hai aur yahi sanjna hai? Samadhan-yah kahna uchit nahin,
kyonki sanjna shabd ke arth mein vyabhicar paya jata hain. Arthat sanjna shabd
ke anek arth hain. Sanjna ka arth nam hai. Yadi nam vale jiva sanji mane jaye to
sab jivo ko sanji pane ka prasang prapt hota hai. Sanjna ka arth yadi jnan liya
jata hai to bhi sabhi pranin jnan svatav ho ne se sab ko sanji pane ka prasang
prapt hota hai. Yadi aharad adi vishayo ki abhilasha ko sanjna kaha jata hai to
bhi pahle ke saman dosh prapt hota hai. Arthat aharad adi vishayak abhilasha sab
ke payi jati hai, isliye bhi sab ko sanji pane ka prasang prapt hota hai. Chunki
ye dosh na prapt hon atah sutra mein 'samanaskah' yah pad rakha hai. Isse yah
labh hai ki garbh j, andaj, mucchhit aur susupti adi avasthaon mein hitahit ki

Vishesharth-prayah ekendriya adi pratyek jiva apne isht vishay mein pravritti
karta hai aur anishta vishay se nivritta hota hai, fir bhi man ko svatantra

sakte. Isi se man ki svatantra satta svikar ki gayi hai. Yah man jin ke hota hai

[133 -21268 312] Chapter Two $ 310. Vigraha is the body. Vigraha means the
movement that is for the body. Or, Vigraha means the opposite of Graha, which
means obstruction. The meaning is that even when Karma is taken, there is no
taking of non-Karma Pudgalas, and there is no obstruction. With Vigraha, there
is Vigraha-Gati. The Karmic body, which is the seed of the growth of all bodies,
is called Karma. Yoga is the movement of the Atma-Pradesha, which is caused by
the Vachan-Vargana, Mano-Vargana, and Kaya-Vargana. The Yoga that is done by
Karma is called Karma-Yoga, and it happens in Vigraha-Gati. This is the meaning
of the statement. From this, there is the taking of new Karma and the movement
from one country to another. 311. It is said that the movement of Jivas and
Pudgalas from one country to another is done by the order of the Akasha-
Pradeshas, or without it. Now, to explain this, the next Sutra is said: The
movement is according to the श्रेणी. ॥26॥ 8312. From the middle of the Lok,
upwards, downwards, and sideways, the order of the Akasha-Pradeshas is called
श्रेणी. The word 'Anu' is used in the sense of 'Anupurvi'. Therefore, 'Anu-
Shreni' means 'according to the order of the श्रेणी'. This is the movement of
Jivas and Pudgalas. The question is, how can Pudgalas be taken here, since they
are not authorized? The answer is that the word 'Gati' is taken in the Sutra,
which proves that unauthorized Pudgalas are also intended here. If only the
movement of Jivas was intended, then there would have been no need to take the
word 'Gati' in the Sutra, because the taking of the word 'Gati' is proven by
authority. Secondly, the word 'Jiva' is taken in the next Sutra, so it is known
that Pudgalas are also intended in this Sutra. The question is, the movement of
the Jyotishkas like the Moon, etc., and the movement of the Vidyadharas, etc.,
in the clockwise direction of the Meru is seen, so why is it said that the
movement of Jivas and Pudgalas is Anu-Shreni? The answer is that the time and
space rules should be known here. The time rule is as follows: when a Jiva
leaves one Bhav at the time of death, 1. -व्याघातः । नोकर्म-ता., ना.। 2.

134] Sarvarthasiddhi [2126 § 312 The movement of living beings at the time of
death, and the upward movement of liberated beings at the time of their
transition to another existence, is always in a straight line. The rule of the
country is also upward, downward, or sideways. The movement of pudgalas, which
reaches the end of the world, is also in a straight line. Other movements are
possible. 8 313. To further explain the special types of movement, the next
sutra says: The movement of a liberated being is without obstruction. ||27|| $
314 Obstruction means hindrance or crookedness. The movement that is without
obstruction is the movement that is without hindrance or crookedness. Whose
movement is this? Of a living being. What kind of living being? A liberated
being. How do we know that the movement of a liberated being is without
obstruction? The next sutra uses the word "samsari" (worldly), which indicates
that this sutra is referring to the movement of a liberated being. But the
previous sutra already explained that there is no transition from one category
to another. What is the purpose of this sutra? This sutra is meant to indicate
that there is sometimes movement in a straight line. But the previous sutra
already mentioned the rules of the country and time. No, because this sutra
proves it. $ 315. If it is claimed that the movement of a liberated soul is
without obstruction and reaches the end of the world in a fixed time, then what
about the movement of a worldly soul? Is it obstructed or is it without
obstruction like the movement of a liberated soul? The next sutra answers this
question: The movement of a worldly being is both without obstruction and with
obstruction. The movement with obstruction occurs before the fourth time, that

## Chapter Two  [135 $ 316. The term 'Praak Chaturvya' is used to determine
time. The word 'Praak' signifies a limit, meaning that motion with a bend occurs
before the fourth time, but not in the fourth time. Why is this so? Because in a
Nishkuta Kshetra, where the most excellent bend-causing factors are present, a
being born in that Nishkuta Kshetra, due to the absence of an Anupurvi Anushreni
Bhava, does not have Ishu Gati. Therefore, this being starts a motion with three
bends to attain the Nishkuta Kshetra. There is no need for more bends because
there is no such Uppapad Kshetra. Therefore, motion with bends occurs only for
three times, not in the fourth time. The word 'Cha' signifies a collection,
which includes both motion with bends and motion without bends.  [317. The time
for motion with bends has been determined. Now, to understand how much time is
for motion without bends, the next sutra states:  Motion with one time is
without bends. ||29||  [318. The motion that takes one time is called motion
with one time. The motion that does not have a bend, or a turn, is called motion
without bends. For beings and Pudgalas that are in motion, motion with one time
occurs even up to the end of the Lok, due to the absence of any obstruction.
[319. In the continuous chain of Karma Bandha, which is without beginning, due
to the influence of Mithyadarshana and other wrong beliefs, a being who receives
Karma, also receives Aharaka even in motion with bends. Therefore, to establish
a rule, the next sutra states:  A being remains without Aharaka for one, two, or
three times. ||30||  [320. Due to the authority of time, there is a connection
with it here. The word 'Va' signifies an alternative, and the alternative is
taken as far as it is intended. The meaning is that a being can remain without
Aharaka for one time, two times, or three times. For three bodies, there are six
Paryaptis.

##  [136] Sarvartha Siddhi  [2131 $ 321] The intake of suitable pudgalas is
called Aahar. The absence of this is called Anaahar. The intake of karma is
continuous in the state of the karmic body. When the jiva is moving towards the
upapadakshetra, it is called Aahar. In the other three times, it is called
Anaahar. 8321. Thus, to explain the different types of birth of a jiva entering
a new murti, the sutra says:  Sammurchhana, Garbha and Upapad are the (three)
types of birth. ||31|| 8322. In the three lokas, above, below and sideways, the
complete absorption of the body is called Sammurchhana. This means the
absorption of pudgalas from all sides to form the body. The mixture of shukra
and shonit in the womb of a woman is called Garbha. Or, the absorption of the
food consumed by the mother is called Garbha. The place where the jiva enters
and starts moving is called Upapad. Upapad is a specific name for the place of
birth of devas and narakas. These three are the types of birth for the jiva in
samsara, which are the results of different karmas that bind due to auspicious
and inauspicious consequences.  323. So far, we have discussed the birth that is
the basis for the enjoyment and experience of the objects of samsara. Now, we
should discuss the different types of yonis. Therefore, the next sutra says:
Sachitta, Sheet and Samvrita, and their opposites Achitta, Ushna and Vivrita,
and the mixture of these, i.e., Sachitta-achitta, Sheet-ushna and Samvrita-
vivrita, are the yonis of birth. ||32|| 8324. The special manifestation of the
soul's chaitanya is called Chitta. The one who lives with Chitta is called
Sachitta. Sheet is a type of touch. Like shukla, etc., it is a word for both the
substance and the quality. Samvrita means completely surrounded.

## Chapter Two  **The concept of "Durupa Lakshya Pradesh" is explained.**
**"Setara" means "those who exist with others," implying "with opposing
elements."**  **Question: Who are these "others"?**  **Answer:** They are those
who are **achit** (non-conscious), **ushna** (hot), and **vivrut** (open). Those
who are **ubhayatmaka** (dualistic) are called **mishra** (mixed). For example,
**sachitta-achitta** (conscious-non-conscious), **shito-ushna** (cold-hot), and
**samvrit-vivrut** (closed-open).  **The word "cha" (and) indicates a collective
sense, implying that there are also mixed types of yonis.** Otherwise, "mishra"
would simply be an adjective for the previously mentioned types.  **The word
"ekasha" (one by one) is used for emphasis.** It is included in the sutra to
emphasize the sequential and mixed nature of the yonis. This helps us understand
that the yonis are **sachitta**, **achitta**, **sheet**, **ushna**, **samvrit**,
and **vivrut** in that order. It is not meant to be understood as **sachitta**,
**sheet**, etc.  **The word "tat" (that) is used to indicate the different types
of birth.** It implies that these yonis are the sources of births like
**sammurchhana** (fainting) and others.  **In total, there are nine yonis to be
understood.**  **Question: Is there no difference between yoni and birth?**
**Answer: No, there is a difference due to the distinction between "adhara"
(base) and "adhey" (dependent).** These **sachitta** etc. yonis are the
**adharas**, and the different types of birth are the **adheyas**. This is
because the soul, residing in the **sachitta** etc. yonis, acquires **pudgalas**
(particles) suitable for the body, food, and senses through births like
**sammurchhana**.  **Devas (gods) and Narakas (hell beings) have achitta
yonis.** This is because their **upapadadesha** (place of origin) is made up of
**pudgalaprachay** (accumulation of particles), which is **achitta**.
**Garbhajas (those born from the womb) have mishra yonis.** This is because the
**shukra** (semen) and **shonit** (blood) in the mother's womb are **achitta**,
and they mix with the **sachitta** soul of the mother, resulting in a **mishra
yoni**.  **Sammurchhanajas (those born through fainting) have three types of
yonis.** Some have **sachitta yonis**, others have **achitta yonis**, and some
have **mishra yonis**.  **Those with ordinary bodies have sachitta yonis.** This
is because they depend on each other for survival.  **The remaining sammurchhana
beings have both achitta and mishra yonis.**  **Devas and Narakas have both
sheet and ushna yonis.** This is because their **upapadasthanas** (places of
origin) are some cold and some hot.  **Tejaskaayikas (those with a fiery body)
have ushna yonis.**  **The remaining beings have three types of yonis.** Some
have **sheet yonis**, some have **ushna yonis**, and some have **mishra yonis**.

(closed womb) with one sense organ. The *Vikalendriya* (disabled) are of the
*Vivrita Yoni* (open womb). The *Garbhaja* (born from the womb) are of the
*Mishra Yoni* (mixed womb). There are eighty-four hundred thousand types of
these Yonis, as known from the *Agamas* (sacred texts). It is said: "There are
seven hundred thousand *Nitya Nigoda* (eternal beings), seven hundred thousand
*Itara Nigoda* (other beings), seven hundred thousand *Prithvi Kayika* (earth-
bodied beings), seven hundred thousand *Jal Kayika* (water-bodied beings), seven
hundred thousand *Agni Kayika* (fire-bodied beings), seven hundred thousand
*Vayu Kayika* (air-bodied beings), ten hundred thousand *Vrikshas* (trees), six
hundred thousand *Vikalendriya* (disabled), four hundred thousand *Deva*
(celestial beings), four hundred thousand *Naraka* (hellish beings), and
fourteen hundred thousand *Tiryancha* (animals) and *Manushya* (humans)." 8325.
Thus, in this predicament of nine *Yonis* and three births, which are obtained
by all living beings without any control, the following *Sutra* (aphorism) is
stated to determine your understanding: The *Jarayuja* (born from the womb),
*Andaja* (born from eggs), and *Pota* (born from the womb) have *Garbha Janma*
(birth from the womb). ||33|| 8326. The *Jarayu* (womb) is like a net, which is
the covering of the living being and is made of flesh and blood. The *Anda*
(egg) is like the skin of a nail, hard, round, and its covering is made of semen
and blood. The *Pota* (born from the womb) is a being whose all limbs are
complete without any covering, and who is born from the womb with the ability to
move and act. Those born from the *Jarayu* (womb) are called *Jarayuja* (born
from the womb). Those born from the *Anda* (egg) are called *Andaja* (born from
eggs). The *Sutra* (aphorism) uses the *Dvandva Samasa* (compound word) for
*Jarayuja* (born from the womb), *Andaja* (born from eggs), and *Pota* (born
from the womb). All these are *Garbha Yoni* (wombs). 327. If the *Garbha Janma*
(birth from the womb) of these *Jarayuja* (born from the womb), *Andaja* (born
from eggs), and *Pota* (born from the womb) is determined, then tell us which
beings have *Upapada Janma* (birth from the womb). Therefore, the following
*Sutra* (aphorism) is stated to give knowledge about this: The *Deva* (celestial
beings) and *Naraka* (hellish beings) have *Upapada Janma* (birth from the
womb). ||34|| 1. *Moolachar* (Primary Conduct), *Ga* (Chapter) 5.29 and 12.63 1
*Go* (Chapter), *Ji* (Chapter), *Ga* (Chapter).

-2136 8331] Chapter Two [13 8 328. Now, regarding the birth of other beings, it
is said: The remaining beings have *sammurchana* birth. ||35|| 8329. The
remaining beings are those other than those born from the womb and *upapada*.
Their birth is *sammurchana*. These three sutras are for the purpose of
establishing a rule. The rule should be understood from both sides. The womb
birth is only for the *jarayuj*, *andaj*, and *pot* beings. Or, the *jarayuj*,
*andaj*, and *pot* beings have only womb birth. The *upapada* birth is only for
the gods and hell beings. Or, the gods and hell beings have only *upapada*
birth. The *sammurchana* birth is only for the remaining beings. Or, the
remaining beings have only *sammurchana* birth. 8330. Now, regarding the bodies
of those beings who are transmigrating, who are born from three types of births,
who have many variations and nine types of wombs, and whose bodies are the
result of the fruition of auspicious and inauspicious *karma*, and who are the
basis for experiencing the fruits of bondage, it is said: There are five bodies:
*audarik*, *vaikriyik*, *aharaka*, *taijas*, and *karman*. ||36|| 8331. The
bodies are those which, having been obtained through the arising of specific
*karma*, decay. The *audarik* etc. are those which are obtained through the
arising of specific natures. *Udara* means gross. *Audarik* is derived from the
word *udara* by adding the suffix *ika* to denote the meaning of being born from
*udara* or having *udara* as its purpose. *Vaikriyik* is that which has the
purpose of *vikriya*, which is the creation of a body of various sizes, small
and large, through the power of the eight qualities of *aishwarya* (divine
powers). *Aharaka* is that which is created by a *pramatta-samyata* (one who is
careless and restrained) in order to know subtle objects or to desire to
overcome *asamyam* (lack of restraint). *Taijas* is that which is caused by
*tejas* (light) or is born in *tejas*. *Karman* is the work of *karma*. Although
all bodies are caused by *karma*, due to convention, the specific body is called
the *karman* body. 1. 'The body is the support of the sense organs and their
objects.' *Nyaya Sutra* 1, 1, 11. 2. *Udara* means *audarik*. *Udara* *Muni*.

## Sarvarthasiddhi   **8332.** How do the senses perceive the Audārika body but
not the other bodies? To explain this, we present the next sūtra: The subsequent
body is more subtle. ||37||  **8333.** Although the word "para" has multiple
meanings, here it signifies the order of the bodies. Even though the bodies are
distinct, they are connected by the subtle qualities. This is indicated by the
word "paramparām". The Audārika body is gross. The Vaikriya body is more subtle
than the Audārika. The Āhārika body is more subtle than the Vaikriya. The Tejas
body is more subtle than the Āhārika. And the Kārmaṇa body is more subtle than
the Tejas.  **8334.** If the subsequent bodies are more subtle, then they should
also be smaller in terms of their regions. To address this contradiction, we
present the next sūtra:  **8335.** The three bodies preceding the Tejas body are
infinitely larger in terms of their regions than the subsequent body. ||38||
The word "pradeśa" is derived from "pradiśyante", meaning "atoms". What is
beyond number is called "asanख्येय". A body with an infinite number of atoms is
called "asanख्येयguṇa". The question arises: In comparison to what? The answer
is: In comparison to the regions, not in comparison to the perception. The word
"paramparām" from the previous sūtra implies that the Kārmaṇa body is also
infinitely large. To address this, the sūtra uses the phrase "prāk tejasāt".
This means that the bodies preceding the Tejas body are infinitely larger than
the subsequent body. The Vaikriya body is infinitely larger in terms of its
regions than the Audārika body. The question arises: What is the measure of this
infinite number of atoms? The answer is: A fraction of a palya. The question
arises: If this is the case, then the subsequent bodies would be infinitely
larger than the previous bodies. The answer is: This is not a problem because
due to the specific nature of the bond, there is no difference in size. This is
like a pile of cotton and a ball of iron.  **8336.** Are the regions of the
subsequent two bodies equal, or is there some difference? To answer this, we
present the next sūtra:

## Chapter Two: The Infinitely Numerous Qualities of the Soul  **39.** The term
"pradeshato" (from the region) is carried over from the previous sutra. Thus,
the connection should be made: the regions of the taijas (luminous) body are
infinitely numerous compared to the aharak (food-consuming) body, and the
regions of the karman (action) body are infinitely numerous compared to the
taijas body. What is the multiplier? The multiplier is the infinite part of the
liberated souls and the infinite number of the unliberated souls.  **40.**
**Objection:** Just as a nail, etc., prevents a being from going to its desired
place, similarly, due to being constituted by material substance, the samsari
(worldly) jiva (soul) is faced with the possibility of being prevented from
attaining its desired liberation. **Solution:** This is not a fault, because
both these bodies are free from obstruction.  **39.** The obstruction of one
material substance by another material substance is called "pratighata"
(obstruction). There is no such obstruction between these two bodies, hence they
are free from obstruction. Just as fire, due to its subtle nature, enters an
iron ball, similarly, there is no obstruction between the taijas and karman
bodies and things like a vajra (diamond) plate, etc. **Objection:** There is no
obstruction between the vaikriyik (transforming) and aharak bodies either, then
why are only the taijas and karman bodies called obstruction-free? **Solution:**
The absence of obstruction is intended here in a general sense. Just as the
taijas and karman bodies are free from obstruction everywhere in the world, this
is not the case with the vaikriyik and aharak bodies.  **40.** **Question:** Is
this the only difference between these two bodies, or is there any other
difference? **Answer:** The next sutra explains this.  **41.** They are
eternally connected with the soul.  **8341.** The word "cha" (and) in the sutra
indicates an alternative. This means: 1. They are eternally connected with the
soul, and they are infinitely numerous compared to the previous bodies. 2. They
are infinitely numerous compared to the previous bodies, and they are free from
obstruction.

[142] **Sarvarthasiddhi** [2141 $ 341 The Taijasa and Karmana bodies have an
Anadi (beginningless) and Sadi (beginningful) relationship, like a seed and a
tree. The Audarika, Vaikriyika, and Aharaka bodies are sometimes present in a
Jiva, but not the Taijasa and Karmana bodies. They are always connected to the
Jiva until the end of Samsara. 8342. Whether these Taijasa and Karmana bodies
are present in all Jivas or only in some, is explained in the next Sutra:
**Sarvasya** [421] 8343. The word "Sarva" means "all". It means that both these
bodies are present in all Jivas in Samsara. 8344. To show that all Jivas in
Samsara are connected to the Taijasa and Karmana bodies, and to show the
possibility of different combinations of bodies, the next Sutra says:
**Tadadiani Bhajyani Yugaparde Kasyacatuvyaha** [43] 8345. The word "Tat" refers
to the Taijasa and Karmana bodies mentioned earlier. "Tadadi" means those who
have the Taijasa and Karmana bodies as their beginning. "Bhajyani" and
"Vikalpini" are synonyms, meaning "optional". The meaning is that a Jiva can
have two to four bodies at the same time. One Jiva may have the Taijasa and
Karmana bodies. Another may have the Audarika, Taijasa, and Karmana bodies, or
the Vaikriyika, Taijasa, and Karmana bodies. Another may have the Audarika,
Aharaka, Taijasa, and Karmana bodies. This is the division that is made here.
**Explanation:** The 47th Sutra mentions the birth of a Vaikriyika body through
the power of special Tapas. Therefore, the question arises whether a Siddha
(enlightened being) can have five bodies at the same time. 1. - Sambandhe'pi ca
muh. 2. - Deka-sminna ca - mu.

-2144 $ 347] Chapter Two 8 346. To further explain the specific characteristics
of these bodies, the following sutra is stated: The last body is without
enjoyment. ||44|| 8347. The last one is called the last. What is it? It is the
karmic body. The enjoyment of sounds etc. through the sensory channels is called
enjoyment. This is not found in the last body; therefore, it is without
enjoyment. Even though there is a movement of the subtle body, there is no
enjoyment of sounds etc. because there is no formation of the gross sensory
organs. Question: The luminous body is also without enjoyment, so why is it said
here that the last body is without enjoyment? Answer: The luminous body is not
even a cause in yoga, therefore, it has no authority in the consideration of
enjoyment. What is the harm in believing that? The solution is that the Vaikriya
and Aharaka Riddhi do not occur simultaneously, so one cannot have a Vaikriya
body along with an Aharaka body. Secondly, the reaction that is obtained from
special austerities is related to the Audarika body. It is not appropriate to
consider it as an independent Vaikriya body. In the karma literature, the body
obtained from the rise of the Vaikriya body karma is counted as the Vaikriya
body. Therefore, due to the difference in authority, the Vaikriya body cannot be
formed along with the Audarika and Aharaka bodies. This is the reason why a
maximum of four bodies have been mentioned. 8346. To further explain the
specific characteristics of these bodies, the following sutra is stated: The
last body is without enjoyment. ||44|| 8347. The last one is called the last.
Question: What is the last body? Answer: The karmic body. The enjoyment of
sounds etc. through the sensory channels is called enjoyment. This is not found
in the last body; therefore, it is without enjoyment. Even though there is a
movement of the subtle body, there is no enjoyment of sounds etc. because there
is no formation of the gross sensory organs. Question: The luminous body is also
without enjoyment, so why is it said here that the last body is without
enjoyment? Answer: The luminous body is not even a cause in yoga, therefore, it
has no authority in the consideration of enjoyment. For special purposes, the
Audarika, Vaikriya, and Aharaka bodies have sensory organs formed in them, and
through them, they enjoy their respective objects. Therefore, these three bodies
are considered to be with enjoyment. Although the karmic body yoga occurs only
for the Kevalis, at the time of their liberation and the filling of the world,
and during the movement of the subtle body, but during the time of liberation
and the filling of the world, there is only knowledge, so the question of
enjoyment does not arise there. Only during the movement of the subtle body,
when the karmic body yoga is present, the question arises whether there is
enjoyment or not. And to answer this question, the sutra "Nirupobhogamantyam"
has been composed. While explaining why the last body is without enjoyment, it
has been stated that during the movement of the subtle body, there are subtle
senses but no gross senses, therefore, there is no enjoyment of objects like
sounds etc. This is the reason why the last body is called without enjoyment. As
for the luminous body, it does not have its own independent authority like the
other four bodies. The non-released luminous body is always present in all
sentient beings, and the released luminous body is occasional. Thus, the
luminous body is found in all sentient beings, but it is not a cause in the
self-consciousness, therefore, it is not considered useful in enjoying objects
through the senses. This is the reason why the question of whether the luminous
body is without enjoyment or with enjoyment does not arise. 1. -No authority. It
is said there-Ta., Na.

144] Sarvarthasiddhi [2145 § 348 348. In the births described with these
characteristics, are all bodies born in the same way, or is there any
difference? To answer this, the next Sutra says: The first body is born from the
womb and from unconsciousness. ||45|| § 349: According to the order of the
Sutras, the word *ādy* refers to the *audārika* body. Whatever is born from the
womb and from unconsciousness, all that should be considered *audārika*. 8350.
After this, the next Sutra tells us from which birth the body described next is
born: The *aupapādika* body is born from *upapāda*. ||46|| 8351. What is born in
*upapāda* is called *aupapādika*. All such bodies should be known as
*vaikriyika*. 8352. If the *aupapādika* body is *vaikriyika*, then the body that
is not *aupapādika* cannot be *vaikriyika*. To clarify this, the next Sutra
says: It is also born from *labdhi*. ||47|| 8353. The word *ca* in the Sutra
connects with the *vaikriyika* body. *Labdhi* is the attainment of *ṛddhi*
through special austerities. The *labdhi* that is the cause of this is called
*labdhi-pratyaya*. The *vaikriyika* body is also *labdhi-pratyaya*. This is the
connection to be made here. 8354. Is this the only body that is born from
*labdhi*, or is there another one? To answer this, the next Sutra says: The
*tejas* body is also born from *labdhi*. ||48||

## Chapter Two  [2149 8358] Chapter Two [145 6355] The word 'api' (also) refers
to the 'labdhi-pratyaya' (gaining body). This means that the Tejas body is also
a 'labdhi-pratyaya'. [356] After the Vaikriya body, the following sutra
describes the nature of the body and its owner: The Aharaka body is auspicious,
pure, non-violent, and belongs only to the Pramattasanyata. ||49|| [8357] It is
called auspicious because it is the cause of auspicious karma. This body is the
cause of auspicious karma, which is the Aharaka Kaya Yoga, hence it is called
auspicious. Here, the effect is used to describe the cause. Just like food is
called 'pran' (life) because it is the cause of life. It is called pure because
it is the effect of pure karma. The Aharaka body is called pure because it is
the effect of pure karma, which is free from defects and is a virtuous karma.
Here, the cause is used to describe the effect. Just like cotton is called
'tantu' (thread) because it is the cause of thread. It is non-violent because it
does not cause harm to any other body, nor does any other body cause harm to it.
The word 'cha' (and) is used to indicate the combined purpose of the Aharaka
body. For example, the Aharaka body is created to indicate the presence of
specific gains, to determine subtle substances, and to protect the restraint.
The word 'Aharaka' refers to the Aharaka body mentioned earlier. When the soul
begins to create the Aharaka body, it becomes 'pramatta' (distracted), hence the
sutra says that the Aharaka body belongs only to the 'Pramattasanyata'. The word
'eva' (only) is used to emphasize the intended meaning. This means that the
Aharaka body belongs only to the 'Pramattasanyata' and not to anyone else.
However, it does not mean that only the 'Pramattasanyata' has the Aharaka body.
This means that the 'Pramattasanyata' does not have the Audarika and other
bodies. Therefore, the word 'eva' is used along with the word 'Pramattasanyata'.
[8358] What is the state of the transmigrating souls who possess these bodies in
each of their movements? 1. The karma of virtue...

146] It is asked whether there is any such thing as a neuter gender. To this,
the text says: **All-purpose accomplishment:** Naraka-sammoochhina are neuter.
||50|| 8359. Narakas will be discussed later. Those who are born in Narakas are
called Narakas. Sammoochchhana is sammoochchha, those who have it are called
sammoochchhina. Naraka and sammoochchhina are both called Naraka-sammoochchhina.
Due to the arousal of the neuter knowledge of the four types of karma -
charitra, moha, vikalpa, and nokashaya, and the arousal of the inauspicious
karma, they become neither male nor female, but neuter. It is a rule that
Naraka-sammoochchhina are only neuter. For there, there is no even slight amount
of pleasure, even in the form of pleasant sounds, smells, sights, tastes, and
touches, which are related to the objects of the mind, namely, women and men. $
360. If this is established, then it is understood that other beings in the
cycle of birth and death are tri-linga, i.e., they have three genders. To
explain this, where there is a complete absence of the neuter gender, the text
says: -2150 § 359] Not the Devas. ||51|| 8361. Devas experience the supreme
pleasure of the male and female genders, which is related to the auspicious
karma of good birth. Therefore, there are no neuters among them. $ 362. Then, it
is asked, what about the other beings? To this, the text says: The rest are tri-
veda. ||52|| 8 363. Those who have three vedas are called tri-veda. What are
these three vedas? They are femaleness, maleness, and neuterness. Are there
three genders, or is there a separate rule for gender? To explain this, the next
sutra says: Naraka and sammoochchhina are neuter. ||50|| 8359. We will discuss
Narakas later. Those who are born in Narakas are called Narakas. Sammoochchhana
is sammoochchha, those who have it are called sammoochchhina. The sutra uses the
compound word Naraka-sammoochchhina, which means both Naraka and sammoochchhina.
There are two types of charitra-moha karma: kapaya and nokashaya. The arousal of
the neuter knowledge from the nokashaya karma and the arousal of the
inauspicious karma cause the beings to become neither male nor female, but
neuter. Here, it is important to understand that Naraka-sammoochchhina are only
neuter. These beings do not experience even a slight amount of pleasure related
to the objects of the mind, namely, women and men, which arises from pleasant
sounds, smells, sights, tastes, and touches. $ 360. If the neuter knowledge of
the above beings is established, then it is understood that other beings in the
cycle of birth and death are tri-linga, i.e., they have three genders. To
explain this, where there is a complete absence of the neuter gender, the next
sutra says: Devas are not neuter. ||51|| $ 361. Devas experience the supreme
pleasure of the male and female genders, which is related to the auspicious
karma of good birth. Therefore, there are no neuters among them.  $ 362. To
explain what about the other beings, the next sutra says: The rest are tri-veda.
||52|| 8363. Those who have three vedas are called tri-veda. The question
arises: what are these three vedas? 1. masti, 2. sammoo, 3. tyantanapur, 4.
neuter gender.

## Chapter Two  [147] How is their (the beings') attainment (of a body) known?
It is known through the Veda. This is the meaning of Linga. It is of two types:
Dravya-linga and Bhava-linga. Dravya-linga is established by the arising of
name-karma like Yoni, Mehana, etc. Bhava-linga is established by the arising of
No-kṣaya. From the arising of Stri-veda, there is a womb, hence a woman. From
the arising of Puruṣa-veda, one gives birth to offspring, hence a man. From the
arising of Napuṁsaka-veda, one is devoid of both these powers, hence a eunuch.
These are established words. In established words, action is for the sake of
etymology. For example, one who goes is a cow. Otherwise, if the meaning of the
word is taken as primarily based on the action of bearing a child, etc., then
there would be no designation of woman, etc., for children, old people, animals,
humans, gods, and those who are in the state of Karmaṇakāya-yoga, as they do not
have the action of bearing a child, etc. These three Vedas are for the remaining
beings, i.e., those born from a womb.  8364. Those beings who are described as
having different characteristics related to birth, womb, body, and linga, like
gods, etc., who are controlled by various virtues and vices, and who hold bodies
in the four states of existence, do they attain other bodies after enjoying
their lifespan in due time, or do they attain other bodies even before their
lifespan is complete? To answer this, the next sūtra says:  Those who are born
from Upāpadaka, who have the highest body, and who have a lifespan of countless
years, are those who have no lifespan. ||53||  1. Man. Both of them - A., Di. 1

[148] Sarvartha Siddhi [2153 83658365. This is an explanation of the Aupapādika,
which are the Devas and Narakas. The word "charma" means "final". The word
"uttama" means "excellent". Those whose bodies are final and excellent are
called "charmotama deha" (bodies of the highest excellence). The meaning is that
those whose samsara is near, that is, those who are about to attain liberation
in the same bhava, are called "charmotama deha". Asankhyeya is a special
quantity that is beyond number. The meaning is that those whose lifespan is
known by means of similes like "palya" etc., are called those who have an
immeasurable lifespan, born in the Tiryanch and Manushya realms, in the
Uttarakuru etc. Those who have Aupapādika birth and also have charmotama deha,
and also have an immeasurable lifespan, are called Aupapādika charmotama deha
asankhyeya varsha ayush (those with an immeasurable lifespan, having the highest
excellence of body, born from Aupapādika birth). If there is an external cause
of harm, such as poison, weapons, etc., the lifespan becomes short, which is
called "apavarya" (diminished lifespan). Those whose lifespan is diminished are
called "apavayuṣa" (those with diminished lifespan). Those whose lifespan is not
diminished are called "anpavaayuṣa" (those with undiminished lifespan). For
these Aupapādika etc. beings, their lifespan does not diminish due to external
causes, this is a rule, and for the rest of the beings, there is no such rule.
The adjective "uttama" in the sutra is given to show the excellence of the
charma body. There is no other special meaning here. Or, in place of the reading
"charmotama deha", the reading "charma deha" is also found. Special Meaning -
The lifespan that is being enjoyed does not increase, it can only be diminished
by being stimulated, so the question arises whether the lifespan of all beings
in samsara diminishes or if there is an exception to this. The present sutra is
composed in answer to this question. It states that the lifespan of the Devas
and Narakas who are born from Aupapādika birth, the Manushya who are about to
attain liberation from that birth, and the Tiryanch and Manushya who have an
immeasurable lifespan, does not diminish. They enjoy their full lifespan and
then the end of that period comes. The reason for making this special rule is
that according to karma-shastra, the karma that is obtained can be enjoyed in a
short time when both the causes are present, except for the karma of
"nikachana", "nidhatti" and "upashamakaran". This rule also applies to the
lifespan that is being enjoyed, so this sutra establishes that this rule does
not apply to the lifespan of the aforementioned beings. The intention is that at
the beginning of the enjoyment of their lifespan, the niṣekas (seeds) of their
lifespan are gradually manifested one by one and then they reach their end. They
are not harmed by external causes like poison, weapons, etc. But this does not
mean that their lifespan karma is not stimulated. It is possible for them to be
stimulated, but this stimulation does not cause the destruction of the niṣekas.
By "destruction of the niṣekas", we mean that their full niṣekas are not
destroyed by stimulation. The sutra uses the term "charmotama deha" for those
who are about to attain liberation from that birth. In the Sarvartha Siddhi
tika, while explaining this, the charma body is considered to be the uttama
(excellent) body, but in the Tattvarth Rajavatika, first, a separate meaning is
given to charma deha and uttama deha, but later, the body of Chakradhara etc.,
who have uttama deha, is considered to have apavarya ayu (diminished lifespan),
and the word "uttama" is used to mean... 1. -dehaḥ. Viparita- Mu. 2. Ityarthaḥ.

-2153 $ 365] Chapter Two [149 This rule states that the lifespan of *padika* and
others is diminished due to external causes. This is not the rule for others.
The taking of the best is not a separate meaning for the purpose of
demonstrating the excellence of the final body. Or the reading is 'final body'.
Thus ends the second chapter of the *Tattvartha-vritti*, known as
*Sarvarthasiddhi*. ||2|| The final body has been taken as an adjective. One
thing is clear that there has been a dispute about the word *uttama* from the
beginning. That is why in *Sarvarthasiddhi*, the reading 'final body' has been
indicated as a variant reading, and this variant reading was received by them
from the previous tradition. Thus ends the second chapter of the *Tattvartha-

## Chapter Three  **366.** The term "Nārakas" is mentioned in the sūtra
"Bhavapratyayo'vadhidevanārakāṇām" and so on. Therefore, the question arises:
who are these Nārakas? To explain this, we will now describe their dwelling
places.  **1.** There are seven earths: Ratnaprabhā, Śarkarāprabhā,
Valukāprabhā, Paṅkaprabhā, Dhūmaprabhā, Tamaḥprabhā, and Mahātamaḥprabhā. These
are supported by dense water, wind, and space, and are situated one below the
other.  **800.** The compound "Ratnaśarkarāvālukapāṅkadhūmatamomahātāmāḥ" is a
dvandva compound. The word "Prabhā" should be understood as being connected to
each of the preceding words. This is due to the principle of saṃhācarya (mutual
association). The earth whose brilliance is like that of jewels like citra etc.
is called Ratnaprabhā. The earth whose brilliance is like that of sugar is
called Śarkarāprabhā. The earth whose brilliance is like that of sand is called
Valukāprabhā. The earth whose brilliance is like that of mud is called
Paṅkaprabhā. The earth whose brilliance is like that of smoke is called
Dhūmaprabhā. The earth whose brilliance is like that of darkness is called
Tamaḥprabhā. The earth whose brilliance is like that of intense darkness is
called Mahātamaḥprabhā. These names are derived in this way. The word "Bhūmi" is
used to indicate the specific dwelling place. Just as the celestial realms are
not situated on earth, so too are the dwelling places of the Nārakas not
situated on earth. What then? They are situated on earth.  To understand the
support of these earths, the words "ghanāmbu, vāta, etc." are used. Dense water,
wind, and space are the supports of these earths. Therefore, they are called
"ghanāmbu vāta ākāśa pratiṣṭhāḥ". All these earths are supported by the dense
ocean ring. The dense ocean ring is supported by the dense wind ring. The dense
wind ring is supported by the thin wind ring.

[151 -3118368 ] The third chapter is about the Tanuvatavalaya, which is
supported by the Akasha. The Akasha is self-supported, as it is both the base
and the supported. These three Valayas are each twenty thousand yojanas thick.
The word 'Sapta' (seven) is used to negate other numbers. There are only seven
Bhumi, not eight or nine. The word 'Adho'adhah' (below and below) is used to
negate the possibility of them being situated horizontally. 8368. To determine
whether the Narakas reside everywhere in these Bhumi or only in certain places,
the sutra mentions 'Ghanambhu Matakashapratiṣṭhāḥ'. All these Bhumi are
supported by the Ghanodadhivatavalaya. The Ghanodadhivatavalaya is supported by
the Dhanavatavalaya. The Dhanavatavalaya is supported by the Tanuvatavalaya. The
Tanuvatavalaya is supported by the Akasha, and the Akasha is self-supported, as
it is both the base and the supported. These three Valayas are each twenty
thousand yojanas thick. The word 'Sapta' (seven) is used to negate other
numbers. There are only seven Bhumi, not eight or nine. These Bhumi are not
situated horizontally. The word 'Adho'adhah' (below and below) is used to negate
this possibility. Special Note: There are two types of Akasha - Alokaakasha and
Lokakasha. Lokakasha is situated in the middle of Alokaakasha. It is naturally
formed, without beginning or end, and is filled with six substances. It is seven
rajus wide in all directions, from north to south and from below to above. It is
seven rajus wide from east to west. Then, it gradually narrows down to one raju
wide at a height of seven rajus on both sides. Then, it gradually widens to five
rajus wide at a height of ten and a half rajus on both sides. Then, it gradually
narrows down to one raju wide at a height of fourteen rajus on both sides. From
east to west, the shape of the Lokakasha appears like a human standing with both
hands on the hips and legs spread out. The lower part appears like a seat, the
middle part like a border, and the upper part like a crown. It has three parts -
Adholok, Madhyalok, and Urdhvalok. In the middle of Madhyalok is the Meru
mountain, which is one hundred and forty thousand yojanas high. The lower part
of the Meru is Adholok, the upper part is Urdhvalok, and the middle part is
Madhyalok, which is spread out diagonally in straight lines. Madhyalok is also
called Tiryalok because of its diagonal spread. The current sutra discusses
Adholok. It has seven Bhumi, which are situated one below the other, but they
are not touching each other. There is an immeasurable distance of yojanas
between each Bhumi. The names of these Bhumi are given in the sutra in order.
These are their descriptive names. Ghamma, Vansa, Megha, Anjana, Arishta,
Maghavi, and Madhavi are their proper names. The first Bhumi is one hundred and
eighty thousand yojanas thick. The second is thirty-two thousand yojanas thick,
the third is thirty-three thousand yojanas thick, the fourth is twenty-four
thousand yojanas thick, the fifth is twenty thousand yojanas thick, the sixth is
sixteen thousand yojanas thick, and the seventh is eight thousand yojanas thick.
All these seven Bhumi are supported by Ghanodadhi, Dhanavat, Tanuvat, and
Akasha. That is, each Bhumi is supported by Ghanodadhi, Ghanodadhi is supported
by Dhanavat, Dhanavat is supported by Tanuvat, Tanuvat is supported by Akasha,
and Akasha is self-supported. $368. To determine whether the Narakas reside
everywhere in these Bhumi or only in certain places, the next sutra says...

respectively. ||2|| 8 369. In those Ratnaprabha etc. lands, the number of
Narakas is mentioned by this Sutra, respectively. In Ratnaprabha, there are
thirty lakhs Narakas. In Sharkaraprabha, there are twenty-five lakhs Narakas. In
Valukaprabha, there are fifteen lakhs Narakas. In Pankaprabha, there are ten
lakhs Narakas. In Dhumaprabha, there are three lakhs Narakas. In Tamahprabha,
there are five less than one lakh Narakas and in MahaTamahprabha, there are five
Narakas. In Ratnaprabha, there are thirteen Naraka patalas. From there onwards,
in the seventh land, there are two less Naraka patalas. Other details should be
known from Lokanuyoga. $ 370. Now, what is the special feature of the Narakas in
those lands, for that, it is said: In those lands, there are thirty lakhs,
twenty-five lakhs, fifteen lakhs, ten lakhs, three lakhs, five less than one
lakh and five Narakas, respectively. ||2|| 8369. In those Ratnaprabha etc.
lands, the number of Narakas is mentioned by this Sutra, respectively. In
Ratnaprabha, there are thirty lakhs Narakas. In Sharkaraprabha, there are
twenty-five lakhs Narakas. In Valukaprabha, there are fifteen lakhs Narakas. In
Pankaprabha, there are ten lakhs Narakas. In Dhumaprabha, there are three lakhs
Narakas. In Tamahprabha, there are five less than one lakh Narakas and in
MahaTamahprabha, there are five Narakas. In Ratnaprabha, there are thirteen
Naraka patalas. From there onwards, in the seventh land, there are two less
Naraka patalas. Other details should be known from Lokanuyoga. The special
meaning is that the first seven Prithivis have already been mentioned. Out of
them, the first Prithvi has three parts - Kharbhaga, Pankabhaga and Abbahul
bhaga. Khar bhaga is the topmost. It has abundance of gems and is sixteen
thousand yojanas thick. The second is Pankabhaga, its thickness is eighty-four
thousand yojanas! And the third is Abbahul bhaga. Its thickness is eighty
thousand yojanas. The dwelling places of the Narakis are called Narakas. In the
first and second parts of Ratnaprabha land, there are no Narakas. They are in
the third part. In this way, in the third part of the first land and in the
remaining six lands, as much thickness as has been mentioned, leaving one
thousand yojanas of land above and below, there are Narakas in the remaining
middle part of all the seven lands. Their shape is of various types. Some are
round, some are triangular, some are square and some are of uncertain shape. All
these Naraka patalas are situated in order. Just as one layer of stone or soil
is situated on another layer, in the same way, these patalas are. In the first
land, these patalas are thirteen and in the subsequent lands, two patalas are
less in order. One patala is attached to another patala. In these, there are
Narakas. Naraka is the name of a well-like hole inside the earth. It is
surrounded by earth on all sides, above and below. In these Narakas, the Naraki
beings stay till the end of their life and suffer various kinds of pain there.
8370 To explain the special feature of the Narakis living in those lands, now
the Sutra is said: - Saptamya Dwan Hoon Narak A. Di. 1, Di. 2. 2. - Prastara
Heenaah. Itaro A. Di. 1. Di. 2. 2. Lokaniyogato Di. 1, Di. 2.

## Hell-beings are constantly characterized by the worst karmic tendencies,
their consequences, bodies, pain, and transformations. || 3 ||  8371. The karmic
tendencies and their consequences have been explained before. The term "worst"
indicates that these karmic tendencies are worse than those experienced by
beings in the animal realm, and they are progressively worse in each lower
realm. The word "constant" refers to the continuous nature of these karmic
tendencies. Hell-beings are constantly characterized by the worst karmic
tendencies, their consequences, bodies, pain, and transformations. For example,
in the first and second realms, the karmic tendency is "pigeon-like" (kapotika).
In the third realm, the karmic tendency is "pigeon-like" in the upper part and
"blue" (nila) in the lower part. In the fourth realm, the karmic tendency is
"blue". In the fifth realm, the karmic tendency is "blue" in the upper part and
"black" (krishna) in the lower part. In the sixth realm, the karmic tendency is
"black". And in the seventh realm, the karmic tendency is "supremely black"
(paramkrishna). These karmic tendencies are called "material" (dravya) and
remain constant throughout their lifespan. However, the "mental" (bhaava) karmic
tendencies change every moment. The consequences of these karmic tendencies are
the five senses: touch, taste, smell, sight, and sound. These consequences are
caused by specific karmic fields and are extremely painful, making them the
worst. The bodies of hell-beings are extremely deformed and ugly due to the
emergence of the "bad name" (ashubha naama) karma. Their bodies are distorted,
resembling a "hump" (hunda), and are difficult to look at. Their height in the
first realm is seven bows, three hands, and six fingers. In each lower realm,
their height doubles. Due to the emergence of the "unbearable" (asataavedaniya)
karma within them, hell-beings experience intense pain caused by external
factors like heat and cold, which have been present since time immemorial. In
the first, second, third, and fourth realms, the hell-beings experience only
heat-related pain. In the fifth realm, the upper two hundred thousand hells
experience heat-related pain, while the lower one hundred thousand hells
experience cold-related pain. In the sixth and seventh realms, the hell-beings
experience only cold-related pain. Hell-beings think, "We will do good deeds,"
but they continue to perform the worst actions. They think, "We will create
causes for happiness," but they only create causes for suffering.

## 154] Sarvarthasiddhi  [314 8372 They produce suffering only because of the
cause of suffering. These beings should be known as increasingly inauspicious,
one after the other. 6372.  Because the suffering of these hell beings is caused
by heat and cold, and also in other ways, the following sutra explains:  **They
are afflicted by suffering produced by each other. ||4||**  F373. How is
suffering produced by each other? Hell beings, due to their knowledge of the
cycle of births and deaths, have a false perception of reality, which is called
"vibhanga" (disintegration) knowledge. Because of this knowledge, they
understand the causes of suffering from afar and experience suffering. When they
come closer, they see each other and their anger flares up.  Remembering their
past lives, their hatred intensifies.  Like dogs and jackals, they attack each
other.  They create weapons from their own actions, such as swords, daggers,
axes, arrows, bows, tomars (a specific type of weapon), spears, and hammers.
They inflict intense suffering on each other by piercing, cutting, chopping, and
biting with these weapons and their own hands, feet, and teeth.  8374. Are these
the only causes of suffering, or are there others? The following sutra explains:
**They are also afflicted by suffering produced by the afflicted Asuras, up to
the fourth bhumi. ||5||**  **Note:** The commentary here explains that the
"leshya" (subtle body) changes within a moment, with two different types of
"leshya" being mentioned.  This means that the "leshya" itself doesn't change,
but rather its intensity changes according to the "yoga" (spiritual practice)
and "kṣaya" (passions).  This is because there is no rule that every hell being
must have the same "yoga" and "kṣaya."  However, according to their lower,
middle, or higher time periods, or according to their substance, field, and
state, their "yoga" and "kṣaya" change according to a rule.  Since "leshya" is
the name for the tendency of "yoga" influenced by "kṣaya," it also changes
within its own limits as "yoga" and "kṣaya" change.  Only where the "kapota"
(pigeon) "leshya" is mentioned as the lowest level, it remains the same.  It
doesn't change into the middle or higher level of "kapota" "leshya."  Similarly,
where the "param kṛṣṇa" (supreme black) "leshya" is mentioned, it remains the
same and doesn't change into another "leshya."  The rest of the explanation is
straightforward.  6372. The following sutra explains whether the suffering of
these hell beings is only caused by heat and cold, or if there are other types
of suffering:  **They are also afflicted by suffering produced by each other.
||4||**  8373. The question arises: How do hell beings inflict suffering on each
other? The answer is that hell beings have knowledge of the cycle of births and
deaths, which is called "vibhanga" (disintegration) knowledge, arising from
false perception.  Due to this knowledge, they understand the causes of
suffering from afar and experience suffering.  When they come closer, they see
each other and their anger flares up.  Remembering their past lives, their
hatred intensifies.  Like dogs and jackals, they attack each other.  They create
weapons from their own actions, such as swords, daggers, axes, arrows, bows,
tomars (a specific type of weapon), spears, and hammers.  They inflict intense
suffering on each other by piercing, cutting, chopping, and biting with these
weapons and their own hands, feet, and teeth.  5374. The following sutra
explains whether these are the only causes of suffering, or if there are others:
**They are also afflicted by suffering produced by the afflicted Asuras, up to
the fourth bhumi. ||5||**  **Note:**  "Nārakāṇam?" means "Hell beings?"
"Bhavamu" means "cycle of births and deaths," "Tā" means "they," and "Nā" means
"no."

-316 $ 376] Chapter Three [155 6375. The *asuras* who throw others
(paranitayasuras) are those who have the *karma* called *devagati* and
*namakarma*. Due to the intense suffering they experienced in their previous
birth, they have accumulated *papakarma* (negative karma) which, upon its
fruition, causes them constant suffering. They are called *san-klishta*
(afflicted) *asuras*. The epithet *san-klishta* does not imply that all *asuras*
inflict suffering on the inhabitants of hell. Who then? Only some, like
*Ambavareesha* and others. The epithet "prior to the fourth" is used to indicate
the extent of the *avadhi* (clairvoyance). This is to show that the *san-
klishta* *asuras* are the cause of suffering only in the first three earths, not
beyond. The "c" (cha) in the sutra is used to indicate the collection of the
aforementioned causes of suffering. They inflict suffering on the inhabitants of
hell by means such as feeding them molten iron, embracing them with red-hot iron
pillars, making them climb and descend the *Kuta* *Shalmali* tree, striking them
with iron hammers, cutting them with knives and swords, pouring hot oil on them,
cooking them in oil, roasting them in a pot, immersing them in the *Vaitarani*
river, crushing them with a machine, etc. Even when their bodies are dismembered
by cutting, piercing, etc., they do not die prematurely. Why? Because their
lifespan is not diminished. 6376. If this is so, then tell us the lifespan of
the inhabitants of hell. To this, the sutra says: The lifespan of beings in hell
is, in order of their superior status, one, three, seven, fifteen, seventeen,
twenty-two, and thirty *sagaropama* (ocean-like). ||6|| 8375. In the *namakarma*
called *devagati*, there is a *namakarma* called *asura* which, upon its
fruition, causes the *paranitayasuras* to throw others. Due to the intense
suffering they experienced in their previous birth, they have accumulated
*papakarma* (negative karma) which, upon its fruition, causes them constant
suffering. They are called *san-klishta* (afflicted) *asuras*. The sutra,
although it uses the epithet *san-klishta* for *asuras*, does not imply that all
*asuras* inflict suffering on the inhabitants of hell. Only some, like
*Ambavareesha* and others, inflict suffering. The epithet "prior to the fourth"
is used to indicate the extent of the *avadhi* (clairvoyance). This is to show
that the *san-klishta* *asuras* are the cause of suffering only in the first
three earths, not beyond. The "c" (cha) in the sutra is used to indicate the

immersing them in the *Vaitarani* river, crushing them with a machine, etc. Even
when their bodies are dismembered by cutting, piercing, etc., they do not die
prematurely. Why? Because their lifespan is not diminished. Special Note: The
inhabitants of hell are inherently cruel. They become enraged at the sight of
each other and begin to kill and maim each other. Their bodies are *vaikriyika*
(changeable), so they can assume the form of various weapons and other things to
inflict pain on other inhabitants of hell. Even the gods can go to the third
hell, so these *asuras* also provoke them into fighting each other and take
pleasure in watching them kill each other. However, not all gods do this, but
only some *asura* *kumara* gods, like *Ambavareesha* and others. Even though all
this happens, the inhabitants of hell do not die prematurely. This is something
important to know. 6376. If this is so, then tell us the lifespan of the
inhabitants of hell. To this, the sutra says: The lifespan of beings in hell is,
in order of their superior status, one, three, seven, fifteen, seventeen,
twenty-two, and thirty *sagaropama* (ocean-like). ||6|| 1. *Sammani* *Sam-

## Chapter Three  **8381.** The phrase "द्विद्वि" indicates that the diameters
of the islands and oceans are doubled. The diameter of the first island is
doubled to form the diameter of the salt ocean. The diameter of the salt ocean
is doubled to form the diameter of the second island. The diameter of the second
island is doubled to form the diameter of the second ocean. Thus, the diameters
of all these islands and oceans are doubled. The phrase "पूर्वपूर्व परिक्षेपिण:"
indicates that they are arranged like villages and cities, one surrounding the
other. The phrase "वलयाकृतय:" indicates that they are not square or any other
shape.  **8382.** Now, the diameter of Jambudvipa, the first island, must be
described, because the diameters of the other islands and oceans are derived
from it. Therefore, the next verse says:  **8383.** In the middle of all these,
there is Jambudvipa, which is circular, has a diameter of one hundred thousand
yojanas, and has Mount Meru at its center.  **Explanation:** The word "तन्मध्ये"
means "in the middle of them." The question arises: "In the middle of whom?" The
answer is: "In the middle of the aforementioned islands and oceans." Mount Meru
is called "naabhi" because it is located at the center, which is the meaning of
"naabhi." This means that Jambudvipa is circular, has a diameter of one hundred
thousand yojanas, and has Mount Meru at its center. The question arises: "Why is
it called Jambudvipa?" The answer is: "It is called Jambudvipa because it is
associated with the Jambudvipa tree." In Uttarakuru, there is a Jambudvipa tree,
which is eternal, made of earth, natural, and surrounded by other trees. This
island is named after that tree.  **Note:** We have discussed the lower world.
Next, we will discuss the middle world.

## 1581 Sarvarthasiddhi  **[3110.8 3845 384.  There, in Jambudvipa, there are
seven regions divided by six Kulaparvatas. What are they? This is explained
further:**  **Bharatavarsha, Haimavatavarsha, Harivarsha, Videhavarsha,
Ramyakavarsha, Hairanyavata Varsha and Airavatavarsha are the seven regions.
||10||**  **[8385. The names of the regions, like Bharat, etc., have been in
existence since time immemorial and are without any specific cause. Where is
Bharatavarsha located?  Bharatavarsha is located in the south of the Himavan
mountain, between the three oceans, shaped like a raised bow. It is divided into
six parts by the Vijaya, Ganga and Sindhu rivers.  Haimavatavarsha is located to
the north of the Ksudra Himavan, to the south of the Mahahimavan, and between
the eastern and western oceans. Harivarsha is located to the south of Nishdha,
to the north of the Mahahimavan, and between the eastern and western oceans.
Videhavarsha is located to the north of Nishdha, to the south of Nila, and
between the eastern and western oceans. Ramyakavarsha is located to the north of
Nila, to the south of Rukmina, and between the eastern and western oceans.
Rukmina is located to the north of Shikhraprithvi, in the upper part.  There are
countless islands and oceans, one after another, in a circular shape.
Jambudvipa is located in the middle of all these.  There is no other island or
ocean between it and the others.  Although all the islands and oceans are
circular, they are all circular like a bead, while this one is circular like a
plate.  Its diameter is one lakh yojanas.  In the exact middle of it is Mount
Meru.  It is one lakh forty thousand yojanas high.  One thousand yojanas of it
are underground.  The peak is at forty yojanas, and the remaining ninety-nine
thousand yojanas are from the flat surface to the peak.  The diameter of Mount
Meru at the base is ten thousand yojanas.  It gradually decreases as it goes up.
The diameter of the base increases in the same proportion as it decreases at the
top.  Mount Meru has three sections.  The first section is five hundred yojanas
from the ground, the second is sixty-two thousand five hundred yojanas, and the
third is thirty-six thousand yojanas.  There is a cut at the end of each
section.  The diameter of one side of the cut is five hundred yojanas.  The
diameter of the last cut is only six yojanas less.  It is adorned with four
forests, one on the ground and three on these three cuts.  Their names are
Bhadra, Nandana, Saumanasa and Panduka, in order.  After the first and second
cuts, Mount Meru goes straight up, and then it starts to decrease gradually.
There are sixteen Chaityalayas in each of the four forests, four in each
direction.  In the Panduka forest, there are four Panduka stones in each
direction, on which the Tirthankaras born in that region are anointed.  Its
color is yellow. ]**

-3112 8388] Chapter Three [159 The Hairanyavata region is situated between the
western sea and the eastern and western seas, with Rukmi to the north and
Shikhari to the south. The Airavata region is situated to the north of Shikhari
and between the three seas, divided into six parts by Vijayardhana and Rakta
Raktoda. 8386. It has been said that there are six Kulaparvatas. Who are they
and how are they arranged? To answer this, the following verse says: The six
Kulaparvatas, which divide the regions, are Himavan, Mahahimavan, Nishadha,
Nila, Rukmi, and Shikhari, extending from east to west. ||1|| 8387. These
mountains are called Vibhajin because they divide the regions. The phrase
"extending from east to west" means that they touch the salt sea with their
eastern and western ends. Himavan and the others are names that have been in use
since time immemorial and are without any specific reason. They are called
Varshadhara Parvatas because they are responsible for the division of the
regions. Where is Himavan? It is situated on the border of the Bharat and
Haimavata regions. It is also called Kshudra Himavan and is one hundred yojanas
high. Mahahimavan, which divides the Haimavata and Hari Varsha regions, is two
hundred yojanas high. Nishadha, which is to the south of Videha and to the north
of Hari Varsha, is four hundred yojanas high. The other three mountains, which
divide their respective regions, should be understood in the same way. Their
heights are four hundred, two hundred, and one hundred yojanas respectively. The
depth of all these mountains is one-fourth of their height. 8 388. The following
verse describes the specific colors of these mountains: These six mountains are
respectively the color of gold, silver, heated gold, vaidurya gem, silver, and
gold. ||12|| 1. Sannivesho Hair- Mu. 2. -Vibhaktah Shat- Mu. 3. Simanyava- A.,

## 160] **Sarvarthasiddhi** [3112 § 389 8389. These mountains, starting with
Himavat, should be known by their colors in order. Himavat is *hemamaya*, the
color of Chinese silk. Mahahimat is *arjunamaya*, white. Nishadha is
*tapaniyamaya*, the color of heated gold, like the rising sun. Nila is
*vaiduryamaya*, the color of lapis lazuli, like a peacock's neck. Rukmi is
*rajatamaya*, white. Shikhara is *hemamaya*, the color of Chinese silk. 8390. To
further describe these mountains, the next sutra says: **Their sides are adorned
with various jewels, and they are of equal width at the top, middle, and base.**
||13|| $ 391. These mountains have sides adorned with various jewels, possessing
different colors, radiance, and other qualities. Therefore, they are called
*mani-vichitra-parva*. The words "upari" etc. are used to eliminate the
possibility of an undesirable shape. The word "cha" indicates the inclusion of
the middle. The meaning is that their width at the base is the same as at the
top and middle. 8392. The next sutra describes the lakes found in the middle of
these mountains: **On top of them are, in order, the lakes Padma, Mahapadma,
Tiginchha, Kesari, Mahapuṇḍarīka, and Puṇḍarīka.** ||14|| 8393. These six lakes,
Padma, Mahapadma, Tiginchha, Kesari, Mahapuṇḍarīka, and Puṇḍarīka, should be
known in order, on top of Himavat and the other mountains. $ 394. To describe
the specific shape of the first lake, the next sutra says: 1.
*tadvisheshpratipattyarthamaha* mu. 2. -*shtasya samstha-* mu.

-3118 § 401] Chapter Three The first lake is one thousand yojanas long and half
that width. ||15|| $ 395. The Padma lake is one thousand yojanas long from east
to west and five hundred yojanas wide from north to south. Its bottom is made of
vajra and its banks are adorned with various jewels and gold. 8396. To explain
the depth, this sutra is said: It is ten yojanas deep. ||16|| 8397. Avagaha,
adha pravesha, and nimnata are synonyms. The depth of the Padma lake is ten
yojanas, this is the meaning of the sutra. 8398. What is in the middle of it?
There is a lotus of one yojana in the middle of it. ||17|| 8399. The word
'yojana' in the sutra should be taken as one yojana. The meaning is that the
lotus leaf is one krośa long and its stalk is two krośas wide, therefore the
lotus is one yojana long and one yojana wide. The stalk of this lotus rises two
krośas above the water level and its leaves are of the same thickness. This is
how the lotus should be understood. 8400. Now, to explain the length etc. of
other lakes and lotuses, the following sutra is said: -  The next lakes and
lotuses are double in size. ||18|| § 401. The word 'tat' in the sutra refers to
both the lake and the lotus. The sutra says 'tadvigunadviguna' to indicate that
the next lakes and lotuses are double in size. Question - Double in comparison
to what? Answer - In comparison to the length etc. 1.   gaha. tanmadhye yojanam

[163  3122 $ 408] Chapter Three: The Middle of the Fields, the Middle of That
Middle. Those that go through the middle of that middle are called *Tन्मध्यगाः*.
All of them are brought together in one place to eliminate the possibility of
confusion and to understand the specific direction. From two pairs, the first
ones are the ones that go east. ||21|| 8406. The phrase "from two pairs" implies
that each pair of rivers is in one field, thus eliminating the possibility of
all the rivers being in one place. The phrase "the first ones are the ones that
go east" is meant to understand the specific direction. The rivers that are
first are the ones that go east. They go east because they go to the eastern
ocean. What is the basis for this eastward direction? It is based on the
instructions given in the sutra. If this is the case, then the Ganga, Sindhu,
and the other seven rivers would be the ones that go east. This is not a problem
because the phrase "from two pairs" is relevant. We should understand that from
each pair of rivers, the first one flows east and joins the eastern ocean. 8407.
Now, to understand the specific direction of the other rivers, we say: The rest
go west. ||22|| 8408. The remaining rivers from each pair should be understood
as the ones that go west. They are called *अपरगाः* because they go to the
western ocean. Among them, the Ganga originates from the Padma lake and exits
from the eastern gate. The Sindhu originates from the western gate. The
Rohitasya originates from the northern gate. The Rohit originates from the
Mahapadma lake and exits from the southern gate. The Harikanta originates from
the northern gate. The Harit originates from the Tiginchha lake and exits from
the southern gate. The Sitoda originates from the northern gate. The Kesari
originates from the Kesari lake and exits from the southern gate. 1. *मध्यं

## 164] **Sarvarthasiddhi** -3123 § 412] Sotoba. The Sita river originates from
the Kesarihava Prabhava and exits from the Avachya Torana door. The Narakanta
river originates from the Udicya Torana door. The Nari river originates from the
Mahapuṇḍarīka Prabhava and exits from the Dakṣiṇa Torana door. The Rūpyakūla
river originates from the Udicya Torana door. The Suvarṇakūla river originates
from the Puṇḍarīka Prabhava and exits from the Avachya Torana door. The Rakta
river originates from the Purva Torana door and the Raktoda river originates
from the Prativyā Torana door. 8409. To explain the families of these rivers,
the following sutra is stated: The Ganga, Sindhu, and other rivers have fourteen
thousand families each. || 23 || 8410. Why is the term "Ganga, Sindhu, etc."
used? It is used to include all rivers. Are these rivers already included in the
previous discussion? This is not a valid concern, because according to the rule
"the subsequent statement is either a regulation or a prohibition," only the
rivers flowing westward would be included, which is not desirable. Therefore,
the term "Ganga, Sindhu, etc." is used in the sutra. If only the term "Ganga,
etc." was used, then only the rivers flowing eastward would be included, which
is also not desirable. Therefore, the term "Ganga, Sindhu, etc." is used to
include both types of rivers. Although the term "Ganga, Sindhu, etc." itself
implies that these are rivers, the term "river" is used in the sutra to connect
it with the phrase "twice, twice." The Ganga has fourteen thousand family
rivers. Similarly, the Sindhu also has fourteen thousand family rivers. In this
way, the family rivers further north are twice as many as the previous ones, up
to Videha. Beyond Videha, the family rivers are half as many. $ 411. To explain
the extent of these regions, the following sutra is stated: The Bharat region is
five hundred twenty-six yojanas wide, plus six nineteenths of a yojana. || 25 ||
$ 412. Here, the phrase "five hundred twenty-six yojanas wide" is compounded in
the commentary. 1. Apara Torana - Mu. 1 2. Pa. Ma. Bha., p. 335 3. Region twice,
twice - Mu. 14. - more than those - Mu.

-3127 § 418] Chapter Three [165 Bharatavarsha is five hundred and twenty-six
yojanas in extent. Is this its only extent? No, because one should add six-
nineteenths of a yojana to its extent. § 413. To understand the specific
diameters of the other regions, the following sutra is stated: The regions from
Varshadhara to Videha are twice and twice the extent of Bharatavarsha. ||25||
8414. 'Those whose extent is twice and twice that of Bharatavarsha are these,
those whose extent is twice and twice that of Bharatavarsha. Which are they?
Varshadhara and the regions up to Videha. Are all of them? No, because it is
said, 'Videhaanta'. § 415. To explain how the northern regions are, the
following sutra is stated: The northern regions are equal to the southern
regions. ||26|| § 416. The northern regions, from Airawata to Nila, should be
considered equal to the southern regions, from Bharatavarsha onwards. This
peculiarity should be understood in all that has been said before. From this,
the equality of the lakes and lotuses etc. should be inferred. § 417. Here, the
questioner asks: In these aforementioned regions, from Bharatavarsha onwards, is
the experience of humans etc. the same, or is there some difference? To answer
this question, the following sutra is stated: In Bharatavarsha and Airawata,
there is increase and decrease in accordance with the six periods of Utsarpini
and Avasarpini. ||27|| § 418. In both the words 'vṛddhi' and 'hrasha', there is
a karmadharaya compound. Question: In accordance with what? 1. 'Tato dviguṇo tā,
nā.' 2. 'Tulyo'nubhavaḥ āho- tā., nā.' 3. '-yābhyām.' Kayoḥ mu.

## Chapter Three  [§ 422] The duration of the Utsarpini is twenty-one thousand
years. The Avasarpini should be understood in the reverse order. [§ 419] Now, to
explain the state of other lands, the following Sutra is stated: "The remaining
lands are situated apart from these two." [28] [§ 420] The Sutra uses the word
"Taabhyaam" to refer to the Bharata and Airavata regions. The remaining lands
are situated apart from these two. There is no Utsarpini or Avasarpini time in
those regions. [§ 421] Now, to explain whether the humans in these lands have
equal lifespans or have some special characteristics, the following Sutra is
stated: "The humans in the Haimvata, Harivarsha, and Daivakuru regions have
lifespans of one, two, and three Palya-upamas respectively." [29] [§ 422] Those
born in the Haimvata region are called Haimvatakas. Here, the word "Haimvata" is
suffixed with the "Vun" suffix to form the word "Haimvataka," which signifies
humans. Similarly, the words "Harivarshaka" and "Daivakuruka" should be
understood in the same way. There are three Haimvatakas, etc., and three Ekas,
etc. Here, their connection is made in order, which means that the humans in the
Haimvata region have a lifespan of one Palya-upamas. The humans in the
Harivarsha region have a lifespan of two Palya-upamas, and the humans in the
Daivakuru region have a lifespan of three Palya-upamas. In the two and a half
islands, there are five Haimvata regions where there is always Sushma. There,
the humans have a lifespan of one Palya-upamas, a height of two thousand Dhanus,
their food is taken at intervals of one day, and their body color is like a blue
lotus. In the five Harivarsha regions, there is always Sushma time. There, the
humans have a lifespan of two Palya-upamas, a height of four thousand Dhanus,
their food is taken at intervals of two days, and their body color is white like
a conch shell. In the five Daivakuru regions, there is always Sushmasushma time.
There, the humans have a lifespan of three Palya-upamas, a height of six
thousand Dhanus, their food is taken at intervals of three...

## Chapter Three  **169. Description:** The description is the same as before.
It has been said that the Jambudvipa is surrounded by a Vedika. Beyond that is
the Lavanasamudra, a sea with a circumference of two hundred thousand yojanas.
Beyond that is the Dhaataki-khanda, an island with a circumference of four
hundred thousand yojanas.  **8429. To understand the number of years, etc., the
following sutra is given:**  The Dhaataki-khanda has twice the number of regions
and mountains, etc., as the Jambudvipa. ||33||  **8430.** The repetition of the
regions like Bharat, etc., is intended here.  **Question:** Why is the suffix
"suc" used in the sutra?  **Answer:** The suffix "suc" is used to indicate the
repetition of the action that is being added to the sentence. For example, in
the sentence "This palace is twice as big," the suffix "suc" indicates that the
palace is two-storied. Similarly, in the Dhaataki-khanda, the suffix "suc"
indicates that the regions like Bharat, etc., are twice as big.
**Explanation:** The Dhaataki-khanda is divided into two parts, the eastern
Dhaataki-khanda and the western Dhaataki-khanda, by two mountains called
Ishvaakara, which are shaped like arrows and touch the Lavanasamudra and the
Kalodaka at their ends. These mountains run from south to north. In the middle
of these two parts, there are two Mandaras, or Meru mountains. On both sides of
these Mandaras are the regions like Bharat, etc., and the mountains like
Himavan, etc. Thus, the number of regions and mountains in the Dhaataki-khanda
is twice that of the Jambudvipa. For example, there are two Bharats, two
Himavans, etc. The circumference of the Himavan, etc., in the Dhaataki-khanda is
twice that of the Jambudvipa. These mountains are situated in the middle of the
regions, like the spokes of a wheel. The regions are shaped like the holes in a
wheel. In the Jambudvipa, there is a Jambudvipa tree. In the Dhaataki-khanda,
there is a Dhaataki tree with its family of trees. The island is named Dhaataki-
khanda because of this tree. The Kalodaka sea surrounds this island. Its shore
looks as if it has been cut by a tank. The extent of the Bharat region is one-
eighth of the total extent of the Dhaataki-khanda, which is five hundred twenty-
six and six-nineteenths yojanas.

Sarvarthasiddhi [3134 The circumference of the Kalodaka is 431,000 yojanas. The
Pushkaradvipa, surrounded by the Kalodaka, has a circumference of 1,600,000
yojanas. 8431. In this context, the size of the Dvipa and the oceans is doubled
progressively. Similarly, the size of the Dhataki-khanda, the Dvipa, and other
regions is doubled. To clarify this, the following sutra is stated: "There are
the same number of regions and mountains in Pushkarardha." ||34|| 8432. Here,
the word "dvi" is repeated. Question: To what is this repetition of "dvi"
referring? Answer: It is referring to the Jambudvipa, Bharata, Himavan, and
other regions and mountains. Question: How is this understood? Answer: From the
explanation. Just as the size of the Himavan and other mountains in the Dhataki-
khanda is stated, so too is the size of the Himavan and other mountains in
Pushkarardha doubled. The names are the same. There are two Isvakara and two
Mandara mountains, as before. Where there is the Jambudvipa, there is the
Pushkaradvipa with its family of trees. Therefore, the name of this Dvipa is
established as Pushkaradvipa. Question: How did this Dvipa get the name
Pushkarardha? Answer: Due to the division of the Dvipa by the Manushottara
mountain, half of the Dvipa is called Pushkarardha. 8433. Here, the questioner
asks: Why is the number of the Himavan and other mountains in the Jambudvipa
doubled in Pushkarardha, and not in the entire Pushkaradvipa? To answer this
question, the following sutra is stated: "Humans are only present before the
Manushottara mountain." ||35|| 8434. In the exact middle of the Pushkaradvipa,
there is a circular mountain called Manushottara, like a peak. Humans are only
present before this mountain, not beyond it. Therefore, there is no division of
the regions mentioned earlier beyond the Manushottara mountain. There are no
Vidyadharas beyond this mountain, and   1. -pekshayav. Jambudvipatpushkarardhe

[171  -3136 6 435] Chapter Three: Even those humans who have attained **riddhi**
(spiritual power) go elsewhere, except for those born in **upapada** (a specific
region) or those who have attained **samudghāta** (a specific spiritual state).
Therefore, this name **Mānuṣottara** (above humans) is meaningful. In this way,
humans should be known in the **Jambūdvīpa** (a mythical island) and the two and
a half other islands, and in the two oceans. They are of two types: **Ārya**
(noble) and **Mleccha** (non-noble). ||36|| 8435. Those who are considered by
qualities or by those who possess qualities are called **Ārya**. They are of two
types: **riddhi-prāpta Ārya** (Ārya who have attained **riddhi**) and **anṛddhi-
prāpta Ārya** (Ārya who have not attained **riddhi**). **Anṛddhi-prāpta Ārya**
are of five types: **kṣetra-ārya** (Ārya by virtue of their land), **jāti-ārya**
(Ārya by virtue of their birth), **karma-ārya** (Ārya by virtue of their
actions), **cāritra-ārya** (Ārya by virtue of their conduct), and **darśana-
ārya** (Ārya by virtue of their vision). **Riddhi-prāpta Ārya** are of seven
types, based on the difference in **buddhi** (intelligence), **vikriyā**
(action), **tapa** (austerity), **bala** (strength), **auṣadha** (medicine),
**rasa** (taste), and **akṣīṇa** (imperishable) **riddhi**. **Mleccha** are of
two types: **antarvīpa-ja** (born in the **antarvīpa** (inner islands)) and
**karma-bhūmi-ja** (born in the **karma-bhūmi** (land of karma)). There are
eight **antarvīpa** in each of the eight directions within the **lavaṇa-
udhadha** (salt ocean). And there are eight more **antarvīpa** in between them.
There are eight **antarvīpa** at the ends of both the **himavan** (Himalayan)
and **śikhari** (peak) mountains, and at the ends of both the **vijaya-ardha**
(victorious half) mountains. Of these, the islands in the directions are located
500 **yojanas** (a unit of distance) away from the **vedikā** (a specific
location). And the islands in between them are located 500 **yojanas** away from
the **vidiś** (a specific location). There is no division of **śailākā** (a
specific type of mountain). Except for those born in **upapada** on that side of
this mountain and those who have attained **samudghāta**, no other
**vidyadhara** (celestial beings) or **riddhi-prāpta muni** (saints who have
attained **riddhi**) go there. Therefore, this name **Mānuṣottara** (above
humans) is meaningful for this mountain. In this way, humans should be known in
the **Jambūdvīpa** (a mythical island) and the two and a half other islands, and
in the two oceans.

## Translation:  [172] **Sarvarthasiddhi 288** [3136 § 435  The islands within
the six yojanas are called **Antardvipas**. The islands within the hundred
yojanas are called **Vibhu**. The islands within the **Visvantar** are half the
size of the **Vibhu**. The islands within the **Shailantas** are twenty-five
yojanas in extent.   In the east, there are people with one leg (**Ekoruka**).
In the west, there are people with tails (**Langulin**). In the north, there are
people who are mute (**Visyabhashaka**). In the south, there are people with
horns (**Visanin**). In the four cardinal directions, there are people with ears
like a rabbit (**Sashakarnasaskuli**), fish (**Saskuli**), a shield
(**Pravarana**), and long ears (**Lambakarna**). In the eight intervals, there
are people with faces like a horse (**Ashva**), lion (**Simha**), dog
(**Kaka**), buffalo (**Mahisha**), boar (**Varaha**), tiger (**Vyagra**), crow
(**Kaka**), and monkey (**Kapi**). In the two ends of the **Shikhari** mountain,
there are people with faces like a cloud (**Megha**) and lightning (**Vidyun**).
In the two ends of the **Himavat** mountain, there are people with faces like a
fish (**Matsya**) and time (**Kala**). In the two ends of the **Uttara
Vijayardha**, there are people with faces like an elephant (**Hasti**) and a
mirror (**Adarsa**). In the two ends of the **Dakshina Vijayardha**, there are
people with faces like a cow (**Go**), and a ram (**Mesha**).  The **Ekoruka**
are earth-eaters and live in caves. The rest are flower and fruit eaters and
live in trees. All of them have a lifespan of one **Palyopam**. These twenty-
four **Antardvipas** are one yojana high above the surface of the water.
Similarly, there are twenty-four **Antardvipas** in the **Kalod** ocean. These
are all **Antardvipaj Mlechchas**.   Apart from these, the **Shaka**,
**Yavana**, **Shabara**, **Pulinda**, etc. are **Karmabhumij Mlechchas**.
**Special Note:** The **Shatkhandagama** classifies humans into two categories:
**Karmabhumij** and **Akarmabhumij**. **Akarmabhumij** is another name for
**Bhogabhumika**. One type of **Bhogabhumika** is **Kubhogabhumika**. The people
born in **Kubhogabhumika** are called **Antardvipaj Mlechchas**. The rest, like
the **Shaka**, **Yavana**, **Shabara**, **Pulinda**, etc. are **Karmabhumij
Mlechchas**. Similarly, Aryans are also divided into two categories based on
their region.  2. - णस्यां विषा दि. 1. उत्तरस्यामभाषका आ. दि. 1, दि. 2 1 1, दि.

## Chapter Three  [3137 8 437] Chapter Three [173 $ 436. What are the
Karmabhoomis? Now, to explain this, it is said: Bharata, Airavata, and Videha
are the Karmabhoomis, excluding Devakuru and Uttarakuru. ||37|| 8437. Bharata,
Airavata, and Videha, each five in number, are called Karmabhoomis. The
inclusion of 'Videha' implies the inclusion of Devakuru and Uttarakuru, hence to
negate that, it is said, "excluding Devakuru and Uttarakuru." The word
'excluding' signifies negation. Devakuru, Uttarakuru, Haimavat, Harivarsha,
Ramyak, Hairanyavat, and Antarvipa are called Bhogabhoomis. Now, how do they
become Karmabhoomis? Because they are the abode of auspicious and inauspicious
Karmas. But, all three realms are the abode of Karma. Therefore, it is
understood that these are the abode of Karma in a superior way. Now, the
acquisition of inauspicious Karma, which leads to the seven Narakas, happens
only in Bharata and other such realms. Similarly, the acquisition of auspicious
Karma, which leads to the attainment of special places like Sarvarthasiddhi,
also happens here. And, the initiation of six types of Karma, like agriculture,
along with the giving of gifts, happens here, hence Bharata and other such
realms should be known as Karmabhoomis. Other realms are primarily concerned
with the enjoyment of the fruits of ten types of Kalpavriksha, hence they are
called Bhogabhoomis.  There are two types of Aryas: Karmabhoomi Aryas and
Akarmabhoomi Aryas. Those who live in the Bhogabhoomis are Akarmabhoomi Aryas,
and those who live in the Karmabhoomis are Karmabhoomi Aryas. Akarmabhoomi Aryas
and Mlechchas can attain up to four Gunasthanas, but Karmabhoomi Aryas and
Mlechchas are also eligible for Anuvrata and Mahavrata. The detailed explanation
of their Sayamasamyama and Samyama Gunasthanas is given in the Kshaya Prabhruta
Labdhi Saar and Kshapana Saar.  8436. Now, to explain what the Karmabhoomis are,
the next Sutra says: Except for Devakuru and Uttarakuru, Bharata, Airavata, and
Videha are all Karmabhoomis. ||37||  8437. Bharata, Airavata, and Videha, each
five in number, are called Karmabhoomis. The inclusion of 'Videha' implies the
inclusion of Devakuru and Uttarakuru, hence to negate that, the phrase
"excluding Devakuru and Uttarakuru" is used. The word 'excluding' signifies
negation. Devakuru, Uttarakuru, Haimavat, Harivarsha, Ramyak, Hairanyavat, and
Antarvipa are called Bhogabhoomis.  **Question:** How do they become
Karmabhoomis?  **Answer:** The abode of auspicious and inauspicious Karmas is
called Karmabhoomi. Although all three realms are the abode of Karma, these are
the abode of Karma in a superior way. The acquisition of inauspicious Karma,
which leads to the seven Narakas, happens only in Bharata and other such realms.
Similarly, the acquisition of auspicious Karma, which leads to the attainment of
special places like Sarvarthasiddhi, also happens here. And, the initiation of
six types of Karma, like agriculture, along with the giving of gifts, happens
here, hence Bharata and other such realms should be known as Karmabhoomis. Other
realms are primarily concerned with the enjoyment of the fruits of ten types of
Kalpavriksha, hence they are called Bhogabhoomis.  **Note:** It has already been
explained that the division of Bharata and other such realms is only in the two
and a half Dvipas. In Jambudvipa, there is one each of Bharata and other such
realms, and in Dhaatukokhand and Pushkarardha, there are two each. Thus, there
are a total of 35 realms. Even though Uttarakuru and Devakuru are within the
Videha realm, they are counted separately because they have a superior
Bhogabhoomi system. Therefore, when we add the five Devakurus and five
Uttarakurus to the five Videhas, the total number of realms becomes 45. Out of
these, 5 are Bharata, 1. Bharataravatavidehaasch Mu., Ta., Na. 2. Harivansha:

[174] Sarvarthasiddho 8438. In the mentioned lands, for the purpose of
explaining the state of human beings, the state of Ahanrsthiti is explained as
being between the three Palya-upamas and the Antarmuhurta. ||38||. $ 439 Three
Palya-upamas are called Tripalyaopama. The Muhurta within is called
Antarmuhurta. The connection is in order. The superior state of human beings is
Tripalyaopama. The inferior state is Antarmuhurta. There are many variations in
between. There are three types of Palya: Vyavaharapalya, Uddharapalya, and
Adhhapalya. These are meaningful names. The first is called Vyavaharapalya,
because it is the basis of the next two Palya. Nothing else can be measured by
it. The second is Uddharapalya. From the hair removed from Uddharapalya, islands
and oceans are counted. The third is Adhhapalya. Adha and Kalasthiti are
synonymous. The measure of the first is now explained, because it is for the
purpose of explaining it. For example, three Palya are considered skillful,
which are as wide, long, and deep as a Yojana measured by the Angula. The hair
of a ram born in a day and night, from one to seven days, is cut into pieces so
that the second cut cannot be made with scissors. Then, in every hundred years,
one hair is removed. The time taken for that pit to become empty is called
Vyavaharapalyopama. Then, in every hundred years, one hair is removed from the
countless crores of years. The time taken for that pit to become empty is called
Uddharapalyopama. Ten crore crore of these Uddharapalya make one
Uddharasagaropama. As many as  1 5 Videha and 5 Airavata are 15 Karmabhumis and
the remaining 30 are Bhogbhumis. The reason why these are called Karmabhumis and
Bhogbhumis is explained in the original commentary. 8438. The next sutra
explains the knowledge of the state in the mentioned lands: the superior state
of human beings is three Palya-upamas and the inferior state is Antarmuhurta.
||38|| $ 439 'Tripalyaopama' is a Bahuvrihi compound of 'tri' and 'Palyaopama'.
The time within the Muhurta is called Antarmuhurta. These two are connected with
Para and Apara respectively. The superior state of human beings is three Palya-
upamas and the inferior state is Antarmuhurta. The middle state is of many
types. There are three types of Palya: Vyavaharapalya, Uddharapalya, and
Adhhapalya. These are meaningful names. The first is called Vyavaharapalya,
because it is the basis of the next two Palya. Nothing else can be measured by
it. The second is Uddharapalya. From the hair removed from Uddharapalya, islands
and oceans are counted. The third is Adhhapalya. Adha and Kalasthiti are
synonymous. The measure of the first is now explained, because it is for the

The third chapter:  [175] There are as many islands and seas as there are hairs
on a half-uddhara-pallya. A half-uddhara-pallya is filled with hairs that are
cut off in a hundred years. Then, as each hair is removed from the half-uddhara-
pallya, the time it takes for the space to become empty is called an adha-
pallya-upam. Ten kodi-kodi adha-pallyas make one adha-sagara. Ten kodi-kodi
adha-sagaras make one avasarpini. The utsarpini is also the same size.  With
this adha-pallya, the karma-sthiti, bhava-sthiti, ayu-sthiti, and kaya-sthiti of
naraki, tiryanch, deva, and manushya should be calculated. The sangraha-gatha
also says:  "Vyavahar, uddhar, and adha, these three pallyas should be known.
Vyavahar pallya is the cause of the number. The second is used to count the
islands and seas. The third, adha-pallya, is used to account for the karma-
sthiti."  8440. Just as there are these excellent and inferior states of humans,
so too are there the same for tiryanch. [39]  8441. The yoni of tiryanch is
called tiryanch-yoni. This means the birth obtained from the karma-udaya called
tiryanch-gati. Those born in the tiryanch-yoni are called tiryanch-yonija. The
excellent bhava-sthiti of these tiryanch-yonija is three pallya-upam, and the
inferior bhava-sthiti is antarmuhurta. There are many variations in between.
Thus ends the third chapter of the Tattvarthavritti, known as Sarvarth Siddhi.

## 176] **Sarvarthasiddhi** [31398441  The existence of *bhavas* (states of
existence) is proven, because once having obtained a *bhavas* with a *jghanya*
(inferior) lifespan, it is possible to move to another *paryaya* (state). The
superior *kayasthiti* (physical state) of humans is *purvakotiprithaktva*
(separation from the previous *koti*) of more than three *patyopama* (units of
time). *Prithaktva* is a *raudhika* (conventional) term. Primarily, it means
more than three and less than nine. Here, the word *prithaktva* has been used in
a broader sense. The superior *kayasthiti* of *tiryanchas* (animals) is
*anantakal* (infinite time), which is equal to countless *pudgala* (matter)
transformations. This is called their *kayasthiti* in comparison to the general
*tiryanchagati* (animal existence). If a being comes from another *gati* (state
of existence) and continuously wanders in *tiryanchagati*, then it can remain in
*tiryanchagati* for a maximum of this much time. After that, it is born in
another *gati* according to the law. There are many types of *tiryanchas*, so
their *kayasthiti* is different in relation to those types.  Thus, the third
chapter of the *Tattvarthavritti* named *Sarvarthasiddhi* ends. ||3||

## Chapter Four  **8442.** The word "deva" (god) has been used many times in the
sutras, such as "भवप्रत्ययो ऽवधिर्देवनारकाणाम्" (gods and hell-beings have
knowledge of the limit of their bhavas). However, it is not clear who these
devas are and how many types of devas there are. To clarify this, the next sutra
states:  **Devas are of four nikayas (groups).** ||1||  **8443.** Devas are
those who, due to the rise of the karma called "devagati" (god-hood) as an inner
cause, enjoy various external glories and play freely in places like islands,
oceans, etc. The use of the singular "deva" in the sutra is appropriate because
the mention of the genus (jati) implies the mention of the species (bhuta). The
use of the plural is to indicate the various types of devas. The implication is
that there are many types of devas, even more than Indra and Samanika, and there
are also many types in terms of their state, etc. Therefore, the plural is used
to indicate them. Those who are gathered together by the power of the devagati
karma, which is obtained through their own specific karmas, are called nikayas.
The word "nikaya" means "group." The compound "caturnikaya" indicates that there
are four main groups of devas. The question arises: what are the names of these
four nikayas? The answer is: Bhavanavasi, Vyantar, Jyotishka, and Vaimanika.
**8444.** To determine the leshyas (degrees of purity) of these nikayas, the
next sutra states:  **In the first three nikayas, there are four leshyas, up to
the Pita leshya.** ||2||  1. iti va tanni- mu. 5. iti. Jaty- mu. Vishe- mu. Ta.,

## Translation:  **178]** **Sarvarthasiddhi**  [413 8445 8445. 'Adit' is said,
do not understand that the inclusion is at the end, in the middle, or otherwise.
At the beginning, from the beginning. The term 'tri' is used to negate two and
one. Why is it not used to negate four? Because of the word 'Adit'. Six Leshyas
have been mentioned. To include four Leshyas, the term 'Pitaanta' is used. Pita
means Tejas. Those who have Pita at the end are Pitaantas. Those who have
Pitaanta Leshyas are Pitaantaleshyas. This means that in the three Nikayas of
Bhavanvasi, Vyantara, and Jyotish, there are four Leshyas of Krishna, Neel,
Kapota, and Pita for the Devas.  8446. To explain the internal variations of
these Nikayas, it is said: Dashastapanchdwadashavikalpa, Kalpopapannaparyantah
||3||  8447. The four Deva Nikayas are to be understood as being related to the
numbers ten, eight, five, and twelve respectively. Bhavanvasis are of ten types.
Vyantaras are of eight types. Jyotishkas are of five types. Vaimanikas are of
twelve types. Since all Vaimanikas are included in the twelve types, the
qualifier 'Kalpopapannaparyantah' is used to negate Graiveyak etc. How is the
term 'Kalpa' used? Indra etc. are ten types, which are considered in these.
8445. Do not understand that the inclusion is at the end, in the middle, or
otherwise, for the three Nikayas at the end, the Nikayas in the middle.
Therefore, the term 'Adit' is given in the Sutra. The term 'tri' is used to
negate two and one Nikayas. The question is, why does the term 'tri' not negate
four? The answer is, the term 'Adit' given in the Sutra indicates that the term
'tri' is not used to negate four. There are six Leshyas. To include four
Leshyas, the term 'Pitaanta' is used in the Sutra. Here, Pita should be taken as
Tejas Leshya. Here, first, there is a Bahuvrihi Samaas in the words Pita and
Anta, and then in the words Pitaanta and Leshya. This means that in the three
Nikayas of Bhavanvasi, Vyantara, and Jyotish, there are four Leshyas of Krishna,
Neel, Kapota, and Pita for the Devas.  **Special Note:** Although there is only
one Pita Leshya for Bhavanvasi, Vyantara, and Jyotish Devas, there is a rule
that those who die with the middle portion of Krishna, Neel, and Kapota Leshyas
are born as Mithyadrishti humans and Tiryanch in the Karmabhoomi, and those who
die with the middle portion of Pita Leshya are born as Mithyadrishti humans and
Tiryanch in the Bhogbhoomi in the Bhavan Trika. Since such humans and Tiryanch
have the three inauspicious Leshyas at the beginning of their death, these three
inauspicious Leshyas are also found in an insufficient state when they are born
in the Bhavan Trika. This is why they are said to have four Leshyas, including
Pita. The meaning is that in the Bhavan Trika, there are four Leshyas, including
Pita, in an insufficient state, and one Pita Leshya in a sufficient state.
8446. Now, to show the internal differences of these Nikayas, the next Sutra
says:  Those who are Kalpopapanna Deva, up to the four Nikayas of Devas, are of
ten, eight, five, and twelve types respectively. ||3||  8447. There are four
Deva Nikayas and four numbers, ten etc., so they should be understood in order.
For example, Bhavanvasis are of ten types, Vyantaras are of eight types,
Jyotishis are of five types, and Vaimanikas are of twelve types. From the
previous statement, all Vaimanikas are included in the twelve types, so the term
'Kalpopapannaparyantah' is used in the Sutra to negate Graiveyak etc.

## Chapter Four  [414 $ 450] Chapter Four [179 This is Kalyā. Even though the
concept of Kalpa is possible for those who reside in the Bhavan, due to
convention, the term Kalpa is used only for those who reside in the Vaimānika.
Those who are born in Kalpas are called Kalpopanna. Those who have Kalpopanna
Devas at the end of their existence are called Kalpopannaparyanta. $ 448. To
further explain the distinctions, it is said: Indra, Sāmānika, Trāstriśa,
Pāriṣada, Ātmarakṣa, Lokapāla, Anīka, Prakīrṇaka, Ābhiyogy, and Kilviṣika, each
one separately. ||4|| 8449. Those who are adorned with extraordinary qualities
like Aṇimā, etc., which are not found in other Devas, are called Indra. Whatever
is similar to the position, lifespan, strength, family, enjoyment, and
consumption, etc., which are devoid of command and sovereignty, is called
Sāmānika. Those who are in that similarity are called Sāmānika. They are great,
like fathers, gurus, and teachers. Those who are like ministers and priests are
called Trāstriśa. They are called Trāstriśa because they are Trāstriśa Devas.
Those who are like friends and companions in the assembly are called Pāriṣada.
Those who are like protectors are called Ātmarakṣa. Those who are like
protectors of wealth are called Lokapāla. Those who protect the world are called
Lokapāla. The seven types of Anīka, like infantry, etc., are those who are in
charge of the army. Those who are like the people of towns and villages are
called Prakīrṇaka. Those who are like servants, engaged in work like driving
vehicles, etc., are called Ābhiyogy. Those who are like those who reside on the
border are called Kilviṣika. Those who have a lot of Kilviṣa (sin) are called
Kilviṣika. $ 450. These ten categories, starting with Indra, are found in each
of the four Nikāyas, one by one. 1.  Yatsamānāyu- Mu. 2. -Vṛttāḥ. Antyavāsi- Ā.,

## 180] Sarvarthasiddhi  14158451.  Then, to explain the exceptions, the sutra
says: **"But the Vyantara and Jyotishka gods are devoid of the two distinctions
of Trastrish and Lokapala."** ||5|| 8451.  In the Vyantara and Jyotishka, except
for the two distinctions of Trastrish and Lokapala, the remaining eight
distinctions should be understood. 8452. Now, to explain whether there is one
Indra in each of these categories or some other rule, the next sutra says: **"In
the first two categories, there are two Indras."** ||6|| 8453.  The first two
categories are the Bhavanavasi and Vyantara.  Doubt: How can the second category
be called the first?  Solution:  The second category is called the first because
it is close to the first.  The word "Dvi-Indra" implies the meaning of "two
Indras".  For example, "Saptaparna" and "Ashtapaada".  Just as the words
"Saptaparna" and "Ashtapaada" imply the meaning of "seven leaves" and "eight
feet", respectively, so too should it be understood in the present context.
Explanation:  Among the Bhavanavasi, the two Indras of the Asura-Kumaras are
Chamara and Vairochana.  The two Indras of the Naga-Kumaras are Dharana and
Bhutananda.  The two Indras of the Vidyut-Kumaras are Harisingha and Harikanta.
The two Indras of the Suparna-Kumaras are Venudeva and Venudhari.  The two
Indras of the Agni-Kumaras are Agnishikha and Agni-manava.  The two Indras of
the Vata-Kumaras are Bailamba and Prabhanjana.  The two Indras of the Stanita-
Kumaras are Sughoṣa and Mahaghosa.  The two Indras of the Udadhi-Kumaras are
Jalakanta and Jalaprabha.  The two Indras of the Dvipa-Kumaras are Purna and
Vasishtha.  The two Indras of the Dik-Kumaras are Amitagati and Amitavahana.
Similarly, among the Vyantara, the two Indras of the Kinnaras are Kinnara and
Kimpurusha.  The two Indras of the Kimpurushas are Satpurusha and Mahapurusha.
The two Indras of the Mahoragas are Atikaya and Maha-kaya.  The two Indras of
the Gandharvas are Giterati and Gotyasha.  The two Indras of the Yakshas are
Purnabhadra and Manibhadra.  Therefore, to explain the exceptions, the next
sutra says: **"But the Vyantara and Jyotishka gods are devoid of the two
distinctions of Trastrish and Lokapala."** ||5||  8551.  In the Vyantara and
Jyotishka, except for the two distinctions of Trastrish and Lokapala, the
remaining eight distinctions should be understood. 8452. Now, to explain whether
there is one Indra in each of these categories or some other rule, the next
sutra says: **"In the first two categories, there are two Indras."** ||6|| 6453.
The first two categories are the Bhavanavasi and Vyantara.  Doubt: How can the
second category be called the first?  Solution:  The second category is called
the first because it is close to the first.  The word "Dvi-Indra" implies the
meaning of "two Indras".  For example, "Saptaparna" and "Ashtapaada".  Just as
the words "Saptaparna" and "Ashtapaada" imply the meaning of "seven leaves" and

Fourth Chapter. The Terrible and the Most Terrible Rakshasas. The Resembling and
the Non-resembling Bhutas. The Kala and the Mahakala Pishachas.   7. The Aishana
devas (devas up to the Aishana realm) are the Kayapravichara, i.e. they enjoy
sensual pleasures through the body.  8. The remaining devas are the
Sparsharupaśabdamanaḥpravichara, i.e. they enjoy pleasures of touch, form, sound
and mind.  The Kalpavasis (devas dwelling in the Kalpa realms) are the ones
remaining after the previously mentioned ones. Their enjoyment of touch, form,
sound and mind is without conflict with the Arsha tradition.

182] In the **Sarvarthasiddhi**, [419 $458] They attain the highest bliss merely
by seeing the beautiful forms, charming decorations, and graceful movements of
the **Shṛngāra**-like **Aakāra** (forms). In the **Shukra**, **Mahāshukra**,
**Shatāra**, and **Sahasrāra** heavens, the gods attain supreme joy merely by
hearing the sweet music, gentle laughter, delightful conversations, and the soft
sounds of ornaments of the divine women. In the **Ānata**, **Prāṇata**,
**Āraṇa**, and **Achyuta** kalpas, the gods attain supreme happiness merely by
thinking of their consorts. 8 458. Now, to determine the nature of the happiness
of the remaining gods, the following sūtra is stated: _ The others are devoid of
worldly pleasures. _ ||9|| $ 459. The word "**pare**" (others) is used to
include all the remaining gods. The word "**apravīcāra**" (devoid of worldly
pleasures) is used to indicate the attainment of supreme bliss. **Pravīcāra** is
the counteraction of pain. In the absence of this, they experience uninterrupted
supreme bliss. 8460. The ten categories of the gods of the first **nikāya** have
been mentioned. Now, to explain their general and specific designations, the
following sūtra is stated: The **bhavanavāsī** (heavenly dwellers) gods are of
ten types: **asurakumāra**, **nāgakumāra**, **vidyutkumāra**, **suparṇakumāra**,
**agnikumāra**, **vātakumāra**, **stanitakumāra**, **udadhikumāra**,
**dvīpakumāra**, and **dikkuṁāra**. ||10|| 8461. Those whose nature is to dwell
in palaces are called **bhavanavāsī**. This is the general designation of the
first **nikāya**. The **asura** etc. are specific designations, which are
obtained due to the rise of specific **nāmakarma** (karmic actions related to
names). Although all these gods have their own age and nature, their dress,
ornaments, weapons, vehicles, mounts, and games are similar to those of human
princes. Therefore, the word "**kumāra**" (prince) is commonly used for all
**bhavanavāsī**. This word "**kumāra**" should be added to each of them. For
example, **asurakumāra** etc. Question: Where are their palaces? Answer: The
palaces of the **asurakumāra** are in the **pankabahula** (muddy) part of the
**ratnaprabhā** (jewel-like) heaven. And in the **kharapṛthivī** (rough earth)
part, one thousand **yojanas** (a unit of distance) above and below are
excluded.

-4112 § 465] The abodes of the Kumaras of the remaining Nāgas. Chapter Four
6462. To determine the general and specific designations of the second Nikāya,
it is said— The Vyantaras are eight types: Kinnara, Kimpurusha, Mahoraga,
Gandharva, Yaksha, Rakshasa, Bhūta, and Pishacha. 1110 8463. Those who reside in
various distant lands are called 'Vyantaras', a general designation that applies
to all eight types. These eight types of Vyantaras, from Kinnara onwards, are to
be understood as arising from specific name-karma. The question arises: Where
are their abodes? The answer is: Beyond this Jambudvipa, crossing countless
islands and oceans, in the upper region of the Kharapṛthivī, are the abodes of
seven types of Vyantaras. The Rakshasas reside in the region abundant with mud.
8464. To state the general and specific designations of the third Nikāya, it is
said— The Jyotishkas are five types: Surya, Chandra, Graha, Nakshatra, and
Prakirṇaka stars. 112 8465. These five types are all luminous, hence the general
designation 'Jyotishkas' is meaningful. Surya and the others are specific
designations arising from specific name-karma. The separate mention of 'Surya
and Chandra' is to indicate their prominence. The question arises: What is the
reason for their prominence? The answer is: It is due to their influence and the
like. The question arises: Where are their abodes? The answer is: From this same
landmass, rising upwards for seven hundred and ninety yojanas, the stars wander,
situated below all the Jyotishkas. From there, rising upwards for ten yojanas,
the Surya wanders. From there, rising upwards for eighty yojanas, the Chandra
revolves. Rising upwards for four yojanas are the Nakshatras. From there, rising
upwards for four yojanas are the Budhas. From there, rising upwards for three
yojanas are the Kumaras.

184] Sarvarthasiddhi [41138466 yojanas above the earth are the stars. From
there, four yojanas above are the constellations. From there, four yojanas above
is Mercury. From there, three yojanas above is Venus. From there, three yojanas
above is Jupiter. From there, three yojanas above is Mars. From there, three
yojanas above is Saturn. This celestial sphere, filled with the celestial
beings, is one hundred and ten yojanas thick and extends to the end of the
ocean, encompassing countless islands and seas. It is said: "From the surface of
the earth, seven hundred and ninety yojanas above are the stars. Then, ten
yojanas above is the sun. Then, eighty yojanas above is the moon. Then, four
yojanas above are the constellations and four yojanas above is Mercury. Then,
four times three yojanas above, that is, three yojanas above each, are Venus,
Jupiter, Mars, and Saturn respectively." 8466. Now, to explain the specific
movement of the celestial beings, the next sutra says: The celestial beings
circumambulate Mount Meru in the human realm and are constantly in motion. 13॥
8467. 'Meru-pradakshina' is a compound word in the sixth case. The word 'Meru-
pradakshina' is used to explain the specific movement and to prevent any
misunderstanding about a different movement. The word 'nitya-gatayah' is used to
explain that they are constantly engaged in the action of movement. The word
'nri-loka' is used to indicate the realm of these celestial beings. The meaning
is that the celestial beings constantly move in the two and a half islands and
two seas, and not elsewhere. Doubt: The cause of the movement of the celestial
beings' vehicles is not found, so their movement cannot be established?
Solution: No, because this reason is not valid. The fact is that the celestial
beings' vehicles are constantly moving due to the influence of the worthy beings
who are engaged in movement. If it is said that why are the worthy beings
constantly engaged in movement, then the answer is that this is the peculiarity
of the result of karma. Their karma is being ripened through the form of
movement. 1. Tatha chatvari yoja- ta.. na., tattva.। 2. Tatha chatvari yoja-

-4114 § 4697 Chapter Four The luminous bodies revolve in a clockwise direction,
having attained the eleven types of yogas. S 160 In order to understand the
relationship between the motion of the luminous bodies and the time of activity,
it is said - the time division made by them. ||14|| $ 469. The word 'tat' is
used to refer to the luminous bodies that move. Time is not determined by motion
alone, nor by luminous bodies alone; because of the non-perception of the former
and the non-change of the latter. Time is of two types: practical and primary.
The practical time division is the time, the time-interval, etc., made by them,
which is defined by a particular action and is the cause of the definition of
something else that is not defined. The primary is different, whose
characteristics will be described later. 1185 is the result. This is the reason
why they are constantly engaged in moving. Although the luminous deities revolve
around Mount Meru, they still wander eleven hundred and twenty-one yojanas away
from Mount Meru. $ 468. Now, to give knowledge of the practical time in relation
to the luminous bodies that move, the next sutra is said The time division made
by those moving luminous bodies is. ||14|| $ 469. The word 'tat' is used in the
sutra to refer to the moving luminous deities. Time cannot be determined by
motion alone, because it is not perceived, and time cannot be determined by
luminous bodies alone without motion, because without change it will always
remain the same. This is why the word 'tat' is used here to refer to the moving
luminous bodies. Time is of two types: practical time and primary time. Of
these, time and time-interval, etc., are the practical time divisions made by
the moving luminous deities. This is known by a particular action and is the
cause of knowing other things that are not known. Primary time is different,
whose characteristics will be described later. Special Note - Humans are found
within the Manushottara mountain. The total extent from one side of the
Manushottara mountain to the other is forty-five lakh yojanas. Humans are found
in this area, therefore it is called the human world. In this world, the
luminous bodies always revolve. Their revolution is around Meru. There is no
luminous body sphere around Meru up to eleven hundred and twenty-one yojanas.
Beyond this, it is scattered everywhere in the sky. There are two suns and two
moons in Jambudvipa. One sun revolves around the entire Jambudvipa in two days
and nights. Its four regions are considered to be 180 yojanas in Jambudvipa and
3300 yojanas in the salt ocean. The total number of lanes of the sun's
revolution is 184. This area is divided into these lanes. A distance of two
yojanas is considered between one lane and another. When the size of the sun's
disc is added to this, it becomes 200 yojanas. This is the difference in
sunrise. The difference in the sphere is only two yojanas. It takes a little
more than two days and nights for the moon to complete its revolution. The
difference in the moonrise comes from this. There are four suns, four moons in
the salt ocean; twelve suns, twelve moons in the Dhatukikhanda; forty-two suns,
forty-two moons in the Kalodadhi; and seventy-two suns, seventy-two moons in the
Pushkarardha. Thus, there are one hundred and thirty-two suns and one hundred
and thirty-two moons in the two and a half islands. Of these two, the moon,
Indra and the sun are the Pratyindra. The family of each moon consists of one
sun, twenty-eight constellations, eighty-eight planets and sixty-six thousand
nine hundred kodi kodi stars. Although the movement of these luminous bodies is
their nature, the eligible deities constantly carry the chariots of the sun,
etc. These deities take the form of lions, elephants, bulls and horses. The
lion-shaped deities...

## 136] **Sarvarthasiddhi**  [4115 $ 4708 470. To explain the location of the
Jyotishis, the next Sutra says: **They are located outside.** ||15|| 6 471. The
word 'bahiḥ' (outside) is used.  Question: Outside of what? Answer: Outside of
the human realm (nṛloka). Question: How do we know this? Answer: The change in
the case ending of the word 'nṛloka' in the previous Sutra indicates that the
word 'bahiḥ' refers to the outside of the human realm. Question: But the
previous Sutra stated that the Jyotishis are constantly moving within the human
realm. Therefore, their location outside of it is already established. So, the
statement 'bahiḥavastītāḥ' (they are located outside) is meaningless. Answer:
That is not correct. Because the existence and location of the Jyotishis outside
of the human realm is not established. Therefore, the statement 'bahiḥavastītāḥ'
is used to establish both their existence and location. This Sutra is also used
to negate the possibility of their movement in the opposite direction and their
occasional movement. || 8 472. To introduce the general name of the fourth
category, the next Sutra says: **They are Vaimanikas.** ||16|| 8473. The word
'Vaimanika' is used to establish their authority. The beings who will be
described next are Vaimanikas. This statement establishes their authority. Those
who consider the beings residing within them as their own souls are called
Vimana. And those who reside in those Vimana are called Vaimanikas. There are
three types of Vimana: Indraka, Shreṇibaddha, and Pushpaprakirṇaka. Among them,
the Indraka Vimana are located in the middle, like Indra. They are arranged in
rows like the regions of the sky in the four directions. The faces of the
elephant-like Devas are towards the south, the faces of the bull-like Devas are
towards the west, and the faces of the horse-like Devas are towards the north.
8470. Now, to explain the location of the twelve Jyotishis in the second half of
the Dwīpa, the next Sutra says: **The Jyotishi Devas reside outside the human
realm.** ||15|| 8471. The Sutra uses the word 'bahiḥ' (outside). Question:
Outside of what? Answer: Outside of the human realm. Question: How do we know
this? Answer: The word 'nṛloka' (human realm) appears in the previous Sutra. The
change in the case ending of the word 'nṛloka' indicates that the word 'bahiḥ'
refers to the outside of the human realm. Question: But the previous Sutra
stated that the Jyotishis are constantly moving within the human realm.
Therefore, their location outside of it is already established. So, the
statement 'bahiḥavastītāḥ' (they are located outside) is meaningless. Answer:
That is not correct. Because the existence and location of the Jyotishis outside
of the human realm is not established. Therefore, the statement 'bahiḥavastītāḥ'
is used to establish both their existence and location. This Sutra is also used
to negate the possibility of their movement in the opposite direction and their
occasional movement.  6472. Now, to introduce the general name of the fourth
category, the next Sutra says: **The Devas of the fourth category are
Vaimanikas.** ||16|| 6473. The word 'Vaimanika' is used to establish their
authority. The beings who will be described next are Vaimanikas. This statement
establishes their authority. Those who consider the beings residing within them
as their own souls are called Vimana. And those who reside in those Vimana are
called Vaimanikas. There are three types of Vimana: Indraka, Shreṇibaddha, and

faces of the bull-like Devas are towards the west, and the faces of the horse-
like Devas are towards the north.  8470. Now, to explain the location of the
twelve Jyotishis in the second half of the Dwīpa, the next Sutra says: **The
Jyotishi Devas reside outside the human realm.** ||15|| 8471. The Sutra uses the

-4119 § 479] The Vimanas. Those which are situated in the directions like
scattered flowers are called Pushpaprakirnakas. 8474. To understand the
difference of these Vaimanikas, the Sutra says: They are Kalpopapanna and
Kalpatita. ||17|| 8475. Those who are born in Kalpas are called Kalpopapanna.
And those who are beyond Kalpas are called Kalpatita. Thus, there are two types
of Vaimanikas. § 476. Now, to understand their specific location, the Sutra
says: They reside above. ||18|| 8477. Question: Why is this said? Answer: It is
said to negate their oblique position. They do not reside obliquely like the
Jyotishkas. Nor do they reside unevenly like the Vyantaras. They are said to be
"above". Question: What are they? Answer: Kalpas. 8478. If so, in how many Kalpa
Vimanas do those Devas reside? To answer this, the Sutra says: In the Saudharma,
Aishana, Sanatkumara, Mahendra, Brahma, Brahmottara, Lantava, Kapishtha, Shukra,
Mahashukra, Shatara, and Sahasrar, as well as in the Anata Pranata, Aran-
Achyuta, nine Graiveyakas, and Vijay, Vaijayanta, Jayanta, Aparajita, and
Sarvarthasiddhi. ||19|| 8479. Question: How do these Saudharma, etc., words
become names of Kalpas? Answer: In grammar, the suffix "an" has four meanings.
By this, the words Saudharma, etc., become names of Kalpas, or they are called
Kalpas by nature. Question: How are the words Saudharma, etc., names of Indra?
Answer: By nature or by association. Question: How so? Answer: Saudharma is the
name of a Sabha (assembly), and Indra resides in it. Therefore, it is called the
Saudharma Kalpa. "Tadasminnasti" means "in that". "An" is the suffix.

## 188] **Sarvarthasiddhi**  [41198419] The Indra of the Saudharma Kalpa is also
known as Saudharma, due to his association with the Kalpa. The Indra's natural
name is Ishana. The Kalpa where Ishana resides is called Aishana. The term
"Aishana" is derived from the sutra "Tasyanivasah".  Therefore, the Indra
associated with this Kalpa is also called Aishana. The Indra's natural name is
Sanatkumara. The term "Sanatkumara" is derived from the sutra "Tasyanivasah".
Therefore, the Indra associated with this Kalpa is also called Sanatkumara. The
Indra's natural name is Mahendra. The Kalpa where Mahendra resides is called
Maheindra. Therefore, the Indra associated with this Kalpa is also called
Maheindra. This pattern continues for the remaining Kalpas.  The relationship
between the Kalpas is established by the term "Uparyupari" based on the Agamas.
The Saudharma and Aishana Kalpas are the first two. Above them are the
Sanatkumara and Maheindra Kalpas. Above them are the Brahmaloka and Brahmottara
Kalpas. Above them are the Lantava and Kapishtha Kalpas. Above them are the
Shukra and Mahashukra Kalpas. Above them are the Shatara and Sahasra Kalpas.
Above them are the Anata and Pranata Kalpas. Above them are the Aran and Achyuta
Kalpas.  Each Kalpa has its own Indra, both below and above. However, there is a
single Indra for each pair of Kalpas in the middle. There are four Indras for
the four Kalpas: Saudharma, Aishana, Sanatkumara, and Maheindra. There is one
Indra named Brahma for the two Kalpas: Brahmaloka and Brahmottara. There is one
Indra named Lantava for the two Kalpas: Lantava and Kapishtha. There is one
Indra named Shukra for the two Kalpas: Shukra and Mahashukra. There is one Indra
named Shatara for the two Kalpas: Shatara and Sahasra. There are four Indras for
the four Kalpas: Anata, Pranata, Aran, and Achyuta.  Therefore, there are twelve
Indras residing in the Kalpas. In Jambudvipa, there is a mountain called
Mahamandara, which is one thousand yojanas deep and ninety thousand yojanas
high. Below it is the Adholoka. The Tiryanloka is as wide and thick as the
height of Mount Meru. Above it is the Urdhvaloka, whose Meru peak is forty
yojanas wide. Above it, at a distance of a hair's breadth, is...   1.

[189 -4120 8482] Chapter Four: Forty Yojanas of Shadow. In that, the Indraka, a
non-moving aircraft, is situated in the space of a hair's breadth in the Uri.
All else should be known from the Lokanuyoga. Why is the word 'nava' (nine)
mentioned separately in 'navasu aveyakeshu'? This is to indicate that there are
nine other aircraft called Anudisha. Therefore, the Anudishas should be
understood. 6 480. To explain the differences between these authorized aircraft,
the following sutra is stated: "They are superior in terms of position,
influence, happiness, radiance, purity of leshya, sense-object, and avadhi-
object." ||20|| 8481. Position is the state of being with the body in that
existence from the rise of the lifespan obtained by oneself. Influence is the
power of curse and grace. Happiness is the experience of sense-objects. Radiance
is the brilliance of the body, clothes, ornaments, etc. Leshya has been
mentioned. Purity of leshya is called leshya-vishuddhi. The object of the senses
and avadhi-knowledge is called indriya-vishaya and avadhi-vishaya. They are
superior to these or in comparison to these. This means that the aircraft are
superior in terms of position, etc., in each successive kalpa and prastara.
8482. Just as these aircraft are superior in terms of position, etc., in each
successive kalpa, so too they are superior in terms of speed, etc. To negate
this, the following sutra is stated: 1. -Vachanam anya- Ta., Na. 2. -Manani
santiti Aa., Ta., Na. 3. Tanaam paraspa- Aa.: +.m sthanam Aa., Di. 1, Di. 2. 5.

## 190] Sarvartha Siddhi  [4121] 8483. **Gati**, **Sharira**, **Parigraha**, and
**Abhimana** are all inferior in the higher gods, one after the other. ||21||
8483. **Gati** is the means of attaining a different place from one's current
location. **Sharira** refers to the **Vaikriyika** body, as previously
mentioned. **Parigraha** is the attachment to objects arising from the **Lobha**
(greed) **Kashaya**. **Abhimana** is the ego arising from the **Mana** (pride)
**Kashaya**. These **Gati** and other factors are inferior in the higher gods,
one after the other. They have less desire for play and enjoyment in different
places, hence their **Gati** is less. The **Sharira** of the gods in the
**Saudharm** and **Aishana** heavens is seven **Ratni** in size. The **Sharira**
of the gods in the **Sanatkumara** and **Maheindra** heavens is six **Ratni** in
size. The **Sharira** of the gods in the **Brahma**, **Brahmottara**,
**Lantava**, and **Kapishtha** kalpas is five **Ratni** in size. The **Sharira**
of the gods in the **Shukra**, **MahaShukra**, **Shatara**, and **Sahasra**
kalpas is four **Ratni** in size. The **Sharira** of the gods in the **Anata**
and **Pranata** kalpas is three and a half **Ratni** in size. The **Sharira** of
the gods in the **Arana** and **Achyuta** kalpas is three **Ratni** in size. The
**Sharira** of the gods in the **Adhograiveya** is two and a half **Ratni** in
size. The **Sharira** of the gods in the **Madhyagraiveya** is two **Ratni** in
size. The **Sharira** of the gods in the **Uparimagraiveya** and **Anudisha** is
one and a half **Ratni** in size. The **Sharira** of the gods in the five
**Anuttara** Vimanas is one **Ratni** in size. **Parigraha**, such as the size
and shape of the Vimanas, is also inferior in the higher gods, one after the
other. **Abhimana** is also inferior in the higher gods, one after the other,
due to their lesser **Kashaya**.  8484. The **Leshya** of the gods in the first
three **Nikayas** has been explained previously. Now, to explain the **Leshya**
of the **Vaimanika** gods, the following sutra is given:  **Pita**, **Padma**,
and **Shukla** **Leshya** are present in the gods of the two, three, and
remaining **Kalpa** pairs, respectively. ||22||  8485. **Pita**, **Padma**, and
**Shukla** are in **Dvandva** compound, and then **Leshya** is in **Bahuvrihi**
compound.

## Chapter Four  [191]  They are those who have the **Pita**, **Padma** and
**Shukla** **leshyas**. How is the shortness (of the words)? It is due to
**auttarpadika** (rule). For example, in the **druta** (fast) **vrutti**
(chanting), the **taparakarna** (pronunciation) is done, and in the **madhyama**
(medium) and **vilambita** (slow) **vrutti**, its **upasanchyan**
(pronunciation) is done. Or, **Pita**, **Padma** and **Shukla** are the meanings
of the **varna** (color) of those who have **leshyas** similar to them. They are
those who have **Pita**, **Padma** and **Shukla** **leshyas**. Which **leshya**
belongs to whom? It is said here:  In the **Soudharma** and **Aishana**
**kalpas** (epochs), there is **Pita** **leshya**. In the **Sanatkumar** and
**Maheindra** **kalpas**, there are **Pita** and **Padma** **leshyas**. In the
**Brahmaloka**, **Brahmottara**, **Lantava** and **Kapishtha** **kalpas**, there
is **Padma** **leshya**. In the **Shukra**, **MahaShukra**, **Shatara** and
**Sahasrar** **kalpas**, there are **Padma** and **Shukla** **leshyas**. In the
**Anata** etc., there is **Shukla** **leshya**. In that too, in the **Anudisha**
and **Anuttara** **vimanas** (planes), there is **ParamShukla** **leshya**.
**Doubt:** How is the **misra** (mixed) **leshya** taken, which is not mentioned
in the **sutra** (rule)?  **Solution:** It is taken due to **sahacharya**
(association), like in the world. For example, when it is said, "The **chhatri**
(umbrella-holders) are going", the **achhatri** (non-umbrella-holders) also have
the **chhatri** (umbrella) **vyavahar** (usage). Similarly, here also, one of
the two **misra** **leshyas** is taken.  **Doubt:** How is this meaning
understood from the **sutra**?  **Solution:** It should be related like this: In
two **kalpa** **yugalas** (pairs of epochs), there is **Pita** **leshya**. Here,
in the **Sanatkumar** and **Maheindra** **kalpas**, there is no **vivaksha**
(intention) of **Padma** **leshya**. In the **Brahmaloka** etc. three **kalpa**
**yugalas**, there is **Padma** **leshya**. In the **Shukra** and
**MahaShukra**, there is no **vivaksha** of **Shukla** **leshya**. In the
remaining **Shatara** etc., there is **Shukla** **leshya**. There is no
**vivaksha** of **Padma** **leshya**. Therefore, there is no fault.  1.
**Tarpadika** etc., **A.** (**Agama**), **Di.** (**Digambara**), 1, **Di.** 21
2. As said: **Du.** (**Dushkari**), **Mu.** (**Muni**), **Na.**
(**Natyasutra**), **Ta.** (**Tattvartha**), 3, "In the **druta** **vrutti**, the
**taparakarna** is done, and in the **madhyama** and **vilambita** **vrutti**,
its **upasanchyan** is done due to **kalabheda** (difference in time). In the
**druta** **vrutti**, the **taparakarna** is done, and in the **madhyama** and
**vilambita** **vrutti**, its **upasanchyan** should be done. Similarly, in the
**madhyama**, the **druta** and **vilambita** are done, and in the
**vilambita**, the **druta** and **madhyama** are done. What is the reason? It
is not accomplished. It is due to **kalabheda**. Because, the **varnas**
(letters) which are three parts more in the **druta** **vrutti**, are in the
**madhyama**. And the **varnas** which are three parts more in the **madhyama**
**vrutti**, are in the **vilambita**." - **Pa.** (**Pravacana**), **Ma.**
(**Mahatma**), **Ma.** (**Mahatma**), 1, 1, 9. 4. **Khyanam** (pronunciation)
etc. **Druta**, **Madhyama**, **Vilambita** etc. Or, **A.** (**Agama**), **Di.**
(**Digambara**), 1 - **Khyanam** (pronunciation) etc. **Druta**, **Madhyama**,
**Vilambita** etc. Or, **Di.** (**Digambara**), 2.

## 192] Sarvartha Siddhi  [4123 84868486. It has been said that they are Kalpa-
upapanna, but it is not known who these Kalpas are. Therefore, the next Sutra
says: Kalpas are those who are before the nine Graiveyakas. ||23|| 8487. It is
not known from where the Kalpas begin, therefore the word Saudharma etc. is
understood to be continued. From this, it is understood that Saudharma and the
other nine Graiveyakas are Kalpas. By the principle of Pariseṣya, the rest are
beyond Kalpas. 8488. Where are the Lokāntika Devas, who are Vaimānika? They are
included in the Vaimānikas. How? The next Sutra says: The abode of the Lokāntika
Devas is Brahmaloka. ||24|| 8489. They come and merge into it, therefore it is
called Ālaya or Āvāsa. Those whose abode is Brahmaloka are known as Lokāntika
Devas who reside in Brahmaloka. If this is so, then all the Devas who reside in
Brahmaloka would be Lokāntika. This is not a fault because of the acceptance of
the meaningful term. The word Lokāntika is derived from the word Loka, which
refers to Brahmaloka, and its end, or boundary, is called Lokānta. Those who
reside there are called Lokāntika. Therefore, not all the Devas who reside in
Brahmaloka are included. Their Vimānas are situated at the boundary of
Brahmaloka. Or, the world, which is filled with birth, old age, and death, is
called Samsāra, and its end is called Lokānta. Those who reside at the end of
Samsāra are called Lokāntika. They are all Pariita-Samsārī, and after leaving
there, they will attain Nirvāṇa after residing in a womb once more. 8490. To
show the different types of these Lokāntika Devas, who have been described in
general, the next Sutra says: Sārasvata, Āditya, Vahni, Aruṇa, Gardatoya,
Tuṣita, Avyābādha, and Aniṣṭa are the Lokāntika Devas. ||25||

## Chapter Four  **41268 493]**  **8491.** Where do the Sarvasvatas and others
reside? It should be known that these Sarvasvatas and other groups of gods
reside in the eight directions, starting from the east and going clockwise. For
example, in the northeast corner are the Sarvasvata vimanas, in the east are the
Aditya vimanas, in the southeast are the Agni vimanas, in the south are the Arun
vimanas, in the southwest corner are the Gardatoya vimanas, in the west are the
Tusita vimanas, in the northwest are the Avyabadha vimanas, and in the north are
the Arishta vimanas. The word "cha" (and) in the sutra indicates that there are
two more groups of gods between each of these. For example, between the
Sarvasvatas and the Adityas are the Agnyabhas and Suryabhas. Between the Adityas
and the Agnis are the Chandrabhas and Satyabhas. Between the Agnis and the
Arunas are the Shreyaskaras and Kshemankaras. Between the Arunas and the
Gardatoyas are the Vrishabheshtas and Kamacharas. Between the Gardatoyas and the
Tusitas are the Nirmanarajas and Digantarakshitas. Between the Tusitas and the
Avyabadhas are the Atmarakshitas and Sarvarakshitas. Between the Avyabadhas and
the Arishta are the Maruts and Vasus. Between the Arishtas and the Sarvasvatas
are the Ashvas and Vishvas. All these gods are independent, as they are not
subject to any higher authority. They are Devarishis, free from worldly desires,
and are worshipped by other gods. They are the fourteen previous Dharas, and are
known to be dedicated to the liberation and enlightenment of the Tirthankaras.
**8492.** It has been said that the Laukantika gods, after being liberated from
their worldly existence, attain nirvana after being born in a womb. Is there a
similar difference in the time of attaining nirvana for other gods? To answer
this, the next sutra says:  **26. In the Vijayavimanas, there are two types of
gods.**  **8493.** The word "adi" (and so on) here refers to the types. This
means that the Vijay, Vaijayanta, Jayanta, Aparajita, and the nine Anudigas are
included. What is the type here? The type here is the birth of Samyagdrstis
while being an Indra. If you say that this leads to the fulfillment of all
desires, then it is not so, because they are not the highest. The meaning of the
word "charma" (extreme) is established by the fact that they are the ultimate.
The ultimate state is...

## 194] **Sarvarthasiddhi** [4127 § 494 With respect to the human existence of
the body. There are two ultimate bodies, those who have them are called
Dvicharama. Those who fall from victory etc. and do not abandon right faith, are
born as humans, perform austerities, attain victory etc. again, and then fall
from there, again attain human birth and become Siddhas. This is called
Dvicharama-dehatva. 494. It is said that the path of the lower births is
auspicious for the living being in its worldly states. Again, in the context of
the state, the sutra says "and those born in lower births". There, it is not
known who are the lower births. To this, the commentary says, "Except for
humans, the rest are lower births." ||27|| $ 495. The commentary has already
mentioned the gods and hell beings. Humans have also been mentioned earlier in
the context of "humans who were previously humans". Other than these, the
remaining beings who are in the cycle of birth and death are to be understood as
lower births. Should their separate realms be described, just like the realms of
gods etc.? Since they are present in all realms, their separate realms are not
mentioned. 8 496. It is said that the state of hell beings, humans, and lower
births has been mentioned. The state of gods has not been mentioned. To mention
that, first, to explain the state of those who reside in the abodes mentioned
earlier, the following sutra is said.  1. The rest are lower births, Mu., Di. 2

have a status comparable to one Sagaropama, three Palyopama, two and a half
Palyopama, two Palyopama, and one and a half Palyopama respectively. ||28||
8497. The relationship of the Asuras, etc., with the Sagaropama, etc., should be
understood in order. This is the excellent status. The inferior status will be
mentioned later. Thus, the Asuras have a status comparable to one Sagaropama.
The Nagas have a status comparable to three Palyopama. The Suparnas have a
status comparable to two and a half Palyopama. The Dvipas have a status
comparable to two Palyopama. And the rest of the six have a status comparable to
one and a half Palyopama. $ 498. After mentioning the status of the first group
of Devas, the status of the Vyantara and Jyotishis is due in order. But,
bypassing them, the status of the Vaimanikas is mentioned. Why? Because the
status of the Vyantara and Jyotishis will be mentioned briefly later. To state
the status of the two Kalpas mentioned in the beginning, the following Sutra is
said: The Saudharma and Aishana Kalpas have a status slightly greater than two
Sagaropama. ||29|| $ 499. The dual form 'Sagaropame' indicates two. 'Adhike' is
the word of authority. Where does this authority extend to? Up to the Sahasrar
Kalpa. How is this known? It is known from the word 'tu' in the next Sutra.
Thus, it is to be understood that the Saudharma and Aishana Kalpas have a status
slightly greater than two Sagaropama. $500. To understand the specific status of
the next two Kalpas, the following Sutra is said: The Sanatkumara and Maheindra
Kalpas have a status slightly greater than seven Sagaropama. ||30|| 8501. In
these two Kalpas, the Devas have a slightly greater status of seven Sagaropama.
The Asura Kumaras, Naga Kumaras, Suparna Kumaras, Dvipa Kumaras, and the rest of
the residents of the Bhavanas have a status comparable to one Sagaropama, three
Palyopama, two and a half Palyopama, two Palyopama, and one and a half Palyopama
respectively. ||28|| 8.497. Here, the relationship of the Asura Kumaras, etc.,
with the Sagaropama, etc., should be understood in order. This is the excellent
status. The inferior status will be mentioned later. Thus, the Asuras have a
status comparable to one Sagaropama. The Naga Kumaras have a status comparable
to three Palyopama. The Suparnas have a status comparable to two and a half
Palyopama. The Dvipas have a status comparable to two Palyopama. And the rest of
the six Kumaras have a status comparable to one and a half Palyopama. 8498.
After mentioning the status of the first group of Devas, the status of the
Vyantara and Jyotishis is due in order. But, bypassing them, the status of the
Vaimanikas is mentioned; because the status of the Vyantara and Jyotishis will
be mentioned briefly later. To state the status of the two Kalpas mentioned in
the beginning, the following Sutra is said: _ The Saudharma and Aishana Kalpas
have a status slightly greater than two Sagaropama. ||29|| 8499. The Sutra uses
the dual form 'Sagaropame', which indicates two Sagaropama. 'Adhike' is the word
of authority. Question- Where does this authority extend to? Answer- Up to the
Sahasrar Kalpa. Question- How is this known? Answer- It is known from the word
'tu' in the next Sutra. Thus, it is certain that the Saudharma and Aishana
Kalpas have a status slightly greater than two Sagaropama. 00. Now, to
understand the specific status of the next two Kalpas, the following Sutra is
said: The Sanatkumara and Maheindra Kalpas have a status slightly greater than
seven Sagaropama. ||30|| 8501. In these two Kalpas, the Devas have a slightly
greater status of seven Sagaropama. 1.-pama status: Mu.

## 196] **Sarvarthasiddhi**  [4131 $ 5028502. To explain the specific state of
being in the Brahma-loka and other realms, up to Achyuta, the following sutra is
stated: **Trisaptanavaikadashatrayodashapanchadashabhiradhikani tu ||31||**
8503. The term 'sapta' (seven) is taken from the previous sutra. Its connection
with the numbers three, etc., mentioned here should be understood. For example,
seven plus three, seven plus seven, etc. The connection between each pair should
be understood. The word 'tu' indicates a specific meaning. What does it specify?
The word 'adhika' (more) is understood to be connected with the four numbers
(three, etc.) and not with the last two. Therefore, the meaning is as follows:
In the Brahma-loka and Brahma-uttar, the state of being is ten sagaropama more.
In the Lantava and Kapishtha, the state of being is fourteen sagaropama more. In
the Shukra and Maha-shukra, the state of being is sixteen sagaropama more. In
the Shatara and Sahasrar, the state of being is eighteen sagaropama more. In the
Anata and Pranata, the state of being is twenty sagaropama more. In the Aran and
Achyuta, the state of being is twenty-two sagaropama more.  8504. To explain the
specific state of being in the realms above Aran-Achyuta, the following sutra is
stated: **Praranachutavardhvamakeanavasuveyakeshuvijayadishu sarvarthasiddhau
cha ||32||** $ 505. The term 'adhika' (more) is understood from the previous
sutra. Therefore, the connection should be understood as follows: One more in
each.  8502. Now, to explain the specific state of being in the kalpas from
Brahma-loka up to Achyuta, the following sutra is stated: From the pair Brahma-
Brahmottara up to the pair Aran-Achyuta, in each pair, the state of being is
seven sagaropama more than three, seven sagaropama more than seven, seven
sagaropama more than nine, seven sagaropama more than eleven, seven sagaropama
more than thirteen, and seven sagaropama more than fifteen. ||31||  8503. Here,
the term 'sapta' (seven) is taken from the previous sutra. Its connection with
the numbers three, etc., mentioned here should be understood. For example, three
more than seven, seven more than seven, etc. And, the connection between each
pair should be understood in sequence. The word 'tu' in the sutra is used to
indicate a specific meaning. Question: What specific meaning does it convey?
Answer: It conveys the specific meaning that the word 'adhika' (more) is
understood to be connected with the four numbers (three, etc.) and not with the
last two states of being. Therefore, the meaning here is as follows: In Brahma-
loka and Brahma-uttar, the state of being is ten sagaropama more. In Lantava and
Kapishtha, the state of being is fourteen sagaropama more. In Shukra and Maha-
shukra, the state of being is sixteen sagaropama more. In Shatara and Sahasrar,
the state of being is eighteen sagaropama more. In Anata and Pranata, the state
of being is twenty sagaropama more. And, in Aran and Achyuta, the state of being
is twenty-two sagaropama more.  8504. Now, to explain the specific state of
being in the realms above Aran-Achyuta, the following sutra is stated: Above
Aran-Achyuta, in each of the nine praveyakas, in each of the nine anudishas, and
in each of the four vijayadikas, the state of being is one sagaropama more. And,
in Sarvarthasiddhi, the state of being is thirty-three sagaropama. ||32||  8505.
The term 'adhika' (more) is understood from the previous sutra, therefore, the
connection here should be understood as follows: One more in each.

## Chapter Four  [197]  **Why is the term "nine" used?** It is used to indicate
that each [heavenly abode] has one more [Sagaropama] than the previous one.
Otherwise, there would only be one more Sagaropama in the Graiveyakas. The word
"Adi" in "Vijayādi" is a general term, so it includes the Anudishas. The
separate mention of "Sarvarthasiddhi" is to indicate that it does not have a
lower [Sagaropama] level. Therefore, the meaning is: In the Adhograiveyakas, the
first has twenty-three Sagaropama, the second has twenty-four, and the third has
twenty-five. In the Madhyamagraiveyakas, the first has twenty-six, the second
has twenty-seven, and the third has twenty-eight. In the Uparimagraiveyakas, the
first has twenty-nine, the second has thirty, and the third has thirty-one. In
the Anudish Vimanas, there are thirty-two Sagaropama. In the Vijayādi, there are
thirty-three Sagaropama, which is the highest level, even in Sarvarthasiddhi.
**§ 506.** To indicate the lower level in the heavenly abodes with the highest
level, the following Sutra is stated:  "The lower level is one Palyopama more
than the previous one." [33]  **§ 507.** The Palyopama has been explained. The
lower level is one Palyopama more. Whose is this? It is for the Saudharma and
Aishana Kalpas. How is this understood? It will be stated later that "the higher
level of the previous ones is the lower level of the next ones."  **§ 508.** To
indicate the lower level of the heavenly abodes above the Saudharma and Aishana
Kalpas, the following Sutra is stated:  "The higher level of the previous ones
is the lower level of the next ones." [34]  1. Jajanysthiti: Mu. 2.

##  [198] **Sarvarthasiddhi** [4135 § 509 $ 509. 'Paratah' here means 'in the
next place'. The word 'dvitva' is used in the sense of 'repetition'. Similarly,
the word 'purva' is also used in the sense of 'repetition'. The word 'adhika' is
understood here. Therefore, the connection should be made in this way: In the
Saudharma and Aishana kalpas, the superior state, which is two sagaropama,
becomes the inferior state in the Sanatkumara and Maheendra kalpas when one time
is added to it. In the Sanatkumara and Maheendra kalpas, the superior state,
which is seven sagaropama, becomes the inferior state in the Brahma and
Brahmottara kalpas when one time is added to it, and so on. 8510. The superior
state of the narakas has been mentioned. Although the inferior state is not
mentioned in the sutra, the Acharya wants to explain it briefly. Therefore, he
says in the next sutra: The superior state of the narakas in the second and
subsequent realms is the inferior state in the next and subsequent realms.
||35|| 8511. Question: Why is the word 'cha' used in the sutra? Answer: The word
'cha' is used to summarize the subject matter. Question: What is the subject
matter? Answer: The subject matter is 'paratah paratah purva purva anantara
aparaa sthitih'. Therefore, the word 'cha' summarizes this. This means that the
superior state of the narakas in the Ratnaprabha, which is one sagaropama, is
the inferior state in the Sharkaraprabha. The superior state in the
Sharkaraprabha, which is three sagaropama, is the inferior state in the
Valukaprabha, and so on. 8512. Thus, the inferior state in the second and
subsequent narakas has been mentioned. Now, to explain the inferior state in the
first naraka, the Acharya says in the next sutra: In the first realm, the
inferior state is ten thousand years. ||36|| § 513. The word 'aparaa sthitih' is
understood here. This means that in the Ratnaprabha earth, the inferior state is
ten thousand years. 1. Taani Brahma- Mu. Ta. | 2. Rtate. Ath Bhavan- Aa. Fa. 1,

Chapter Five 8526. Now, the substance of the Jiva, among the objects of
Samyagdarshana, has been explained. Now, the substance of the Ajiva has been
considered, and in order to explain its names and distinctions, this sutra is
spoken. Dharma, Adharma, Akasha, and Pudgala are the Ajiva-kaya. ||1|| 8527. The
word 'kaya' is derived from the body. Here, it is applied by way of analogy.
What is the reason for this analogy? Just as the body is made up of the
accumulation of Pudgala substance, so also Dharma, etc., are called 'kaya'
because they are like bodies in terms of the accumulation of their regions.
Ajiva and kaya are in a karmadharaya compound, which is formed according to the
sutra 'visheshanam visheshyena'. Objection: In the case of 'neelotpala', etc.,
there is a difference between the qualifier and the qualified, and therefore,
the relationship between the qualifier and the qualified is established. But in
the case of Ajiva-kaya, what is the reason for establishing the relationship
between the qualifier and the qualified? Solution: In the case of Ajiva-kaya,
there is also a difference, because the word 'Ajiva' also exists in time, which
is not a kaya, and the word 'kaya' also exists in the Jiva. Why is the word
'kaya' used? It is used to indicate the multiplicity of regions. Dharma, etc.,
have many regions. Objection: It has already been stated that 'there are
countless regions of Dharma, Adharma, and the Jiva'. This itself indicates the
multiplicity of regions. Solution: That is true. But with this statement, it is
understood that the regions of Dharma, etc., are countless, not countable, and
not infinite. The word 'kaya' is used in this sutra to indicate that the
substance of time does not have an accumulation of regions. Time will be
explained later. To negate the regions of time, 1. Jainendra. 113148. 2. Satyam

202] [512 § 528 The term 'kāya' is used. Just as an atom, being only a point,
does not have any other points, and is therefore called 'apradesha' (without
parts), similarly, a time atom, being only one point, is also 'apradesha'. The
term 'ajīva' is a general term for dharma, etc., because they do not possess the
characteristics of a jīva. The terms 'dharma', 'adharma', 'ākāsha', and
'pudgala' are specific terms, which are compound. 8528. Here it is said, "In all
the transformations of substances, only..." etc. It is asked, what are the
substances mentioned in these sutras? The answer is: Dharma, adharma, ākāsha,
and pudgala are the substances. ||2|| 8529. The word 'dravya' is derived from
the root 'du', which means 'to obtain'. Therefore, the meaning of the word
'dravya' is that which is obtained by its own transformations, or which obtains
transformations. Doubt: Is 'dravya' a category, and is it called 'dravya'
because of its relation to this category? Answer: No, because this would not
prove both. Just as a stick and a stick-holder are both separately established,
and therefore their relation is established, similarly, 'dravya' and 'dravya-
tva' are not separately established. If, even though they are not separately
established, their relation is accepted, then the relation of a sky-flower and
the second head of a natural man would also have to be accepted. If you accept
their separate establishment, then the separate acceptance of 'dravya-tva' is
useless. Doubt: If you say that 'dravya' is a collection of qualities, then
also, in the absence of a difference between qualities and their collection, the
term 'dravya' would not be appropriate. If you accept a difference, then the
same fault arises as mentioned earlier. Doubt: If you say that 'dravya' is that
which is obtained by qualities, or which obtains qualities, then also the same
fault arises? Answer: No, because, in some cases there is a difference, and in
some cases there is no difference, and therefore the term 'dravya' is
established. Qualities and 'dravya' cannot exist without each other. 1. This is
not its fault. 2. Dharma, adharma, ākāsha, and pudgala are the substances. 3.
The second head of a natural man. 4. A collection of qualities is 'dravya'. 5.
The term 'dravya' is established. 6. It obtains. 7. It is obtained.

## Chapter Five: The Establishment of the Designation of Substance through the
Proof of Difference and Non-Difference  **Difference** is established due to the
non-perception of non-difference through the difference of designation,
characteristics, purpose, etc. **Non-difference** is established due to the non-
perception of difference.   **The substances** like Dharma, etc., are many,
hence the plural designation "dravyaani" is used to indicate their co-location.
**Objection:** Just as the number is repeated, the masculine gender should also
be repeated.  **Solution:** This is not a fault, because words with inherent
gender never deviate from their gender. Therefore, Dharma, etc., are substances.
**8530.** Due to the immediate succession, only four are designated as
substances. Therefore, this sutra is said to include the others.  **Jivas are
also substances. (3)**  **8531.** The word "jiva" has been explained. The plural
designation is used to indicate the different types of jiva substances. The word
"cha" is used to connect the jiva substances to the previous substances,
implying that jivas are also substances. Thus, these five, along with the time
to be mentioned later, become six substances.  **Objection:** The definition of
substance will be given later as "dravyaṁ guṇaparyayavat" (substance is that
which has qualities and modifications). Therefore, Dharma, etc., become
substances due to the characteristics of the definition, so why is there a need
for their separate enumeration?  **Solution:** The enumeration is for the
purpose of determination. This eliminates the substances like earth, etc., that
are assumed by other schools of thought.  **Objection:** How?  **Solution:**
Earth, water, fire, air, and mind are included in the pudgala substance, because
they have form, taste, smell, and touch.  **Objection:** Air and mind do not
have form, etc.  **Solution:** No, because air has form, etc., like a pot, due
to its tangibility.  **Objection:** Air is not perceived by the eye, etc.,
therefore it does not have form, etc.  **Solution:** No, because in the category
of atoms, etc.,

## 204] **Sapicity**  [5138531] There would be an **atiprasanga** (fallacy of
excessive implication) if we were to say that atoms are not perceived by the
senses like eyes, etc., and therefore they lack form, etc. Similarly, water is
fragrant because it is tangible, like earth. Fire also has taste and smell
because it has form, like earth. Mind is of two types: **dravya-mana** (material
mind) and **bhava-mana** (mental mind). Of these, **bhava-mana** is the essence
of knowledge, and knowledge is a quality of the soul, therefore it is included
within the soul. **Dravya-mana** has form, etc., and is therefore a modification
of **pudgala** (matter). Just as mind has form, etc., it is also an instrument
for the use of knowledge, like the eye sense.   **Objection:**  Since even
sound, which is intangible, is seen to be an instrument for the use of
knowledge, the argument used to prove that mind has form, etc., is
**vyabhichari** (fallacious).   **Solution:** No, because sound is
**paudgalika** (material), therefore it has the potential to be tangible.
**Objection:** Just as atoms are proven to have form, etc., because their
effects have form, etc., the effects of air and mind do not have form, etc.
**Solution:** No, because the effects of air and mind also have form, etc.,
because it is accepted that all atoms have the potential to produce all effects
that have form, etc. There are no atoms that are specifically of the earth,
etc., types, because we see the beginning of all things through the mixing of
types.   Similarly, direction is included within space, because there is a basis
for the usage of terms like "here" and "there" in relation to the regions of
space, based on the rising of the sun, etc.  **Special Note:** In relation to
types, all substances like souls, **pudgala**, etc., are called **dravya**
(substance). The word **dravya** has two meanings: **dravna-shila** (capable of
flowing) and **dhruva** (permanent). Every substance in the universe is both
capable of transformation and permanent, therefore it is called **dravya**. The
meaning is that every substance never violates its own qualities and
modifications. It has a fixed flow, based on which it continues to flow. The
word **dravya** is used in the Jain philosophy, and especially in the
Vaisheshika philosophy. In the Vaisheshika philosophy, a complete distinction is
made between **guna** (quality) and **gunin** (possessor of quality), **kriya**
(action) and **kriyavan** (possessor of action), and **samanya** (general) and
**vishesha** (particular). Therefore, it is **dravya** in relation to **dravya-
tva** (substance-ness). The word **dravya** has this meaning, but it does not
seem appropriate, because there is no independent substance called **dravya-
tva** that is experienced. This philosophy considers earth, water, fire, air, 1.

## Chapter Five  **532.** To explain the specific characteristics of the
substances mentioned, the following sutra is stated: The substances are eternal,
permanent, and formless. ||4||  **533.** The word "eternal" means permanent.
According to the *Vārtika* "ne dhve tyah", the word "nitya" is formed by adding
the suffix "ty" to the root "ni" in the sense of permanent. These six
substances, which are characterized by specific features like motion, cause,
etc. in relation to *paryāyāthika* (relating to the categories of existence),
and by general features like existence, etc. in relation to *dravyaāthika*
(relating to the categories of substance), never undergo destruction, hence they
are eternal. This will be further explained in the sutra "tad bhāva avyayam
nityam". Their number never changes, hence they are permanent. The six
substances, Dharma, etc., never exceed the number six, hence they are called
permanent. They do not possess form, hence they are formless. Here, only the
absence of form is stated, but since taste, etc. are its associates, their
absence is also implied. Therefore, formless means non-material.  **534.** Just
as the general characteristics of being eternal and permanent are applicable to
all substances, the characteristic of being formless is also applicable to
*pudgala*. Therefore, to explain the exception, the following sutra is stated:
*Pudgala* are formed. ||5||

[206] **Sarvarthasiddhi** [516 § 535 8535.  "Rupa" and "Murti" have the same
meaning. Question: What is "Murti"? Answer: "Murti" is the result of the
transformation of form and other aspects. Those who have form are called "Rupi".
This means "Murtiman". Alternatively, "Rupa" is a word that signifies a specific
quality. Those who have it are called "Rupi". Question: Why is "Rasa" etc. not
included here? Answer: Because "Rasa" etc. are inseparable from form, they are
included within it. The plural form "Pudgalah" is used to indicate the
difference. Pudgalas are different due to the difference in Skandha and
Paramanu. These differences in Pudgalas will be discussed later. If Pudgalas are
considered to be one and formless, like the Pradhan, it would contradict the
existence of the world as a manifestation. 8536. Question: Are all the
substances like Dharma etc. also different, like Pudgalas? The next Sutra
answers this: From Akasha to each substance is one. ||6|| 8537. "A" in this
Sutra signifies affirmation. This is said following the sequential order of the
Sutras. This includes Dharma, Adharma, and Akasha. The word "Ek" signifies
number. It qualifies the substance. This means that Dharma, Adharma, and Akasha
are each one substance. Question: If this is so, then why is the plural form
"Ekadravyaani" used in the Sutra? Answer: The plural form is used in relation to
Dharma etc. substances. Question: "Ek" has the power to signify many, so why not
just use "Ekak" instead of "Ekadravyaani"? This would make the Sutra shorter.
Also, the use of the word "Dravya" is pointless? Answer: The word "Dravya" is
used in the Sutra to indicate that these Dharma etc. substances are one in
relation to Dravya. This means that if only "Ekak" was used in the Sutra, it
would not be clear whether these Dharma etc. substances are one in relation to
Dravya, Kshetra, Kala, or Bhava. Therefore, "Ekadravyaani" is used to remove
this doubt. Among these, Dharma and Adharma have countless possibilities in
relation to Kshetra, and infinite possibilities in relation to Bhava.  / 1.

## Chapter Five: [207 **Taking Hold of the Subtle**  This [sutra] shows that the
multitude of jivas and pudgalas is not due to their being innumerable and
infinite in relation to the absence of a field, but rather due to the
desirability of infinite and innumerable variations.  8538. This is said for the
purpose of understanding the specific characteristics of the individual
substances that have been authorized. They are inactive. ||7||  8539. The
modification that arises from both internal and external causes is called
action, which is the cause of a substance's attainment of a different field.
Those that are devoid of such action are inactive. Here it is argued: If dharma,
etc., are inactive substances, then their production would not occur. For the
production of pots, etc., is seen to be preceded by action. And without
production, there would be no destruction. Therefore, the concept of all
substances having production, etc., as their three characteristics is
contradicted? No, because there is another explanation. Even in the absence of
production caused by action, the production of dharma, etc., is conceived of in
another way. For example, there are two types of production: self-caused and
caused by another's modification. Self-caused production is accepted on the
basis of the authority of the scriptures, which state that there are infinite
subtle and gross qualities in every substance, which, due to their being located
in the six places, are constantly undergoing increase and decrease. Therefore,
their production and destruction are natural. Similarly, there is also
production and destruction caused by another's modification. For example,
dharma, etc., are the causes of the movement, rest, and immersion of horses,
etc. Since there is a difference in these movements, etc., from moment to
moment, their causes must also be different. Thus, production and destruction
are attributed to dharma, etc., in relation to another's modification.  It is
argued: If dharma, etc., are inactive, then they cannot be the cause of the
movement, etc., of jivas and pudgalas. For water, etc., are active, and they are
seen to be the cause of the movement, etc., of fish, etc., otherwise not? This
is not a fault.

208] Sarvarthasiddhi [5188540] Because of being a mere instrument, like the eye.
Just as the eye is a mere instrument in the perception of form, so also it is
not the case that a distracted mind can perceive form even in the presence of
the eye. When the inactivity of the substances of dharma, adharma, and space is
accepted, the activity of jiva and pudgala is obtained from the meaning. But if
it is said that time is also active? No; because it has no authority here.
Therefore, it is not authorized along with these. $ 540. In the phrase
"ajivakaya", the word "kaya" indicates only the existence of regions, not the
number of regions determined by them. Therefore, to determine that, the next
sutra is said: There are innumerable regions of dharma, adharma, and one jiva.
||8|| 8541. Those that are beyond number are called innumerable. Innumerable is
of three types - jghanya, utkrisht, and ajghanyotkrisht. Here, the
ajghanyotkrisht innumerable is taken. "Pradisyante iti pradesah" is the
etymology of the word "pradesh". The meaning is that what gives a sign of the
developed mana is called a pradesh. The characteristics of the paramanu will be
explained later. The region in which it resides is called a pradesh. The number
of regions of dharma, adharma, and one jiva is equal. Of these, dharma and
adharma substances are inactive and spread throughout the lokakasha. Although
the regions of jiva are equal to the dharma and adharma substances, it is still
capable of contraction and expansion, so it resides in the extent of the body,
small or large, obtained due to karma. And at the time of the kevalisamudghata,
when it pervades the entire loka, the eight middle regions of jiva are situated
in the middle of the vajra-like plate of the chitra earth, below the Meru
mountain, and the remaining regions pervade the entire loka, above, below, and
diagonally. This is not a fault, because like the eye sense, these are mere
instruments in the force. Just as the eye sense is a mere instrument in the
perception of form, so also it is not the case that a distracted mind can
perceive form even in the presence of the eye. In the same way, it should be
understood in the present context. Thus, when the inactivity of the substances
of dharma, adharma, and space is accepted, the activity of jiva and pudgala is
obtained from the meaning. Doubt - Will the substance of time also be active? No
- No; because it has no authority here. Therefore, it is not authorized along
with these substances. 5540. In the phrase "ajivakaya", the word "kaya"

explained. Now, the regions of the material pudgalas need to be understood.
Therefore, the following sutra states: **Pudgalas have countable, uncountable,
and infinite regions.** ||10||  **8545.** The word "and" implies that there are
infinite regions. For some pudgala substances, like a dyad, there are countable
regions, while for others, there are uncountable and infinite regions.
**Question:** Should we consider the concept of "infinitely infinite" here?
**Answer:** No, because here we are considering the general concept of infinity.
There are three types of infinity: parita-ananta (limited infinity), yukta-
ananta (combined infinity), and ananta-ananta (infinitely infinite). All of
these are encompassed by the general concept of infinity. **Question:** If the
universe has uncountable regions, then it would be the substratum for both the
infinite-region and infinitely infinite-region skandhas, leading to a
contradiction. Therefore, pudgalas cannot have infinite regions. **Answer:**
This is not a valid objection, because due to the ability to undergo subtle
transformations and the power of penetration, the pudgala skandhas with infinite
or infinitely infinite regions can exist within space. Subtle, transformed,
infinitely infinite atoms reside within each region of space. Their power of
penetration is unimpeded. Therefore, the existence of infinitely infinite atoms
within a single region does not lead to a contradiction.

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):  [210] In Sarvārthasiddhi: [5111]
Due to the use of the general term 'pudgalānām' in the previous sūtra, there
arises the implication that even the atoms (aṇus) have spatial parts. To refute
this, the following sūtra is stated:  Atoms (aṇus) do not have spatial parts.
॥1॥ [6547] The remaining part of the sentence is 'spatial parts do not exist'.
Why do they not exist? Because atoms are of the nature of a single spatial part.
Just as in the case of the single space-point (ākāśa-pradeśa), there is no
division of spatial parts, similarly, due to the atoms being of the nature of a
single spatial part, there is no division of spatial parts. Moreover, there is
no other substance smaller than the atom, so that its spatial parts could be
designated.  [8548] To establish the substratum (ādhāra) of the aforementioned
attributes (dharmādi) that are devoid of spatial parts, the following sūtra is
stated:  The incorporation (avagāha) of the dharmādi substances is in the loka-
ākāśa (cosmic space). ॥12॥ [8549] The meaning is that the incorporation of the
mentioned dharmādi substances is not outside the loka-ākāśa. If the dharmādi
substances have the loka-ākāśa as their substratum, then what is the substratum
of the ākāśa? The ākāśa has no other substratum; it is self-established (sva-
pratiṣṭha). If the ākāśa is self-established, then the dharmādi substances are
also self-established. If another substratum is imagined for the dharmādi
substances, then another substratum would also have to be imagined for the
ākāśa. This would lead to an infinite regress. But this is not a defect, because
there is no substance with a greater dimension than the ākāśa in which the ākāśa
could be said to be situated. The ākāśa is infinite in all directions. However,
the ākāśa is spoken of as the substratum (ādhāraṇa) of the dharmādi substances
due to the perspective of the vyavahāra-naya (empirical viewpoint). From the
standpoint of the evam-bhūta-naya (the perspective of the true nature), all
substances are self-established. As it is said, "Where do you reside? Within the
self." The conclusion is that the dharmādi substances are not outside the loka-
ākāśa, and this is the fruit of the conception of the substratum-substrate
(ādhārādheyakalpanā) established here.

## Chapter Five  [21i] Just as the seeds of the *badari* tree are seen in a
well, so too is the *lokaakasha* not seen in the same way as the *dharma* and
other substances that are born later. Therefore, even from the perspective of
practical reasoning, the concept of a base and a dependent does not hold true,
does it? This is not a fault, because even in things that exist simultaneously,
the relationship of base and dependent is seen. For example, form and other
qualities are in a pot, and hands and other limbs are in the body. Now, the
nature of *loka* is explained.   **Question:** What is *loka*?  **Answer:**
Where *dharma* and other substances are located, that is called *loka*. The word
*loka* is derived from the root *lok* with the suffix *ghan* in the sense of
location.  *Aakasha* is of two types: *lokaakasha* and *alokaakasha*. *Loka* has
already been explained. The *aakasha* where *loka* is found is called
*lokaakasha*. Beyond that, in all directions, is the infinite *alokaakasha*.
The division between *loka* and *aloka* is to be understood in terms of the
existence and non-existence of the *dharmaastikaya* and *adharmaastikaya*. If
the *dharmaastikaya* does not exist, then there would be no basis for the rules
governing the movement of *jiva* and *pudgala*, and therefore no division
between *loka* and *aloka*. Similarly, if the *adharmaastikaya* does not exist,
then there would be no basis for the existence of *jiva* and *pudgala*, leading
to their non-existence and consequently, no division between *loka* and *aloka*.
Therefore, the existence and non-existence of both the *dharmaastikaya* and
*adharmaastikaya* establish the division between *loka* and *aloka*.  8550.
Since there can be a difference in the location of the substances that are
mentioned in *lokaakasha*, the next *sutra* is stated to explain the specific
location of each substance:  "The *dharma* and *adharma* substances are
completely immersed in *lokaakasha*." [13]  8551. The word "completely" in the
*sutra* is used to show that the *dharma* and *adharma* substances are present
throughout the entire *lokaakasha*. Just as a pot is located in a house, the
*dharma* and *adharma* substances are not located in *lokaakasha* in the same
way. Rather, they are present in *lokaakasha* like oil in sesame seeds. This
means that they are present in every part of *lokaakasha*.  **Doubt:** The
relationship of base and dependent is seen only in those things that are born
before and after in *loka*. For example, the well is the base for the *badari*
seeds. Similarly, if *aakasha* is born before and the *dharma* and other
substances are born later, then this is not the case. Therefore, even from the
perspective of practical reasoning, the concept of a base and a dependent does
not hold true, does it?  **Solution:** This is not a fault, because even in
things that exist simultaneously, the relationship of base and dependent is
seen. For example, form and other qualities are in a pot, and hands and other
limbs are in the body.

## 212] Sarvarthasiddhi  [51148552 - The absence of obstruction is to be known
due to the power of penetration. $ 552. Therefore, to explain the special
penetration of the pudgalas, which are material, non-spatial, countable,
uncountable, and infinite in number, the following sutra is stated: The
penetration of pudgalas is to be considered as being in one space, etc. ||14|| 8
553. One space is one space. Those whose beginning is one space are called one
space, etc. In them, the penetration of pudgalas is to be considered as
optional. "The whole is the sum of its parts"3, therefore, even one space is
considered. For example, the penetration of an atom in one space of the sky. Two
atoms, bound or unbound, in one space or in two spaces. Three atoms, bound or
unbound, in one, two, or three spaces. In this way, the penetration of the
skandhas, which are countable, uncountable, and infinite in number, in one,
countable, and uncountable spaces of the loka-akasha, is to be understood. Now,
it is reasonable that the non-material dharma and adharma can exist in one place
without obstruction. But how can the material pudgalas exist in one place
without obstruction? The answer is that due to their penetrative nature and
subtle transformation, the material pudgalas do not obstruct each other in their
penetration, just as the light of many lamps can exist in one lampshade. This is
also to be understood from the authority of the scriptures. It is said: "The

-51168557 Chapter Five [213 8554. Now, how the avagāha of jīvas is, that is
explained. The avagāha of jīvas is in the countless parts, etc., of the loka-
ākāśa. ||15|| 8555. 'Loka-ākāśe' is understood here. One part of that which is
divided into countless parts is called a countless part. That is the beginning
of those which are countless parts, etc. In them, the avagāha of jīvas is to be
known. For example, one jīva resides in one countless part. In this way, the
avagāha of one jīva is to be known from two, three, four, etc., countless parts
up to the entire loka. But the avagāha of many jīvas is in the entire loka. If
one jīva resides in one countless part, how can an infinite number of jīvas with
bodies reside in the loka-ākāśa according to the measure of dravya? The answer
is that their residence is to be understood due to the difference between subtle
and gross. The gross jīvas have bodies with resistance. The subtle jīvas,
although they have bodies, are subtle, and therefore, even in the space that one
nigoda jīva avagāhas, an infinite number of jīvas with ordinary bodies reside.
They do not collide with each other or with the gross jīvas, so there is no
conflict in the avagāha of an infinite number of jīvas in the loka-ākāśa. 556.
Here, it is said that the space of one jīva is equal to the loka-ākāśa. How can
it reside in the countless parts, etc., of the loka? It should be that it
pervades the entire loka. To this, it is said: Like a lamp, due to the
contraction and expansion of the space of jīvas. ||16|| 8557. Because the soul
is of an immaterial nature, due to its eternal bondage, it somehow takes on a
material form. 1. Even though it has a body, A., Di. 1, Di. 2. 2. -Even though
it avagāhas, Mu.

[214] Sarvarthasiddhi [5117 $ 558] Due to the influence of karma, the body
resides in the gross and subtle forms. Due to the influence of karma, the nature
of contraction and expansion of space is present. Therefore, it is reasonable
that the soul resides in countless parts of the universe, like a lamp. Just as a
lamp, even though its light is not limited by space, is limited by a cover, a
shell, or other coverings, so too, the soul is limited by karma.   **Question:**
Since dharma and other substances interpenetrate each other, wouldn't they
become one?  **Answer:** No, even though they are in close contact with each
other, they do not lose their individual nature. As it is said:  "All substances
interpenetrate each other, giving space to each other, and always remaining
together, yet they do not abandon their own nature." 8558  **Since it is said
that dharma and other substances have different natures, the next sutra
states:**  "Motion and rest are the functions of dharma and adharma
respectively." 17. 8559  **Explanation:** Motion is the cause of reaching
another place. Rest is the opposite of motion. "Upgraha" means "function" and is
derived from the root "upgrihyate." "Gati-sthiti" is a compound word meaning
"motion and rest." Motion and rest are the functions, hence the sutra states
"Gati-sthiti-upgraha." "Dharma-adharmayo" is in the sixth case, indicating the
agent. "Upkara" means "function" and is derived from the root "upkriyate."
**Question:** What is this function?  **Answer:** The function of motion and the
function of rest are the functions.  **Question:** If this is the case, then the
dual number is implied.  **Answer:** This is not a fault, because a word that is
used in a general sense, even though it is connected to another word, does not
lose its original number. For example, "Saadhoh karyaam tapahshruthe."
**Therefore, it is said that:**  The dharma-kaya is the common support for the
souls and pudgalas that are undergoing the results of motion, like fish in
water. Similarly, the dharma-kaya is the common support for the souls and
pudgalas that are undergoing the results of rest.

[5117 § 559] [215 The earth element is the common substratum for the stationary
state of living beings and pudgalas, just as the earth is the substratum for the
stationary state of horses, etc. **Objection:** The term "substratum" is
redundant, as "benefit" would suffice. For example, "motion and rest are the
benefits of dharma and adharma." **Solution:** This is not a flaw; the term
"substratum" is used to clarify the order. Just as there is an order between
dharma and adharma, motion and rest, so too is there an order in the way living
beings and pudgalas receive the benefit of dharma. The benefit of dharma is the
motion of living beings, and the benefit of adharma is the stationary state of
pudgalas. The term "substratum" is used to clarify this order. **Objection:**
The benefit of dharma and adharma is attributed to space, as it is omnipresent.
**Solution:** This is incorrect, as space has other benefits. The purpose of
space is to permeate all substances, including dharma, etc. If one substance is
attributed with multiple purposes, then there would be no distinction between
the world and the non-world. **Objection:** The benefits of dharma and adharma
can be attributed to earth, water, etc., as they are capable of performing these
functions. Therefore, it is not appropriate to attribute them to dharma and
adharma. **Solution:** No, because it has been specifically stated that dharma
and adharma are the common causes of motion and rest. Moreover, one action can
be caused by multiple factors. **Objection:** Dharma and adharma are equally
powerful, so they should restrict each other's motion and rest. **Solution:**
No, because they are not motivating factors. **Objection:** Dharma and adharma
do not exist, as they are not perceivable, like the horns of a donkey.
**Solution:** No, because all proponents agree on this. The point is that all
proponents accept both perceivable and non-perceivable objects. Therefore, their
non-existence cannot be asserted. Secondly, the argument of "non-perceivability"
is invalid against us Jains, because we have the eye of omniscience, which is
the direct knowledge of the attributes of things. 1. Chapter Five The phrase
"karma is penance" has "karma" in the singular and "penance" in the dual. This
should be understood in the context of the present discussion. The meaning of
this sutra is that just as water is the common cause for the motion of fish, so
too are dharma and adharma the common causes for the motion of living beings and
pudgalas. Similarly, just as the earth is the common cause for the stationary
state of horses, etc., so too are adharma and adharma the common causes for the
stationary state of living beings and pudgalas. **Objection:** The term
"substratum" is redundant in the sutra, as "benefit" would suffice. For example,
"motion and rest are the benefits of dharma and adharma." **Solution:** This is
not a flaw; the term "substratum" is used to clarify the order. Just as there is
an order between dharma and adharma, motion and rest, so too is there an order
in the way living beings and pudgalas receive the benefit of dharma. The benefit
of dharma is the motion of living beings, and the benefit of adharma is the

Secondly, the argument of "non-perceivability" is invalid against us Jains,
because we have the eye of omniscience, which is the direct knowledge of the
attributes of things. 1.  It is indeed proven. 2.  It is refuted. 3.  It is
refuted by the proponents.

[216] Sarvarthasiddhi [51188560] All things are perceived by the omniscient God
with the eye of perfect direct knowledge. They are also known by those who have
scriptural knowledge through His teachings. 8560. Here it is said, if the
existence of the non-sensory dharma and adharma substances is accepted due to
their relationship with benefit, then what is the benefit of the non-sensory
space, which is mentioned next? Space provides room for movement. ||18|| 8561.
The word 'benefit' is repeated. The benefit of space is to be understood as
providing room for the movement of living beings and pudgalas. It is said, it is
appropriate to provide room for the movement of living beings and pudgalas, who
are active. But how can dharma and other substances, which are inactive and
eternally connected, be considered as providing room for movement? No, this is
established by convention. Just as space is said to be all-pervasive even though
it does not move, because it is present everywhere, similarly, even though there
is no action of providing room for movement in dharma and adharma substances,
they are present everywhere in the space of the universe, therefore they are
considered as providing room for movement. It is said, if providing room for
movement is the nature of space, then why is there a collision of vajra, loha,
etc. with bhitti, etc. and of cows, etc. with walls, etc.? But collision is
seen. Therefore, it is clear that providing room for movement is not the nature
of space. This is not a fault, because vajra and loha, etc. are gross
substances, therefore they collide with each other, hence the ability of space
to provide room for movement is not lost. The collision that is seen here is
only of the substances that provide room for movement. The meaning is that
vajra, etc. are gross substances, therefore they do not provide room for
movement to each other, this is not a fault of space. However, the pudgalas,
which are subtle, provide room for movement to each other. It is said, if this
is so, then this is not a unique characteristic of space, because it is also
present in other substances. No, because all substances...

## Chapter Five  [217]  There is no fault in saying that this is an
extraordinary characteristic for the purpose of general understanding, because
it is found in other substances as well.   **Objection:** But in the absence of
light and space, there is no absence of that (i.e., space).   **Solution:** No,
because it does not abandon its own nature.  8562. The benefit of space has been
stated. Now, it is said what is the benefit of the pudgalas mentioned
thereafter:  **"Body, speech, mind, and pranapana are the benefits of
pudgalas."** ||19||  8563. **Objection:** This is inappropriate.   **Counter-
objection:** What is inappropriate?   **Objection:** The question was what is
the benefit of pudgalas, but in the answer, it is said that "body, etc., are
made of pudgalas," thus stating the characteristics of pudgalas.   **Solution:**
This is not inappropriate, because the characteristics of pudgalas will be
stated later. This sutra is only meant to state the benefit of pudgalas towards
jivas, hence it is stated in the context of benefit.   The five bodies have
already been mentioned. They are subtle and not perceptible to the senses. But
the upayaya bodies that are obtained due to their arising, some are perceptible
to the senses and some are beyond the senses. The karmas that are the cause of
these five bodies are also grasped by the grasping of the body.   It is said
that all these bodies are pudgalic, and thus pudgalas benefit jivas.
**Objection:** Like space, karmic bodies do not have any form, therefore it is
not appropriate to consider them pudgalic. Yes, it is appropriate to consider
the five bodies, which have form, as pudgalic.   **Solution:** This is not
correct, because karmic bodies are also pudgalic, because their result is due to
their connection with material objects. It is clearly seen that rice, etc.,
which are cooked due to their connection with water, etc., are pudgalic.
Similarly, karmic bodies also become cooked when they come in contact with
material objects like sugar, thorns, etc., therefore they are pudgalic.

[218] **Sarvarthasiddhi** [51198 563] It is to be understood that speech is of
two types: **dravya-vacana** (material speech) and **bhava-vacana** (mental
speech).   **Bhava-vacana** is **paudgalika** (composed of pudgalas) because it
is caused by the destruction and pacification of **virya-antaraya** (obstacles
to energy), **mati-jnana-avaran** (veil of knowledge), and **sruta-jnana-
avaran** (veil of scriptural knowledge) karmas, as well as the **anga-upanga**
(limbs and sub-limbs) karmas. In the absence of pudgalas, **bhava-vacana** would
not exist.  **Dravya-vacana** is also **paudgalika** because pudgalas, driven by
the soul with its inherent capacity for action, transform into speech. This is
further confirmed by the fact that **dravya-vacana** is the object of the
auditory sense.  **Question:** Why is speech not the object of other senses?
**Answer:** Because it is not suitable for their perception, just as the scent
of a fragrant substance is not perceived by the taste sense.  **Question:** Is
speech immaterial?  **Answer:** No, because speech is perceived by the senses,
it is obstructed by material objects, it is disrupted by adverse winds, and it
is overpowered by other factors. This proves that speech is material.  **Mind**
is also of two types: **dravya-mana** (material mind) and **bhava-mana** (mental
mind).   **Bhava-mana** is **paudgalika** because it is characterized by
perception and use, and it depends on pudgalas.  **Dravya-mana** is also
**paudgalika** because pudgalas, which are conducive to the soul's well-being by
facilitating the destruction and pacification of **jnana-avaran** (veil of
knowledge) and **virya-antaraya** karmas, as well as the **anga-upanga** karmas,
and by enabling the soul to contemplate virtues and vices, remember, and engage
in other activities, transform into mind.  **Question:** Some argue that mind is
a separate substance, devoid of transformations like form, and is merely an
atom. Therefore, it is not **paudgalika**.  **Answer:** This argument is
incorrect. Why? Let's examine it. This mind is either connected to the soul and
the senses or unconnected. If it is unconnected, it cannot benefit the soul, nor
can it serve as an advisor to the senses. If it is connected, then the atom of
mind connected to one location cannot benefit other locations.  **Question:**
Could it be that this mind, like a spinning wheel, moves around all locations
due to the influence of an unseen force?  **Answer:** No, because the unseen
force lacks such capacity. The unseen force, being immaterial and inactive,
cannot initiate action elsewhere. However, a specific type of air, which is
**paudgalika**, is capable of doing so.  Similarly, the **karman** body, like a
physical body, produces results when it comes into contact with material objects
like sugar and thorns. This indicates that the **karman** body is also
**paudgalika**.

## Chapter Five  [219] The A-dṛṣṭa is not the cause of action because it is not
active and does not have the characteristic of touch, whereas the wind, being
active and having the characteristic of touch, is the cause of pulsation in
plants. The A-dṛṣṭa is the opposite of this. The wind that is expelled from the
body by the soul, which is seeking the destruction of the obstacles to power,
the destruction of the veil of knowledge, and the rise of the karma of the limbs
and the limbs of the limbs, is called Prāṇa, which is characterized by
inhalation. The wind that is drawn into the body by the soul is called Apāna,
which is characterized by exhalation. Thus, Prāṇa and Apāna are also beneficial
to the soul, because they are the cause of life. These three, namely, mind,
Prāṇa, and Apāna, are material because their obstruction, etc., is seen by
material things. The obstruction of the mind is seen by things that cause fear,
such as lightning strikes. It is also seen by things that overwhelm it, such as
alcohol. The obstruction of Prāṇa and Apāna is experienced by covering the mouth
with the palms of the hands, cloth, etc., and by phlegm. The immaterial cannot
be obstructed by material things. Therefore, the existence of the soul is
established. Just as the movements of a mechanical image indicate the existence
of its operator, so too, the actions of Prāṇa, Apāna, etc., indicate the
existence of the active soul. 8564. Whether this is the only benefit of the
Pudgala or there is another benefit, is explained in the next sūtra:
**Happiness, sorrow, life, and death are also benefits of the Pudgala.** [20]
$565. The result that arises from the ripening of external substances, etc., due
to the internal cause of the rise of the Sāta and Asāta, is called happiness and
sorrow, which are in the form of pleasure and pain. The karma of life, which is
the cause of existence, arises from the soul's A-dṛṣṭa. Therefore, this A-dṛṣṭa
is also inactive and therefore unable to initiate action elsewhere. It is seen
that the particular substance called wind is itself active and has the
characteristic of touch, and is the cause of pulsation in plants, but the
A-dṛṣṭa is the opposite of this, and therefore cannot be the cause of action.
The soul, which is seeking the destruction of the obstacles to power, the
destruction of the veil of knowledge, and the rise of the karma of the limbs and
the limbs of the limbs, expels the wind from the body, which is called Prāṇa,
which is characterized by inhalation. The same soul draws the wind into the
body, which is called Apāna, which is characterized by exhalation. Thus, these
Prāṇa and Apāna are also beneficial to the soul, because they are the cause of
life. These three, namely, mind, Prāṇa, and Apāna, are material because their
obstruction, etc., is seen by material things. For example, the obstruction of
the mind is seen by things that cause fear, such as lightning strikes. It is
also seen by things that overwhelm it, such as alcohol. The obstruction of Prāṇa
and Apāna is experienced by covering the mouth with the palms of the hands,

things. This indicates that they are all material. And from this, the existence

{220} In the state of **sarvārṣasiddhi**, the cessation of the specific actions
of **prāṇa** and **apāna** as described earlier, for a living being who is in
the state of **sthiti** (existence), is called **jīvita** (life). The cessation
of this is **maraṇa** (death). These things like happiness, etc., are the
benefits that a living being receives from **pudgala**; because they arise only
when the material causes are present.   **Question:** Since the topic is about
benefits, why is the word **upagraha** (dependence) used in the sūtra?
**Answer:** It is not unnecessary. The word **upagraha** is used in the sūtra to
show the benefits that are received from oneself. **Pudgala** also receive
benefits from **pudgala**. For example, **kāsa** (bronze) etc. are benefited by
**bhasma** (ashes) etc., **jala** (water) etc. are benefited by **kataka** (a
type of stone) etc., and **ayaḥ** (iron) etc. are benefited by **udaka** (water)
etc.   **Question:** What is the purpose of the word **ca** (and) in the sūtra?
**Answer:** It is for the purpose of **samuccaya** (collection). It is used to
indicate that there are other benefits that are received from **pudgala**. For
example, just as the body is a benefit received from **pudgala**, so are the
senses like the eyes, etc.   8566. Having shown the benefits received from non-
living beings, the next sūtra shows the benefits received from living beings:
**Paraspuropagraho jīvānām ||21||** (Mutual dependence is the benefit of living
beings.)  8567. The word **paraspura** (mutual) is used in the sense of
**karmavyatihara** (interaction of karma). **Karmavyatihara** is the same as
**kriyāvyatihara** (interaction of actions). **Paraspura**'s **upagraha** is
**paraspuropagraha** (mutual dependence). This is the benefit of living beings.
**Question:** What is the benefit?   **Answer:** The relationship of **svāmī**
(master) and **bhṛtya** (servant), **ācārya** (teacher) and **śiṣya** (student),
etc., is **paraspuropagraha**. The **svāmī** benefits the **bhṛtya** by giving
him wealth, etc. The **bhṛtya** benefits the **svāmī** by speaking the truth and
forbidding what is harmful. The **ācārya** benefits the **śiṣya** by giving him
teachings that lead to happiness in both worlds and by making him perform
actions according to those teachings. The **śiṣya** benefits the **ācārya** by
behaving in a way that is pleasing to him.   **Question:** Since there is a
benefit, why is the word **upagraha** used again in the sūtra?   **Answer:**
Because of the previous 1. **kāraḥ** (cause).   **Question:** Why?   **Answer:**
Because of **mūrti** (form) and **ā** (existence).   **Question:** Why?
**Answer:** Because of **-yāṇām kṛtopa** (benefits received from).

Chapter Five: On the Subject of Benefit, Why is the Term "Upgraha" Repeated?
The term "Upgraha" is repeated to demonstrate the fourfold nature of happiness,
as mentioned earlier. The implication is that happiness, etc., are benefits
bestowed upon living beings by other living beings.  **Specific Point:** In this
section on benefit, the focus is on which substance benefits another and how.
Therefore, the question arises: Can one substance benefit or harm another,
distinct substance? If so, why is theism rejected in Jain philosophy? It is a
well-established principle that the qualities and modes of one substance cannot
enter another, distinct substance. Therefore, the idea that one substance can
benefit another, distinct substance, becomes a matter of consideration.  Those
philosophies that accept theism consider God as the efficient cause of every
action. They argue that beings are ignorant and not masters of their own
happiness and sorrow. They go to heaven or hell due to God's will. While it is
acknowledged that beings experience these heavenly and hellish states, it is
believed that God has a significant role in their attainment. If God desires, He
can prevent beings from entering these states. If one substance is considered
beneficial to another, then it would be tantamount to not rejecting theism. If
this section on benefit has a different meaning, then its philosophical analysis
is crucial. This point is further elaborated upon below.  All substances in the
world possess their own qualities and modes. From the perspective of substance,
they remain the same as they were in the infinite past, are the same today, and
will remain the same in the future. However, from the perspective of modes, they
are constantly changing. This change occurs within the limits of the substance.
This is the nature of every substance. Therefore, any outcome that occurs in a
substance is due to its own inherent capacity. A worldly being, bound by the
substance of matter, attains liberation in due course, also due to its own
inherent capacity. However, external factors are considered instrumental in the
occurrence of this action, based on the inherent capacity of each substance. For
example, a child has the capacity to learn, and when provided with the
instrumentality of a teacher, books, etc., he becomes learned. Therefore, the
teacher, etc., are instrumental in his learning. However, upon deeper
reflection, it becomes clear that the teacher or books, etc., did not create
intelligence in the child's soul. If these external factors had the capacity to
create intelligence, then the teacher could have instilled intelligence in all
the children who study under him. However, we observe that some remain foolish,
some become moderately knowledgeable, and some become highly knowledgeable. On
the one hand, a child cannot learn without a teacher, and on the other hand, if
the child does not have the capacity to develop intelligence, then even with the
teacher's best efforts, he will remain foolish. This shows that the teacher is
instrumental in the creation of the action, but not the ultimate cause. In the
belief in God, emphasis is placed on the role of the ultimate cause, while in
this section on benefit, external instrumentality is acknowledged but not
considered the ultimate cause. This is the intention behind the inclusion of
this section on benefit.

[222] Sarvarthasiddhi [51228568568. It is said that if it is necessary to be a
benefactor of the existent, then time is also considered to be existent.
Therefore, what is the benefit of time? This is explained in the following
sutra: Vartana, parinaama, kriyaa, paratva and aparatva are the benefits of
time. ||22|| 8569. The word vartana is formed by adding the suffix 'yut' to the
root 'vrt' (to exist) in the feminine gender, which means 'that which exists' or
'mere existence'. Although dharma and other substances are themselves engaged in
producing their own new modifications, their activity cannot occur without an
external cooperating cause. Therefore, time is considered to be the cause of
their activity, and this is called the benefit of vartana. Question: What is the
meaning of 'nij'? Answer: The modification of the substance changes, and time is
the one who changes it. Question: If this is the case, then time becomes an
active substance? For example, the student studies, and the teacher teaches.
(Here, the teacher is an active substance.) Answer: This is not a fault, because
even in the case of a mere cause, the designation of a cause-agent is seen. For
example, "The fire of the firewood teaches." In the same way, time is also a
cause-agent. Question: How is time known? Answer: Even though there are specific
actions like time, etc., and the cooking, etc., which are produced by time,
etc., have their own established names like time, cooking, etc., the attribution
of the name 'time' to them in the form of 'time is time', 'cooked rice is time',
etc., indicates the existence of the main time, which is the cause of that name,
because the secondary usage depends on the primary. The modification of a
substance, which is the cessation of one dharma and the production of another
dharma, and which is devoid of any change, is called parinaama. For example,
anger, etc., in a jiva, and color, etc., in pudgala. In the same way, there is
parinaama in the substances of dharma, adharma, aakasha and kaala, which are the
qualities of aguru, laghu, etc. (1. -yate vartate vartana- Mu. 2. Kaarishagni-

## Chapter Five  [5123 8570]  **[223]**  A substance is generated by increase
and decrease. The transformation of a substance in the form of *parispanda* is
called *kriya*. It is of two types, based on the difference between *prayogika*
and *vaisrashika*. *Prayogika* is the action of a cart, etc., while
*vaisrashika* is the action of a cloud, etc.  There are two types of *paratva*
and *apatva*: *kshetrakrta* and *kalakrta*. The present chapter deals with
*kalakrta* *paratva* and *apatva*, as it is a topic of *kalopkaraprakarana*. All
these *vartana* etc. *upkaras* indicate the existence of time.  **Objection:**
It is sufficient to accept only the term *vartana* in the sutra. The *parinama*
etc. are its differentiations, so their separate acceptance is meaningless.
**Solution:** The separate acceptance of *parinama* etc. is not meaningless,
because it is a detailed explanation to indicate two types of time. Time is of
two types: *paramarthakala* and *vyavaharakala*. *Paramarthakala* is
characterized by *vartana*, while *vyavaharakala* is characterized by *parinama*
etc.  The meaning is that a particular *kriya* which is delimited by another and
is the cause of delimitation of another, is called time in this way. It exists
in three forms: *bhuta*, *vartaman*, and *bhavishyat*. In *paramarthakala*, the
term *kala* is primary, while the terms *bhuta* etc. are secondary. In
*vyavaharakala*, the terms *bhuta* etc. are primary, while the term *kala* is
secondary, because this type of usage is with respect to a substance having
*kriya* and is the function of time.  Here, the objector says that the *upkaras*
of the substances *dharma*, *adharma*, *akasha*, *pudgala*, *jiva*, and *kala*
have been stated. Their *lakshana* has also been stated by the sutra " *upayogo
lakshanam* " etc. Similarly, the general *lakshana* of *pudgalas* has also been
stated by the sutra " *ajivakaya* " etc., but their specific *lakshana* has not
been stated. Therefore, the next sutra says:  **[23]** *Sparsha, rasa, gandha,
and varna* are the *pudgalas*.  **[8570]** That which is touched or the mere act
of touching is called *sparsha*. It is of eight types: *mridu*, *kathina*,
*guru*, *laghu*, *sita*, *ushna*, *snigdha*, and *ruksha*. That which is tasted
or the mere act of tasting is called *rasa*. It is of five types: *tikta*,
*amla*, *katu*, *madhura*, and *kashaya*.

## 224] Sarvarthasiddhi [5124 6 571] That which is smelled or is merely the
quality of smell is called *gandha*. It is of two types: *surabhi* (pleasant)
and *durabhi* (unpleasant). That which is seen or is merely the quality of sight
is called *varna*. It is of five types: *krishna* (black), *nila* (blue), *pita*
(yellow), *shukla* (white), and *lohita* (red). These are the primary types, and
each of them has countless, innumerable, and infinite variations.  *Sparsha*
(touch), *rasa* (taste), *gandha* (smell), and *varna* (color) are called
*sparsha-rasa-gandha-varna-vanta* because they possess these qualities. The
*matup* suffix is used to indicate their eternal connection with *pudgala*
dravya. For example, "Kshirinah Nyagrodhah" (the banyan tree is milky). In the
sutra "Manubaspinah Pudgalah", the *pudgalas* are described as having form, and
it has been explained that *rasa* etc. are always associated with form.
Therefore, based on this sutra, it is established that *pudgalas* possess form,
etc. So, is this sutra redundant? No, this is not a flaw. In the sutra
"Nityavasthitanyarupaani", the eternal nature of *dharma* etc. is established,
which implies that *pudgalas* are formless. To address this contradiction, the
sutra "Rupinah Pudgalah" is stated. However, this sutra is meant to explain the
specific nature of *pudgalas*.  8571. This sutra is stated to explain the
remaining *vikara* (modifications) of *pudgalas*. They are: *shabda* (sound),
*bandha* (bond), *saukshmya* (subtlety), *sthulya* (grossness), *samsthana*
(arrangement), *andhakara* (darkness), *chhaya* (shadow), *atapas* (heat), and
*udyota* (radiance). ||24||  8572. *Shabda* is of two types: *bhasharupa*
(linguistic) and *abhasharupa* (non-linguistic). *Bhasharupa* *shabda* is of two
types: *sakshara* (literate) and *anaksara* (illiterate). *Sakshara* *shabda* is
used in scriptures and for communication between Aryans and Mlechchas. It
includes Sanskrit and its opposite. *Anakshara* *shabda* is used to convey the
nature of extraordinary knowledge of two senses and other beings. Both types of
*shabda* are *prayogika* (practical). *Abhasharupa* *shabda* is of two types: 1.
*surabhi-durabhi* (pleasant-unpleasant) etc. 2. *van-nirdhesha* (indication of
possession) etc. *Man-nirdhesha* (indication of existence) etc.

## Chapter Five  **Two types of sound:**  *praayogika* (experimental) and
*vainasika* (natural). *Vaisasika* sound originates from things like bellows,
etc. *Praayogika* sound is of four types, based on the differences between
*tata*, *vitata*, *ghana*, and *soushira*.  * **Tata** sound originates from
things like *pushkara*, *bheri*, and *dardura* made from leather. * **Vitata**
sound originates from things like stringed *veena* and *sughoṣa*. * **Ghana**
sound originates from striking things like *tal*, *ghanta*, and *lalana*. *
**Soushira** sound originates from blowing things like *vamsa*, *shankha*, etc.
**Two types of *bandha* (bond):** *vaisasika* and *praayogika*. *Vaisasika*
*bandha* does not require human intervention. For example, the *bandha* that is
the subject of lightning, meteor, cloud, fire, and rainbow, which arises from
the qualities of *snigdha* (unctuous) and *ruksha* (dry), is *vaisasika*.
*Praayogika* *bandha* arises from human intervention. It is of two types:
*ajiva* (non-living) related and *jiva-ajiva* (living-non-living) related.
*Praayogika* *bandha* related to *ajiva* is exemplified by things like *jatuka*
(lac) and *astha* (wood). *Praayogika* *bandha* related to *jiva-ajiva* is the
*bandha* of *karma* (action) and *no-karma* with living beings.  **Two types of
*saukshyam* (subtlety):** *antya* (ultimate) and *apekshika* (relative). *Antya*
subtlety is found in *paramanu* (atoms). *Apekshika* subtlety is found in things
like *vilva* (wood apple), *amalaka* (gooseberry), and *badara* (jujube).  **Two
types of *sthaulya* (grossness):** *antya* and *apekshika*. *Antya* grossness is
found in the *maha-skandha* (great body) that pervades the universe. *Apekshika*
grossness is found in things like *badara*, *amalaka*, *vilva*, and *tala* (palm
tree).  ***Sansthana* (form) is the same as *aakriti* (shape).** It is of two
types: *ittham-lakshana* (described) and *anittham-lakshana* (undescribed).
*Ittham-lakshana* *sansthana* is that which can be described as "this form is
like this". Examples include *vrutta* (circle), *trikona* (triangle), *chatur-
asra* (quadrilateral), *ayata* (rectangle), and *parimandala* (circumference).
*Anittham-lakshana* *sansthana* is that which cannot be described as "this form
is like this". Examples include the various forms of clouds, etc.  **Six types
of *bheda* (difference):** *utkara*, *churna*, *khanda*, *churnika*, *pratar*,
and *anu-chatan*.  * **Utkara** is the difference created by cutting things like
wood with things like hands and blades. * **Churna** is the difference created
by grinding things like barley and wheat into things like *saktu* (flour) and
*kanika* (grains). * **Khanda** is the difference created by breaking things
like pots into things like *kapala* (skull) and *shankara* (sugar). *
**Churnika** is the difference created by breaking things like *masa* (lentil)
and *mudga* (mung bean). * **Pratara** is the difference created by the
different layers of clouds, etc. * **Anu-chatan** is the difference created by
the sparks that fly out when things like heated iron balls are struck with
things like hammers.  ***Tamo* (darkness) is the obstruction of vision.**

[226] Sarvarthasiddhi [51256 573] The cause of darkness is the obstruction of
light. Shadow is caused by the covering of light. It is of two kinds - one that
is transformed into a change of color, etc., and the other that is merely a
reflection. The heat and light caused by the sun, etc., is called *ātapa*. The
light that originates from the moon, fireflies, etc., is called *udyota*. These
words, etc., are the transformations of the pudgala substance. Therefore, the
pudgalas are called *śabda*, *bandha*, *saukṣmya*, *sthaulya*, *saṃsthāna*,
*bheda*, *tama*, *chāyā*, *ātapa*, and *udyota*. The word 'ca' in the sūtra
indicates that the transformations of the pudgala, such as *nodana*,
*abhighāta*, etc., which are well-known in the āgama, should be included. 6 573.
To show the difference between these pudgalas, the next sūtra says: *Aṇavaḥ
skandhāś ca* ||25|| 8574. Those that are called 'anyante', i.e., spoken of,
because of their ability to produce the transformations of touch, etc., in a
single space, are called *aṇavaḥ*. This means that the *aṇu* is the smallest
because it exists in a single space. It is so subtle that it is the beginning,
the middle, and the end. It is said: "That which is the beginning, the middle,
and the end, and which cannot be perceived by the senses, is the indivisible
substance called the *paramāṇu*." Those in which there is the aggregation of the
actions of grasping, placing, etc., in a gross form, are called *skandha*. In
common usage, an action that occurs in one place is taken as a symbol for all
places, therefore, the term *skandha* is also used for the *dvaṇuka*, etc.,
which are not capable of grasping, etc. Although there are infinite varieties of
pudgalas, they are all of two kinds - *aṇu* and *skandha*. 1. Ni. Sa., Ga. 261

-5126 $ 576] Chapter Five [227 The plural is used to indicate the infinite
varieties of these two categories. The terms 'anu' and 'skandha' are used to
denote these varieties, as explained earlier. Anus are those that have touch,
taste, smell, and color. Skandhas, on the other hand, are those that have sound,
bond, subtlety, grossness, form, difference, shadow, heat, and radiance, as well
as touch, etc. 8575. It is asked, whether the transformation of these pudgalas
into the forms of anu and skandha is beginningless or has a beginning? It is
asserted that it has a beginning because it is produced. If so, then tell us
from what cause it is produced? In order to explain the cause of the production
of skandhas, the following sutra is stated: They are produced from the
combination of differences. ||26|| 8576. The division of combinations due to the
cause of duality is called difference. The coming together of separate entities
is called combination. But there are two things, difference and combination, so
the sutra should be in the dual number. The plural is used to indicate the
inclusion of three. This means that skandhas are produced from difference,
combination, and both difference and combination. For example, from the
combination of two atoms, a two-region skandha is produced. From the combination
of a two-region skandha and an atom, or from the combination of three atoms, a
three-region skandha is produced. From the combination of two two-region
skandhas, a three-region skandha and an atom, or from the combination of four
atoms, a four-region skandha is produced. In this way, from the combination of
countable, uncountable, infinite, and infinitely infinite atoms, skandhas with
that many regions are produced. And from the difference of these same countable,
etc., atoms, skandhas up to the two-region skandha are produced. In the same
way, from the difference and combination that occur at the same time, 1. Third -

2281 Sarvarthasiddhi [5127 8 577 From the two factors of *bheda* (difference)
and *samghata* (combination), *skandhas* (aggregates) with two regions and so on
arise. Otherwise, it is by the difference of one from another and their
combination. Thus, the cause of the origin of *skandhas* is stated. $ 577. To
show the cause of the origin of *anu* (atom), it is said: From *bheda*
(difference), *anu* (atom) arises. ||27|| 8 578. "A rule is for the sake of
establishing a truth that is already established." The origin of *anu* is from
*bheda* (difference) alone, not from *samghata* (combination) nor from both
*bheda* and *samghata*. 6579. It is said, when the origin of *skandhas* from
*samghata* (combination) is already established, the inclusion of *bheda* and
*samghata* is meaningless. To explain the purpose of including these two
factors, it is said: From *bheda* and *samghata*, *chakshusha* (visible) arises.
||28|| 8580. Even though produced from an infinite collection of infinite
*paramanus* (atoms), some *skandhas* are *chakshusha* (visible) and some are
*achakshusha* (invisible). Of these, how does the *achakshusha* become
*chakshusha*? It is said: From *bheda* and *samghata*, *chakshusha* arises. Not
from *bheda* alone. What is the reason for this? It is said: Due to the *bheda*
(difference) of a *skandha* with subtle transformation, it does not lose its
subtlety, and therefore remains *achakshusha* (invisible). Another *skandha*
with subtle transformation, even though it undergoes *bheda* (difference),
combines with another *samghata* (combination), and therefore loses its
subtlety, giving rise to grossness, and becomes *chakshusha* (visible). And
*samghata* from these two, *skandhas* with two regions and so on arise. The
meaning is that when there is *bheda* (difference) from another *skandha* and
*samghata* (combination) of another, then together *bheda* and *samghata* from
these two also, the origin of *skandha* takes place. Thus, the cause of the
origin of *skandhas* is stated. 8 577. Now, to show the cause of the origin of
*anu* (atom), the next sutra says: From *bheda* (difference), *anu* (atom)
arises. ||27|| 8 578. Any rule, even if it is already established, is for the
sake of establishing that rule. The meaning is that *anu* (atom) arises from
*bheda* (difference), even though this is already established, yet by
constructing this sutra ' *anu* ', this rule is established that the origin of
*anu* is only from *bheda* (difference). It does not arise from *samghata*
(combination) nor from both *bheda* and *samghata*. 579. When the origin of
*skandhas* from *samghata* (combination) is already established, then the
inclusion of both *bheda* and *samghata* in the sutra is meaningless. Therefore,
to explain the purpose of including these two factors, the next sutra says: From
*bheda* and *samghata*, *chakshusha* (visible) *skandha* arises. ||28|| 8580.
Even though produced from an infinite collection of infinite *paramanus*
(atoms), some *skandhas* are *chakshusha* (visible) and some are *achakshusha*
(invisible). Of these, how does the *achakshusha* become *chakshusha*? It is
said: From *bheda* and *samghata*, *chakshusha* arises, not from *bheda* alone.
This is the meaning of this sutra. Doubt: What is the reason for this? Solution:
The same reason is explained further: Due to the *bheda* (difference) of a
*skandha* with subtle transformation, it does not lose its subtlety, and
therefore remains *achakshusha* (invisible). Another *skandha* with subtle
transformation, even though it undergoes *bheda* (difference), combines with
another *samghata* (combination), and therefore loses its subtlety, giving rise
to grossness, and becomes *chakshusha* (visible). 1. ' *Siddh satyarambho

## Chapter Five  **581.** It has been stated that the specific characteristics
of substances like dharma, etc. have been mentioned, but the general
characteristic has not been stated. That should be stated. It is stated:  **The
characteristic of substance is sat.** ||29||  **8582.** The meaning of this
sutra is that whatever is sat is substance.  **8583.** If this is so, then it
should be stated what is sat. Therefore, the next sutra states:  **That which is
endowed with utpada, vyaya, and dhrauvya is sat.** ||30||  **8584.** There are
two types of substances: cetana (conscious) and acetana (non-conscious). They
never abandon their own jati (category), yet due to the influence of both
internal and external causes, they acquire a new state at every moment. This
acquisition of a new state is called utpada. For example, the transformation of
a lump of clay into a pot. Similarly, the abandonment of the previous state is
called vyaya. For example, the abandonment of the shape of a lump of clay when a
pot is created. Since it has an eternal and continuous nature, it does not
undergo vyaya or udhaya (emergence), but remains stable. Therefore, it is called
dhruva. The state or karma of this dhruva is called dhrauvya. For example, the
presence of clay in the states of a lump of clay, a pot, etc. Thus, that which
is endowed with utpada, vyaya, and dhrauvya is sat.  **Objection:** The word
"yukta" (endowed with) is seen in the context of difference. For example,
"Devadatta is endowed with a stick." Here, there is a difference between
Devadatta and the stick. If we assume the same in the present case, then the
absence of those three and the substance endowed with those three would result.
**Solution:** This is not a fault, because even in the absence of difference,
the word "yukta" is seen in the context of a certain perspective of difference.
For example, "The pillar is endowed with essence." In such a situation, since
there is an inseparable relationship between those three, the use of the word
"yukta" is appropriate.  **Alternatively:** The word "yukta" is used in the
sense of samadhi (concentration). The meaning is that "yukta," "samahita"
(concentrated), and "tadātmaka" (identical with that) are all synonyms.
Therefore, the statement "sat is endowed with utpada, vyaya, and dhrauvya" means
"sat is identical with utpada, vyaya, and dhrauvya."  **Note:** 1. "jahat" - आ.,

ityuchyate. Kastabhavah? Pratyabhijnanahetuta. Tadevedamiti smaranam The meaning
is that production, etc., are the characteristics of substance, and substance is
the object. If we consider these from the perspective of the paryayaathika nay,
they are distinct from each other and from substance. If we consider them from
the perspective of the dravyathika nay, they are not found separately, and
therefore they are not different. Thus, the relationship of object and
characteristic is established. Special meaning - Here, the characteristics of
substance are described as production, destruction, and the nature of
permanence. Production is the acquisition of a new paryaya without abandoning
one's own jati due to both causes. Destruction is the abandonment of the
previous paryaya. And permanence is the continuous existence of the anādi
parinaamik nature. For example, when coal burns and becomes ash, the coal-like
paryaya of pudgala is destroyed, and the ash-like paryaya is produced. But in
both states, the pudgala substance remains. The pudgalatva never perishes, this
is its permanence. The idea is that every substance is changing, and this change
is happening all the time. For example, milk turns into curd after some time,
and then buttermilk is made from the curd. Here, although there are three
different states, milk, curd, and buttermilk, they are all of the same gorasa.
Similarly, in every substance, even though there are differences in states, its
anvay is found, therefore it is established as being endowed with production,
destruction, and permanence. This is the common nature of every substance. Now
the question arises, how can every substance be three-fold at the same time?
Perhaps it can be considered as production and destruction due to the difference
in time, because what is produced must be destroyed in due course. However, it
cannot be considered as permanent in that state, because there is a
contradiction in considering what is produced and destroyed as permanent. The
solution is that these three qualities are considered in substance due to the
difference in states. At the time when the previous state of the substance is
destroyed, its new state is produced, yet its trikalik anvay nature remains.
Acharya Samantabhadra has expressed this in these words - 'The one who desires a
pot is sad when it is destroyed, the one who desires a crown is happy when it is
produced, and the one who desires gold is neither sad nor happy, he remains
neutral.' This sorrow, joy, and neutrality cannot happen without a reason at the
same time, from this it is proved that every substance is endowed with
production, destruction, and permanence. 8585. The sutra
'nityavasthanianyrupaani' has been said. There it is not known what is nitya,
therefore the next sutra says Not being detached from its bhavah (its jati) is
nitya ||3|| 8586. Now we explain the word tadbhavah. Doubt - What is
'tadbhavah'? 1. -The three grandmothers are substance. 2. The object. That
paryaya - grandmother, mother, daughter. 1.

Chapter Five  **Recognition**  The cause of recognition is *tad-bhāva* (the
state of being the same). It is not accidental. The word *bhāva* means "being."
The being of that is *tad-bhāva*. The object that was seen before is recognized
as the same by the same self, because of its being. If there were complete
annihilation or only a new emergence, then there would be no possibility of
remembrance. The worldly conduct that depends on remembrance would be
contradicted. Therefore, it is certain that what is not subject to annihilation
is *tad-bhāva-avyaya* (imperishable in its being), that is, eternal. However,
this must be understood in a certain way. If eternality is accepted in an
absolute sense, then there would be a contradiction with the process of the
cause of the world and its cessation, because of the absence of the absence of
otherness.  **Objection:** Is it not contradictory to say that the same thing is
both eternal and non-eternal? If it is eternal, then there is no annihilation or
emergence, and thus no contradiction with non-eternality. And if it is non-
eternal, then there is no permanence, and thus no contradiction with eternality.
**Solution:** This is not contradictory, because of the principle of *arpita-
anarpita-siddhi* (the establishment of the primary and secondary).
**Explanation:** An object is multi-faceted. Depending on the purpose, one of
its qualities is made primary and is called *arpita* (primary) or *upaniita*
(secondary). Conversely, when there is no purpose, even though a quality exists,
it is not considered primary and is called *anarpita* (secondary). *Arpita* and
*anarpita* are both *arpita-anarpita*. Because of this principle, there is no
contradiction. For example, Devadatta has a father, a son, a brother, a nephew,
and so on.

[232] **Sarvarthasiddhi** [5133 § 589 Relationships arising from causes like
fatherhood and sonship do not contradict each other; due to the non-difference
of the object of application. For example, with respect to the son, he is the
father, and with respect to the father, he is the son, and so on. Similarly,
there is no contradiction in the fact that a substance is eternal with respect
to the general and non-eternal with respect to the particular. These general and
particular are, in some way, the cause of the transaction due to their
difference and non-difference. 8589. Here it is said, due to the fact that the
real is subject to the transaction of many kinds of Nayas, the origin of the
Skandhas from the aggregates of differences is justified. But this is doubtful,
whether the aggregate is only due to combination, characterized by dyads, etc.,
or whether there is some other specific characteristic? It is said, "When there
is combination, the aggregate arises from the bondage that is characterized by
the result of oneness. Even if this is said, why then, in the case of the
abandonment of the Pudgala-jati, is there bondage for some and not for others
when there is combination? It is said, because even though they are all Pudgalas
in terms of their jati, their infinite Paryayas undergo mutually distinct
transformations, and therefore, the power that arises from this makes it appear
that - Bondage arises from the qualities of being oily and rough. || 330 $ 590.
Due to external and internal causes, the oily Paryaya appears, and therefore, it
is called oily. Similarly, due to roughness, it is called rough. The oily and
the rough are oily-rough. Their state is the quality of being oily-rough. The
quality of being oily is the Paryaya characterized by the quality of being
slippery. The opposite transformation of this is the quality of being rough. The
reason is indicated in the sutra, "From the quality of being oily-rough." This
is the cause of The type is   like Devadatta's father, son, brother, and nephew.
Similarly, there are other relationships arising from causes like fatherhood and
sonship, which do not lead to contradiction. When a particular dharma is
predominant, it is considered in that context. For example, with respect to the
son, he is the father, and with respect to the father, he is the son, and so on.
Similarly, a substance is eternal with respect to the general and non-eternal
with respect to the particular, so there is no contradiction. These general and
particular are, in some way, the cause of the transaction due to their
difference and non-difference. 8589. Doubt - Since the real is subject to the
transaction of many kinds of Nayas, the origin of the Skandhas from the
aggregates of differences, and the aggregates of differences themselves, may be
justified, but it is doubtful whether the aggregate characterized by dyads,
etc., is only due to combination, or whether there is some other specific
characteristic? Solution - When there is combination, the aggregate arises from
the bondage that is characterized by the result of oneness. Doubt - If this is
the case, then explain why, even though all Pudgalas are of the same jati, there
is bondage for some and not for others when there is combination? Solution -
Because even though they are all Pudgalas in terms of their jati, their infinite
Paryayas undergo mutually distinct transformations, and therefore, the power
that arises from this makes it appear that - Bondage arises from the qualities
of being oily and rough. || 33 || 8 590. Due to external and internal causes,
the oily Paryaya appears, and therefore, it is called oily. Its etymology is
"snihyate smeti snigdha". Similarly, due to roughness, it is called rough. The
oily Pudgala's dharma is oiliness, and the rough Pudgala's dharma is roughness.
The Paryaya of the Pudgala that is characterized by the quality of being
slippery is oiliness, and the opposite transformation of this is roughness. The
sutra indicates the reason as "snigdharukshatvat". The meaning is that 1.

-5135 § 593] Chapter Five [233 Bond is the result of the combination of two
atoms. When two atoms with the qualities of *snigdha* (smooth) and *ruksha*
(rough) come together, they form a *dwayanuka* (two-atom) *skandha* (aggregate).
In the same way, *skandhas* with *sanchya* (countable), *asanchya*
(uncountable), and *ananta* (infinite) regions are formed. The *snigdha* quality
has one, two, three, four, *sanchya*, *asanchya*, and *ananta* variations.
Similarly, the *ruksha* quality also has one, two, three, four, *sanchya*,
*asanchya*, and *ananta* variations. These qualities are present in atoms. Just
as the *snigdha* quality is present in water, goat, cow, buffalo, and camel milk
and ghee in increasing degrees, and the *ruksha* quality is present in dust,
particles, and sugar in decreasing degrees, similarly, the *snigdha* and
*ruksha* qualities are also present in atoms in varying degrees. § 591. When the
bond is formed due to the *snigdha* and *ruksha* qualities, and there is no
distinction in the bond, then the following sutra explains the reason for the
non-existence of undesirable qualities: There is no bond of *jghanya* (inferior)
qualities. ||34|| § 592. Here, *jghanya* means inferior, and *guna* means part.
Those who have *jghanya* qualities, i.e., whose power is inferior, are called
*jghanya* qualities. There is no bond of those *jghanya* qualities. For example,
there is no bond between one *snigdha* power-part and another *snigdha* power-
part, or between one *snigdha* power-part and two or more, *sanchya*,
*asanchya*, and *ananta* power-parts. Similarly, there is no bond between one
*snigdha* power-part and one *ruksha* power-part, or between one *snigdha*
power-part and two or more, *sanchya*, *asanchya*, and *ananta* *ruksha* power-
parts. Similarly, the same applies to one *ruksha* power-part. § 593.  Except
for these *jghanya* *snigdha* and *ruksha* power-parts, the bond of other
*snigdha* and *ruksha* atoms is generally obtained. Therefore, to explain that
those who are not bondable are the subject of prohibition, the following sutra
is stated: There is no bond of those of the same kind when the qualities are
equal. ||35||

Three sticky substances with double the attributes and two non-sticky substances
with double the attributes - Two sticky substances with double the attributes
and two sticky substances with double the attributes - Two non-sticky substances
with double the attributes and two non-sticky substances with double the
attributes and so on.  8595. If this is the case, then what is the purpose of
using the term 'sādṛśya' (similarity)? The term 'sādṛśya' is used to denote that
even in the case of dissimilar attributes, there can be bondage between similar
classes and dissimilar classes.  8596. Therefore, it is stated that there is
bondage between substances with two or more additional attributes, but not for
others. What are these substances with two or more additional attributes? They
are the ones with four attributes. The term 'ādi' (etc.) indicates that this
principle applies to substances with more than four attributes as well. The
additional attribute here refers to the 'two or more' part. Due to this, there
is no conception of substances with five, six, seven, eight, countable infinite,
or innumerable attributes. Thus, the bondage is stated for substances with two
or more additional attributes, whether of similar or dissimilar classes, but not
for others. For example, a two-attribute sticky substance does not have bondage
with a one-attribute sticky, two-attribute sticky, or three-attribute sticky
substance. However, it does have bondage with a four-attribute sticky substance.
Further, that same two-attribute sticky substance does not have bondage with a
five-attribute, six-attribute, seven-attribute, countable infinite-attribute, or
innumerable-attribute sticky substance. Similarly, a three-attribute sticky
substance has bondage with a five-attribute sticky substance, but not with the
rest.

There is no bond between a single-atom and other atoms with one, two, or three
units of *snigdha* (smooth) or *ruksha* (rough) power. However, there is a bond
with an atom having four units of *ruksha* power. Similarly, there is no bond
between an atom with two units of *ruksha* power and atoms with five or more
units of *ruksha* power. Likewise, the bond between atoms with three or more
units of *ruksha* power and atoms with two or more units of *ruksha* power
should be understood. This principle applies to atoms of different types as
well. As it is said:  "A bond occurs between two atoms with the same type of
power, when one has two more units of power than the other. This applies to both
*snigdha* and *ruksha* atoms. A bond also occurs between a *snigdha* and a
*ruksha* atom, following the same principle. However, a bond with an atom having
a lower power is completely prohibited."  The word "tu" in the sutra is an
adjective, which negates the prohibition of the bond and establishes the bond.
8597. Why is it said that a bond occurs with an atom having more power, but not
with an atom having the same power? To answer this, the next sutra says:  "A
bond with an atom having two more units of power is transformative."  8598. The
word "guna" (power) is used in this sutra, referring to the "more power"
mentioned earlier. The transformative nature of a bond is like that of wet
jaggery. Just as wet jaggery, with its higher sweetness, transforms the dust
particles on it by absorbing their properties, similarly, an atom with more
power transforms an atom with less power. According to this principle, an atom
with two units of *snigdha* or *ruksha* power is transformed by an atom with
four units of *snigdha* or *ruksha* power. This leads to the abandonment of the
previous states and the emergence of a new, distinct state, resulting in unity.
Otherwise, like white and black threads, even if they are in contact, they would
not be transformative and would remain separate.

## 236] Sarvarthasiddhi  [5137 $ 598] If all were to remain in a separate form
due to [the principle of] kत्वात्, then, according to the stated law, upon
binding, the karma of jñāna-āvaraṇa etc. would become established as a state
like the tri-sāgara, koṭi-koṭi-cādi etc. It would remain so. But, upon binding
by the stated law, the karma of jñāna-āvaraṇa etc. becomes established as a
state like the tri-sāgara, koṭi-koṭi-cādi etc.  **Special Meaning:** Here, the
question of how one atom etc. binds with another atom etc. has been considered.
Rough and smooth are opposing qualities. That which has the smooth quality does
not have the rough quality, and that which has the rough quality does not have
the smooth quality. These qualities are the cause of binding. But, this does not
mean that the mere harmony of rough and smooth qualities is the cause of
binding, because if that were the case, then not a single pudgala atom could
remain unbound. Therefore, it has been explained here through the law of vidhi-
niṣedha which pudgala atoms etc. bind with each other and which do not. Those
pudgala-āṇus which have the smooth and rough qualities with a low potency do not
bind. Similarly, when there is equality of qualities, then the similar ones do
not bind, but only those pudgala atoms etc. which have two or more qualities
bind with those pudgala atoms etc. which have two or fewer qualities. This is
the rule: binding occurs between those with the smooth quality and those with
the smooth quality, between those with the rough quality and those with the
rough quality, and between those with the smooth quality and those with the
rough quality. According to this, the following arrangement results:  | **Serial
No.** | **Quality Share** | **Similar Binding** | **Dissimilar Binding** |
|---|---|---|---| | 1 | Low + Low | No | No | | 2 | Low + One or more than one
higher than low | No | Higher than low + Equal to higher than low | | 3 | Higher
than low + One more than higher than low | No | Higher than low + Two or more
than two higher than low | | 4 | Higher than low + Two or more than two higher
than low | No | Higher than low + Three or more than three higher than low | | 5
| Higher than low + Three or more than three higher than low | No | No | | 6 |
Higher than low + Four or more than four higher than low | No | No |  This
binding arrangement, as stated in the Tattvārtha-sūtra, follows the Pravacana-
sāra. The Pravacana-sāra also instructs on the binding arrangement in the same
way, but the binding arrangement mentioned in the Vargaṇā-khaṇḍa of the
Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama is slightly different. To understand this properly, a bracket is
given below:  | **Serial No.** | **Quality Share** | **Similar Binding** |
**Dissimilar Binding** | |---|---|---|---| | 1 | Low + Low | No | No | | 2 | Low
+ One or more than one higher than low | No | Higher than low + Equal to higher
than low | | 3 | Higher than low + One more than higher than low | No | Higher
than low + Two or more than two higher than low | | 4 | Higher than low + Two or
more than two higher than low | No | Higher than low + Three or more than three
higher than low | | 5 | Higher than low + Three or more than three higher than
low | No | No | | 6 | Higher than low + Four or more than four higher than low |
No | No |  [Low ares]

[237 -51388 600] Chapter Five $ 599. The definition of dravya as "that which is
endowed with production, destruction, and permanence" has been stated. Now, to
explain the definition of dravya in another way, the following sutra is stated:
Dravya is that which has guna and paryaya. ||38|| 8600. Guna and paryaya are
called guna-paryaya. Dravya is that which has these. Here, the use of the suffix
'matup' has been explained earlier. The meaning is that dravya is somehow
different from its guna and paryaya, hence the use of the suffix 'matup'.
Question: What are guna and paryaya? Answer: Guna are those that are inherent
(anvayi), and paryaya are those that are non-inherent (vyatireki). Dravya is
that which is endowed with both. It has been said: "The characteristic that
differentiates a dravya from other dravyas is called guna, and the modification
of a dravya is called paryaya. Dravya is endowed with both of these. It is also
eternal and self-evident." The meaning is that that by which one dravya is
distinguished from another is guna. It is by this guna that the existence of
that dravya is established. If there were no differentiating guna, there would
be a mixture of dravyas. For example, the jiva dravya is distinguished from
pudgala etc. by guna such as knowledge etc., and pudgala etc. are distinguished
by guna such as form etc. If there were no distinction due to guna such as
knowledge etc., there would be a mixture. Therefore, in relation to the general,
knowledge etc. are the guna of the jiva, and form etc. are the guna of pudgala
etc. Their modifications, which are different in a specific way, are called
paryaya. For example, knowledge of a pot, knowledge of a cloth, anger, pride,
smell, color, intense, and mild etc. That which is somehow different from these
and is a collection is called dravya. If the collection were to be considered
completely non-different, then there would be the consequence of the non-
existence of everything. For example, if there is a collection of things that
are mutually different, then due to the non-existence of one after another,
there would be the non-existence of the collection.  8599. The definition of

[238] Sarvarthasiddhi [$139 § 601. Because of being different from each other.
If this form is considered to be different from the rasa etc., then the
aggregate is also different from them. And the aggregate which is different from
the rasa etc. and is not different from the form, how can it not be different
from the rasa etc.? Therefore, only form is the aggregate. And one form cannot
be an aggregate. Therefore, there is no aggregate. And due to the absence of the
aggregate, there is also the absence of the aggregate of those who are different
from it. Thus, there is the absence of everything. In the same way, it should be
said with respect to rasa etc. Therefore, if one wants to accept the aggregate,
then one must accept it as being different in some way. § 601. After describing
the characteristics of the mentioned substances, it is established that the
substance is the subject of that characteristic. Therefore, to indicate the
substance that has not been mentioned, the next sutra says Time is also a
substance. ||39|| 1 It is. The explanation is as follows: If an aggregate of
mutually different qualities is considered to be one and indivisible, then the
absence of the aggregate and everything else is obtained, because those
qualities are mutually different. The form is different from the rasa etc. Now,
if their aggregate is considered to be indivisible, then the form which is
different from the rasa etc. and the aggregate which is indivisible from it, how
can it not be different from the rasa etc.? i.e. it will be. And thus, the
aggregate is obtained as only form. But one form quality cannot be an aggregate,
therefore, the absence of the aggregate is obtained. And due to the absence of
the aggregate, there is also the absence of the aggregates which are different
from it. Thus, there is the absence of the aggregate and everything else. In the
same way, it should be said with respect to rasa etc. Therefore, if the
aggregate is accepted, then it must be accepted as being different in some way.
Special Meaning - It has been said before that there is a substance with
production, destruction, and permanence. Here, the characteristic of the
substance is stated in a different way. In this, the substance is described as
having qualities and their permutations. The point is that every substance is
merely a mass of infinite qualities and their permutations that occur in
sequence. Qualities are said to be pervasive everywhere and permutations are
said to be exclusive. This means that those which maintain uniformity in the
stream are called qualities and those which make it appear different are called
permutations. In the jiva, there is never a break in the stream of knowledge
etc., in the pudgala, there is never a break in the stream of form, rasa etc.,
in the dharma dravya, there is never a break in the stream of the cause of
motion, in the adharma dravya, there is never a break in the stream of the cause
of rest, in the akasha, there is never a break in the stream of the cause of
penetration, and in the kala dravya, there is never a break in the stream of
existence, therefore, they are the qualities of that particular substance. But
those qualities do not remain the same forever. If the qualities of the eternal
substances are left out, even then, a clear change is observed in the qualities
of the jiva and the pudgalas at every moment. For example, the knowledge quality
of the jiva is sometimes in the form of mati jnana and sometimes in the form of
shruti jnana in the state of samsara. Therefore, these mati jnana etc. are the
permutations of the knowledge quality. In the same way, it should be understood
in other qualities as well. The substance always remains in these quality-like
permutations, therefore, it is said to be having qualities and permutations.
Nevertheless, qualities and permutations should not be considered completely
different from the substance. Both of them together are the soul of the
substance. This means that there is no independent substance apart from
qualities and permutations. § 601. By indicating the characteristic of the
previously mentioned substances, it is obtained that the substance is the
subject of that characteristic. Therefore, to indicate the substance that has
not been mentioned yet, the next sutra says Time is also a substance. ||39||

-5139 6 602] Chapter Five [239 8602. Question: What is the remaining part of the
sentence "dravya"? Answer: It is "dravya". Question: Why is it "dravya"? Answer:
Because it possesses the characteristics of a dravya. Two characteristics of
dravya have been mentioned: "That which is endowed with production, destruction,
and dhrauvya is sat" and "That which has guna and paryaya is dravya". Both these
characteristics are present in time. For example, dhrauvya is self-caused in
time, because it establishes the order of its own nature. Destruction and
production are other-caused, and they are also self-caused in relation to the
increase and decrease of the guna of heavy and light. Similarly, there are two
types of guna in time: ordinary and extraordinary. The extraordinary guna is the
cause of activity, and the ordinary guna is the nature of being inanimate,
formless, subtle, heavy, and light. Paryaya can also be attributed to the
characteristics of destruction and production. Therefore, since time possesses
both types of characteristics, it is established that time is a dravya like
space, etc. The reason for its existence has been explained like that of dharma,
etc., as "The characteristic of time is activity". Question: Why is time
mentioned separately? It should have been mentioned along with dharma, etc., in
the first sutra, which would then be "Ajivikaaya
dharmadharmaaakaashakaalapudgalaah". Answer: This is not a valid question,
because if it were mentioned there, it would be considered a kaya. But time is
not considered a kaya, because it lacks the concept of both primary and
secondary pradeshaprachaya. The primary pradeshaprachaya of dharma, etc., has
been mentioned in sutras like "Asankhyeyaah pradeshaah". Similarly, the
secondary pradeshaprachaya of an atom, which has only one pradesha, has been
mentioned in relation to the nay of knowing the past and future. But time does
not have the concept of both types of pradeshaprachaya, therefore it is not a
kaya. Furthermore, if time is included in the first sutra, then in the sutra
"Nishkriyaani cha", where dharma, etc., up to space are said to be inactive,
time would also become active, just like jiva and pudgala become active.
Question: To avoid this flaw, should time be placed before space? Answer: This
is not correct, because the sutra "Aa aakaashaadekadravyaani" states that 1.
iti. Kimartha- Mu. 2. -taraprasha- Mu. 3. -pudgalaadiinaam Mu. 4. -shyete. Aa

## 2401 Sarvarthasiddhi  [5139 8602] It would be so. Therefore, a separate
explanation of time is being made. If there are many substances, what is the
proof of this? There are as many Kalaanu as there are regions of the Lokakasha,
and they are inactive. In each region of the Lokakasha, one Kalaanu is spread
throughout the Lokakasha and arranged. It is said:  "In each region of the
Lokakasha, there are as many Kalaanu as there are grains of sand. They should be
considered like the heaps of grains."  They are formless due to the absence of
qualities like form.  **Explanation:** If Kala is placed before Akasha, it
acquires the status of a single substance. All these defects should not remain,
therefore, a separate explanation of Kala is given.  **Doubt:** Kala is many
substances, what is the proof of this?  **Solution:** There are as many Kalaanu
as there are regions of the Lokakasha, and they are inactive. This means that
one Kalaanu is present in each region of the Lokakasha. It is also said: "In
each region of the Lokakasha, those that are present like heaps of grains of
sand, know them as Kalaanu." These Kalaanu are formless because they are devoid
of qualities like form.  **Special Note:** Earlier, the existence of the first
five substances was discussed. Here, the sixth substance, Kala, is being
considered. There are two opinions in the Shvetambar tradition regarding whether
Kala is a substance or not. One opinion accepts Kala as a substance, while the
other does not consider Kala as an independent substance. According to this
second opinion, the form of time that is experienced as day-night, hour-minute,
moment-instant, etc., due to the Sun, etc., is a modification of the Pudgala
substance. But the question to be considered is: What is the cause of the
transformation of these living beings, Pudgala, etc., substances? If it is said
that being born, being destroyed, and remaining constant are the nature of every
substance, then what is the need to believe in another cause? To this question,
the argument is that if the transformation of every substance is considered to
be entirely due to its nature, then what is the objection to considering motion,
rest, and perception as entirely due to its nature? And in such a situation,
only two substances, Jiva and Pudgala, would remain, and the absence of other
substances would be obtained. Why only this? Even the bondage of Jiva and
Pudgala, and Pudgala and Pudgala, would have to be considered entirely natural.
There would be no need to believe in the cause-effect relationship, and in such
a state, even a liberated Jiva would naturally become bound, and a worldly Jiva
would become liberated without any effort. If it is said that motion, rest,
etc., are actions, and all actions occur only when these two, cause and
material, come together, therefore, the existence of Dharma, Adharma, and Akasha
substances is accepted as the cause of actions like motion, rest, and
perception, then what is the harm in accepting the existence of Kala substance
as the cause of the transformation of every substance? That is, nothing.
Considering this, the existence of Kala substance is proved.  Still, this Kala
substance is neither countless-regioned nor infinite-regioned like Jiva and
other substances, but there are as many Kala substances as there are regions of
the Lokakasha, and each Kala substance is present in each region of the
Lokakasha. The explanation is as follows:  There are two types of expansion:
horizontal expansion and vertical expansion. The expansion of regions is called
horizontal expansion, and the expansion of non-causal modifications is called
vertical expansion. Akasha is infinite-regioned because it is present
everywhere, Dharma and Adharma are countless-regioned because they are present
in countless regions, and Jiva is countless-regioned because it is present in
countless regions.

## Chapter Five  **8603.** The proof of the main time, which is characterized by
its duration, has been stated. But what is the proof of the practical time,
which is known through the process of change, etc.? To explain this, the next
sutra says:  **It is infinite time.** (4)  **8604.** Although the present time
is one moment, it is called infinite time because the past and future are
infinite times. Or, this sutra is said to determine the main time. The meaning
is that infinite permutations occur due to the quality of duration, and...

## 242]  **[5141 8605]**  A single Kalaanu is also considered infinite by
convention. However, time is a very subtle part of Kala, and its aggregates like
Avali, etc., should be understood. **[8605]** It has been said that "Dravya is
with Guna and Paryaya." Now, to explain what Guna is, the next Sutra says:
**Those that reside in Dravya continuously and are devoid of Guna are Guna.**
[41]  **[8606]** Those that have Dravya as their abode are called Dravyaashraya,
and those that are devoid of Guna are called Nirguna. Thus, Guna is
characterized by both these qualities. The epithet "Nirguna" in the Sutra is
used to negate Vyanyuka, etc. They too reside in the Dravya of their cause, the
Paramanu, and are endowed with Guna. Therefore, by the epithet "Nirguna," they
are excluded.  **Doubt:**  All Paryayas like Ghatasansthana, etc., reside in
Dravya and are Nirguna. Therefore, according to the above definition of Guna,
they too should be considered Guna.  **Solution:** The epithet "Dravyaashraya"
in the Sutra means "those that always reside in Dravya are Guna." Thus, by the
epithet "always," Paryayas are excluded, i.e., the definition of Guna does not
apply to Paryayas because Paryayas are occasional.  **Special Note:** It has
been said earlier that Dravya is with Guna and Paryaya. Here, the nature of Guna
is being considered. Since Dravya has been described as having Guna and Paryaya,
it is clear that Guna resides in Dravya, i.e., Dravya is the base and Guna is
the dependent. However, this should not be understood as a complete separation
between the base and the dependent, like Dahi and Kund, because even though Guna
resides in Dravya, it is not entirely different from it. Just as oil pervades
all the parts of sesame seeds, similarly, each Guna pervades all the parts of
Dravya equally. However, this characteristic would also apply to Vyanyuka, etc.,
because Vyanyuka, etc., are also...

[243 -5142 $ 608] Chapter Five $ 607. The word "parinaama" has been mentioned
many times. In response to the question of what its meaning is, it is said: That
which is, is parinaama. ||42|| $ 608. Some believe that qualities are different
from substance. Is this your (Jain) view? No, it is said that although qualities
are somewhat different from substance due to the difference in designation,
etc., they are not different from substance due to their non-separation from it
and their being its parinaama. If this is so, then tell us what parinaama is. To
determine this, it is said: The way in which substance, such as dharma, etc.,
exists is called tadbhaava or tattva, and this is called parinaama. It is of two
types: anaadi and saadi. Of these, the motion, attachment, etc., of substance,
such as dharma, etc., are anaadi in relation to the general, and saadi in
relation to the specific. Thus ends the fifth chapter of the Tattvarthavritti,
known as Sarvarth Siddhi. They reside in their fundamental atomic substance.
Therefore, those that are themselves devoid of specific qualities are called
qualities. It is a rule that just as qualities are found in substance, other
qualities are not found in qualities. Therefore, qualities are themselves devoid
of specific qualities. Thus, although those that reside in substance and are
themselves devoid of specific qualities are called qualities, this
characteristic of qualities is also found in synonyms. Because they too reside
in substance and are themselves devoid of specific qualities. Therefore, to
eliminate this fault of overlapping, those that reside in substance should be
understood as those that always reside in substance. Thus, the nature of
qualities has been considered. Another name for qualities is "vishesha". Those
that cause one substance to be different from another substance are called
vishesha, i.e., qualities. This is the meaning of the statement. There are
infinite such qualities in every substance. Some of them are general and some
are specific. Those that are found in multiple substances are called general
qualities, and those that express the specific nature of each substance are
called specific qualities. $607. The word parinaama has been mentioned many
times; but what is its meaning? In response to this question, the next sutra
gives the answer: Its being, i.e., its constant change, is parinaama. ||421 6
608. Or, some believe that qualities are different from substance. Is this
accepted in your (Jain) view? No, it is said that although qualities are
somewhat different from substance due to the difference in designation, etc.,
they are not found to be different from substance, and they are not different
because they are the parinaama of substance. If this is so, then tell us what
parinaama is. To determine this, it is said: The way in which substance, such as
dharma, etc., exists is called tadbhaava or tattva, and this is called
parinaama. It is of two types: anaadi and saadi. Of these, the motion,

8609. The nature of the non-living (ajiva) has been explained. Now, the nature
of the next category, asrava, is to be explained. Therefore, to clarify this,
the following sutra is stated: Body, speech, and mind are the actions (yoga).
||1|| 8610. The words "body" etc. have been explained earlier. "Karma" and
"action" are synonyms. The action of body, speech, and mind is called yoga. This
is the meaning. The movement of the soul's regions is yoga. It is of three
types, based on the difference in the cause: body yoga, speech yoga, and mind
yoga. The explanation is as follows: When the karma of the obstruction of energy
(virya) is destroyed and pacified, the movement of the soul's regions, which is
based on the support of one of the seven types of body categories, such as
generosity, is called body yoga. When the support of the speech categories,
obtained from the arising of the karma called "body," is present, and when the
inner speech attainment is obtained by the destruction and pacification of the
karma of the obstruction of energy and the covering of the non-eternal letters,
etc., the movement of the soul's regions, which is directed towards the speech
category, is called speech yoga. When the inner mind attainment is obtained by
the destruction and pacification of the karma of the obstruction of energy and
the covering of the nine sense organs, and when the support of the mind
categories, which are external causes, is present, the movement of the soul's
regions, which is directed towards the mind category, is called mind yoga. It
should be known that the movement of the soul's regions, which is based on the
three types of categories of the liberated soul (sayogakevali), when the karma
of the obstruction of energy and the karma of the covering of knowledge are
destroyed, is also yoga. 8611. We accept that there are three types of actions
(yoga). Now, tell us: 1. अथाजीवप- म.। आह जीवाजीवप- ता., ना.। इत्यजीवप- दि. 2। 2.

-613 § 615 What is the characteristic of *āsrava*? It is the *yoga* spoken of in
relation to the *samsāri* (transmigrating) being, that is *āsrava*. ||2||
Chapter Six 8612. Just as the door of a reservoir is called *āsrava* because it
is the cause of the water flowing in, so *yoga*, being the channel through which
*karma* flows into the soul, is called *yoga āsrava*. 8613. It is said that
*karma* is of two kinds: *puṇya* (meritorious) and *pāpa* (demeritorious). Is
*yoga* the cause of *āsrava* in general, or is there some specific
characteristic? To explain this, the next *sūtra* says: [245 *śubha yoga* is the
*āsrava* of *puṇya*, and *aśubha yoga* is the *āsrava* of *pāpa*. ||3|| 8614.
Question: What is *śubha yoga* and what is *aśubha yoga*? Answer: Violence,
stealing, and sexual misconduct, etc., are *aśubha kāya yoga* (demeritorious
bodily *yoga*). False speech, harsh speech, and uncultured speech, etc., are
*aśubha vāc yoga* (demeritorious verbal *yoga*). Thoughts of killing, envy, and
jealousy, etc., are *aśubha mano yoga* (demeritorious mental *yoga*). The
opposite of these are *śubha kāya yoga*, *śubha vāc yoga*, and *śubha mano yoga*
(meritorious bodily, verbal, and mental *yoga*). Question: What is the reason
for the distinction between *śubha* and *aśubha yoga*? Answer: *Yoga* that leads
to meritorious results is *śubha yoga*, and *yoga* that leads to demeritorious
results is *aśubha yoga*. It is not that *śubha* and *aśubha yoga* are caused by
*śubha* and *aśubha karma*. If this were the case, then there would be no such
thing as *śubha yoga*, because *śubha yoga* is also considered to be the cause
of the bondage of *karma* such as *jñāna āvaraṇa* (veil of knowledge).
Therefore, the definition of *śubha* and *aśubha yoga* given here is correct.
That which purifies the soul, or by which the soul is purified, is *puṇya*, such
as *sātavedanīya* (that which is experienced in the next life). And that which
protects the soul from *śubha* (meritorious) is *pāpa*, such as *asātavedanīya*
(that which is not experienced in the next life). 8615. Does this *āsrava*
produce the same results for all transmigrating beings, or is there some 1.
*āsravaṇahetu* - *mu.* (mouth), *tā.* (tongue), *nā.* (nose). 2. *pāpam*.
*asadve* - *mu.* 3. *samsārisama ā.* (transmigrating beings), *tā.* (tongue),
*nā.* *samsārasama* etc. 2.

## Chapter Six  [247-615 to 618]  There are five senses, four *kṣayās*, five
*avratas*, and twenty-five *kriyās*.   The five senses, beginning with touch,
have already been mentioned. The four *kṣayās* are anger, etc. The five
*avratas*, beginning with *prāṇa-vyaparopaṇa*, will be discussed later.   Here
we describe the twenty-five *kriyās*:  * **Samyaktvakriyā:** Actions that
increase *samyaktvam*, such as worshipping the *caitya*, the guru, and the
scriptures. * **Mithyātvakriyā:** Actions that lead to *mithyātvam*, such as
praising other deities, etc. * **Prayogakriyā:** Actions involving movement,
such as walking, coming, going, etc., performed by the body, etc. * **Samādāna-
kriyā:** The action of a restrained being facing *aviratī* (non-restraint). *
**Īryāpathakriyā:** Actions that are the cause of *īryāpatha* (wrong conduct).
These are five *kriyās*.  * **Prādoṣikī-kriyā:** Actions arising from anger. *
**Kāyikī-kriyā:** Actions of a corrupted being striving for progress. *
**Ādhikāraṇikī-kriyā:** Actions involving the acquisition of instruments of
violence. * **Pārītāpikī-kriyā:** Actions that cause suffering. *
**Prāṇātipātikī-kriyā:** Actions that cause the separation of life, senses,
strength, and breath.  These are five *kriyās*.  * **Darśanakriyā:** The action
of a deluded being, due to being influenced by *rāga*, etc., intending to see
something beautiful. * **Sparśanakriyā:** The action of touching a conscious
object, due to delusion. * **Prātyayikī-kriyā:** Actions that create new
*adhikāras* (rights). * **Samanupātakriyā:** The action of expelling internal
impurities in the place where women, men, and animals come and go, sit and
stand. * **Anābhōgakriyā:** The action of placing the body, etc., on unswept and
unobserved ground.  These are five *kriyās*.  * **Svahastakriyā:** The action of
doing oneself what others would do. * **Nisarga-kriyā:** The action of giving
consent to specific actions, such as taking *pāpa* (sin), *dāna* (donation),
etc. * **Vidāraṇakriyā:** The action of revealing the wrongdoings of others. *
**Ājñāvyāpādikī-kriyā:** The action of misrepresenting the instructions of the
scriptures, due to the arising of *cāritramoha* (delusion about conduct), when
one is unable to perform the necessary actions as instructed. *
**Anākāṅkṣakriyā:** The action of disrespecting the duties prescribed by the
scriptures, due to cunningness and laziness.  These are five *kriyās*.

## 248] Sarvarthasiddhi [6168 619 The action of being enthusiastic about an
action initiated by another is called Prarabdha Kriya. The action performed for
the sake of destroying attachment is called Parigrahika Kriya. Deception in the
matters of knowledge, perception, etc. is called Maya Kriya. To strengthen
someone with the means of wrong perception, by praising them, saying "You are
doing well", is called Mithyadarshan Kriya. The action of not rejecting the
results of the karmas that destroy restraint, is called Apratyakhyana Kriya.
These are the five Kriyas. These, when combined, become twenty-five Kriyas.
These, along with the senses, etc., become the doors of the Saampraayika Karma
through Asrava, due to the difference and non-difference of cause and effect.
8619. Here it is said, that since the three Yogas are the work of all souls,
they are common to all beings in the world, therefore, there should be
uniformity in the experience of the fruits of bondage. To this, it is said,
"This is not so." Because, even though the Yogas are present in every soul,
there are infinite variations in the results of the souls, therefore, the
experience of the fruits of bondage must be considered as having a special
nature. Question: How? Answer: This is explained in the next Sutra. The special
nature of Asrava is due to the difference in the intensity, mildness, knowledge,
ignorance, object, and power. ||6|| 8620: The result that arises due to the
stimulation of external and internal causes is called Teebhra Bhava. The
opposite of this is called Manda Bhava. To act knowing that "This being should
be killed by me" is called Jnata Bhava. To act without knowing, due to
intoxication or negligence, is called Ajnata Bhava. The object in which things
are placed is called Adhikarana. Here, Adhikarana refers to the substance. The
special power of the substance is called Veerya. The word Bhava should be
combined with all the words, such as Teebhra Bhava, Manda Bhava, etc. Due to all
these reasons, there is a special nature in Asrava, because the difference in
the cause leads to the difference in the effect. 1. Darshanakaran- Ta., Na., Mu.

the purpose of indicating the specific object of the action. It is to be
understood that the living and the non-living are the object of the action. What
is it? It is the state of being an instrument of violence, etc. It may be said
that since the original substances are two, the dual number "jivajiva" is
justified in the sutra. This is not so, because the synonyms are considered to
be the object of the action. The substance with any one synonym is the object of
the action, not the substance alone, therefore the plural number is used in the
sutra. The living and the non-living are the object of the action of what? Of
the inflow. The connection with the inflow is established according to the
meaning. § 623. There, for the purpose of understanding the divisions of the
object of the action of the living, it is said: The first object of the action
of the living is of three kinds due to the divisions of commencement,
preparation, and beginning, of three kinds due to the divisions of yogas, of
three kinds due to the divisions of done, caused, and permitted, and of four
kinds due to the divisions of passions, making a total of one hundred and eight
kinds when combined together. || 8 || § 624. The effort of a careless living
being in the act of killing, etc., is commencement. The gathering of the means
is preparation. The beginning of the act is beginning. The meaning of the word
"yoga" has been explained before. The word "done" is used in the sutra to
indicate the independence of the agent. The word "caused" indicates dependence
on another's action. The word "permitted" is used to show the mental consequence
of the instigator. The characteristics described

## 250] **Sarvarthasiddhi** [619 § 625  **Kashaya** are anger, etc. The meaning
is distinguished from the inner meaning, this is the **vishesha**. It is
connected to each one - **samarambha vishesha**, **samarambha vishesha**, etc.
The first **jivaadhikaran** is distinguished by this **vishesha**, the remaining
part of the sentence is "**bhidyate**". These four **sujanta** words, "three"
etc., are connected in order - **samarambha**, **samarambha**, and **arambha**
are three, **yoga** are three, **krita**, **karita**, and **anumata** are three,
and **kashaya** are four. The repetition of their counting is indicated by the
**sucha** suffix. "**Ekasha**" is an indication of **vipsa**. The meaning is
that the three etc. distinctions should be applied to each one. For example,
**krodhakrita kayasamrambha**, **manakrita kayasamrambha**, **mayakrita

**mananumatakayasamrambha**, **mayanumatakayasamrambha**,
**lobhanumatakayasamrambha**. In this way, **kayasamrambha** is of twelve types.
Similarly, **vakyayoga** and **manoyoga** are also of twelve types. These are
all combined, making thirty-six distinctions. Similarly, **samarambha** and
**arambha** also have thirty-six distinctions each. These are all combined,
making 108 distinctions of **jivaadhikaran**. The word "**cha**" is used to
include the distinctions of **anantaanubandhi**, **apratyakhyana**,
**pratyakhyana**, and **sanjwalana** types of **kashaya**. 8625. To understand
the distinctions of the other **ajivaadhikaran**, the next sutra says -

respectively, in the form of **nirvartana**, **nikshepa**, **samyoga**, and
**nisarga**. ||9|| 8626. **Nirvartana** means **nishpadana**, i.e. creation.
**Nikshepa** means **sthapana**, i.e. placing. **Samyoga** means
**mishrikrita**, i.e. mixed. **Nisarga** means **pravartan**, i.e. initiation.
These are connected in order with two etc. -  The word "**karita**" is used to
show the expectation of the **prayogaka**. Similarly, the word "**anumata**" is
used to show the mental result of the **prayojaka**. The characteristics of
**kashaya** like anger, etc. have been mentioned. That which makes one meaning
distinct from another is **vishesha**. It should be connected with each word,
such as **samarambha vishesha**, **samarambha vishesha**, etc. Here,
"**bhidyate**" is the remaining part of the sentence, which means that the first
**jivaadhikaran** is distinguished by these characteristics. These four
**sucha**-suffixed words, "three" etc., are connected in order - **samarambha**,
**samarambha**, and **arambha** are three, **yoga** are three, **krita**,

---------------------------
## Chapter Six  There are six types of *nirvartana*, four types of *nikshepa*,
two types of *samyoga*, and three types of *nisarga*. These are the categories
of the non-living (*ajiva*).  **Doubt:** The word "other" (*para*) in the sutra
is meaningless, because the previous sutra mentioned "first" (*adya*), which
implies that this sutra refers to the remaining categories.  **Resolution:** The
word "other" (*para*) has a different meaning here. It indicates that
*nirvartana* etc. are different from *sanrambha* etc. Otherwise, if *nirvartana*
etc. were considered as the results of the soul (*atma*), then they would be
considered as categories of the living (*jiva*).  There are two types of
*nirvartana*: *mula-guna-nirvartana* and *uttar-guna-nirvartana*. *Mula-guna-
nirvartana* has five categories: body, speech, mind, *prana*, and *apana*.
*Uttar-guna-nirvartana* includes activities like carpentry, writing, and
painting.  There are four types of *nikshepa*: *apratyavekshit-nikshepa*,
*dushpramsht-nikshepa*, *sahasa-nikshepa*, and *anabhoga-nikshepa*.  There are
two types of *samyoga*: *bhakta-pana-samyoga* and *upakarana-samyoga*.  There
are three types of *nisarga*: *kaya-nisarga*, *vacana-nisarga*, and *mana-
nisarga*.  ## Explanation of the Sutra  The previous sutras discussed the
general categories of *karma-asrava*. Now, we will discuss the specific
categories of *karma-asrava*. To understand the categories of *asrava* for
*jnana-avaran* and *darshan-avaran*, the following sutra is presented:  **Sutra
10:** *Tattv-jnana* is the means to liberation. When someone praises *tattv-
jnana* but does not speak about it, it is called *pradosha*. When someone denies
knowledge or says "I don't know" due to some reason, it is called *nihnava*.
When someone has acquired knowledge but does not share it due to jealousy, it is
called *matsaraya*. When someone obstructs the path of knowledge, it is called
*antaraya*. When someone enjoys the fruits of knowledge without sharing it, it
is called *asadan*. When someone destroys the knowledge of others, it is called
*upaghata*. These are the *asravas* for *jnana-avaran* and *darshan-avaran*.  ##
Explanation of the Sutra  * **Pradosha:** When someone praises *tattv-jnana* but
does not speak about it, it is called *pradosha*. This is because they are
secretly jealous of others who have knowledge. * **Nihnava:** When someone
denies knowledge or says "I don't know" due to some reason, it is called
*nihnava*. This is because they are trying to hide their ignorance. *
**Matsarya:** When someone has acquired knowledge but does not share it due to
jealousy, it is called *matsaraya*. This is because they are afraid that others
will surpass them. * **Antaraya:** When someone obstructs the path of knowledge,
it is called *antaraya*. This is because they are trying to prevent others from
achieving liberation. * **Asadan:** When someone enjoys the fruits of knowledge
without sharing it, it is called *asadan*. This is because they are selfish and
only care about their own benefit. * **Upaghata:** When someone destroys the
knowledge of others, it is called *upaghata*. This is because they are trying to
prevent others from achieving liberation.  These six *asravas* are the main
obstacles to achieving liberation. They prevent us from acquiring knowledge and
developing our spiritual understanding. By overcoming these *asravas*, we can
progress on the path to liberation.

## 252] Sarvarthasiddhi [61118 629th chapter, the rejection of the knowledge of
the other's illumination is Asadanam. The corruption of praiseworthy knowledge
is Upadhatah. If it is said that this is Asadanam? Then, the acceptance of the
virtues of true knowledge, such as humility and giving, is Asadanam. Upadhatah
is the intention to destroy knowledge, considering knowledge as ignorance. This
is the difference between the two. The word 'Tat' refers to both knowledge and
vision. How can the reference of 'Tat' be made to the unmentioned and uncreated?
It is by question. When asked what is the Asrava of knowledge and vision, the
word 'Tat' refers to knowledge and vision in relation to that question. By this,
the defects like Pradosha etc. should be applied to knowledge, vision, and their
means, because they are the cause of them. These Pradosha etc. are the causes of
Asrava of knowledge and vision. The effect of one cause is seen in many ways,
therefore, even with the same Pradosha etc., the Asrava of both knowledge and
vision is established. Or, the Asrava is different due to the difference in the
subject matter. Pradosha etc. related to knowledge are the Asrava of knowledge,
and Pradosha etc. related to vision are the Asrava of vision. 8629. Just as the
Asrava of these two Karmas is of many types, so also - Dukha, Shoka, Tapa,
Akrandan, Vadh, and Paridevana, which are present in oneself, in others, or in
both, are the Asrava of Asatavedaniya Karma. ||1|| 8630. The result of the soul
in the form of suffering is Dukha. The special kind of dejection that arises
from the breaking of the relationship with the benefactor is Shoka. The intense
anguish of the mind caused by the occasion of reproach etc. is Tapa. The loud
crying expressed by tears, excessive lamentation etc. arising from regret is
Akrandan. The destruction of life, sense organs, strength, and breath is Vadh.
The dependence on the result of the affliction is Paridevana. The reason why it
is not given is envy. The destruction of knowledge is an obstacle. The
prohibition of another's illumination by body or speech is Asadanam. The
corruption of praiseworthy knowledge is Upadhatah. Doubt - The characteristic of
Upadhatah that has been described makes it appear as Asadanam? Solution - Not
being humble to praiseworthy knowledge, not praising its goodness etc. is
Asadanam. But, considering knowledge as ignorance and intending to destroy
knowledge is Upadhatah. Thus, there is a difference between the two. The word
'Tat' in the verse is used to refer to knowledge and vision. Doubt - Knowledge
and vision are uncreated, and they are not even mentioned, then how can their
knowledge be obtained through the word 'Tat' here? Solution - In relation to the
question, i.e., when asked what is the Asrava of knowledge and vision, the word
'Tat' refers to knowledge and vision. This implies that defects like Pradosha
etc. should be planned for those who have knowledge and vision, and for their
means, because they are caused by them. These Pradosha etc. are the causes of
Asrava of knowledge and vision Karma. The effect of one cause is seen in many
ways, therefore, even with the same Pradosha etc., the Asrava of both knowledge
and vision is established. Or, the Asrava is different due to the difference in
the subject matter. Pradosha etc. related to knowledge are the Asrava of
knowledge, and Pradosha etc. related to vision are the Asrava of vision. 8629.
Just as the Asrava of these two Karmas is of many types, so also - Dukha, Shoka,
Tapa, Akrandan, Vadh, and Paridevana, which are present in oneself, in others,
or in both, are the Asrava of Asatavedaniya Karma. ||1|| 8630. The result of the
soul in the form of suffering is Dukha. The special kind of dejection that
arises from the breaking of the relationship with the benefactor is Shoka. The
intense anguish of the mind caused by the occasion of reproach etc. is Tapa. The
loud crying expressed by tears, excessive lamentation etc. arising from regret
is Akrandan. The destruction of life, sense organs, strength, and breath is
Vadh. The dependence on the result of the affliction is Paridevana. 1. -lambanam

-61118 630] - Chapter Six [253  Weeping and lamenting with abundant compassion,
remembering and praising the qualities, and desiring the welfare of oneself and
others.  Is it not enough to simply accept that sorrow and the like are a
particular type of suffering?  It is true, but by explaining some specific
differences, the nature of suffering is revealed.  Just as when we say "cow," we
do not know the specific differences, so we use the terms "horned," "headless,"
"black," and "white" to explain them, similarly, when we say "suffering," we do
not know the countless differences in the world that arise from the flow of
suffering.  Therefore, by pointing out some specific differences, we understand
those specific differences.  These sorrows and the like are located within
oneself, in others, or in both, due to the influence of anger and the like.  All
of these should be known as the causes of the flow of the non-virtuous and the
knowable.  Here it is asked: If sorrow and the like, located within oneself, in
others, or in both, are the causes of the flow of the non-virtuous and the
knowable, why do those who follow the path of the Arhat believe in and teach
others about hair-plucking, fasting, and sun-bathing, which are causes of
suffering?  This is not a fault, because it is specifically stated that the
sorrows and the like that arise from the influence of anger and the like within
oneself are the causes of the flow of the non-virtuous and the knowable.  Just
as a physician, who is extremely compassionate, skillful, and restrained, does
not incur the bondage of sin when he causes pain to a patient by lancing a boil,
because it is only an external cause, similarly, a monk who is distressed by the
great suffering of the world, and whose mind is focused on the means to
eliminate it, does not incur the bondage of sin when he engages in actions
prescribed by the scriptures, because there are no karmic consequences.  It is
said: "Neither suffering nor happiness is seen in the means of treatment.  In
treatment, however, there may be suffering or happiness." 1.  Jatyantara-vidha

## 254] In the attainment of all good, Neither suffering nor happiness is the
cause of liberation, but a means to it. In the path of liberation, however,
there may be suffering or happiness.  8 631. The causes of the non-cognizable
karmas have been stated. Now, the causes of the cognizable karmas are to be
stated. They are: **Bhuta-Anukampa (compassion for all beings), Vrati-Anukampa
(compassion for those who observe vows), Dana (charity), Saraga-Samayamadi-Yoga
(the yoga of restraint with attachment), Kshanti (forbearance), and Saucha
(purity).**  8 632. Those who are in various states of existence due to the
ripening of karmas are called **Bhuta** (beings). This is a synonym for
**pranin** (living beings). The vows like ahimsa (non-violence) etc. will be
described later. Those who observe these vows are called **Vrati**. They are of
two types: those who have renounced the household life and are restrained, and
those who are householders and are restrained. **Anukampa** is the feeling of
compassion for others, arising from a heart filled with kindness, considering
their suffering as one's own. **Bhuta-Anukampa** is compassion for all beings,
and **Vrati-Anukampa** is compassion for those who observe vows. **Dana** is the
giving of one's possessions with the intention of benefiting others. **Saraga**
is one who is eager to renounce the causes of worldly existence, but whose
attachments have not yet been eradicated. **Samayama** is the restraint from
evil actions in relation to the senses and objects. **Saraga-Samayama** is the
restraint with attachment. The word **"adi"** (and so on) includes **Samayama-
Asamayama** (restraint and non-restraint), **Akamanirjara** (absence of desire),
**Balatapas** (minor austerities), and **Anurodha** (following the path).
**Yoga** is synonymous with **Samadhi** (concentration) and **Samyak-
Pranidhana** (right intention). The **Yoga** of **Bhuta-Anukampa, Vrati-
Anukampa, Dana, and Saraga-Samayamadi** is the practice of these with full
attention. **Kshanti** is the eradication of anger and other negative emotions.
**Saucha** is the abandonment of all forms of greed. The word **"iti"** (thus)
indicates the types. What are these types? They are: **Arhat-Puja-Karana-
Tatparata** (eagerness to worship the Arhats), **Balavruddh-Tapasvi-
Vaiyavrittya-Avaya** (the conduct of children, elders, ascetics, and those who
are indifferent).

## Chapter Six  [255]  Although the term 'Bhutas' includes 'Vratis', the term
'Vratis' is specifically mentioned in the sutra to emphasize the importance of
compassion towards them. These are all the Asravas of the Saataavedaniya.  8633.
Now, it is time to discuss the Asravas of the Mohaniya. First, we will discuss
the Asravas of the Darshan Mohaniya. The sutra says:  The Avर्णवाद of the
Kevali, Shruta, Sangh, Dharma, and Deva is the Asrava of the Darshan Mohaniya
Karma.  8634. Those whose knowledge is free from Avaranas are called Kevalis.
The Shruta is the compilation of scriptures written by the Ganadharas, who have
extraordinary intellect and remember the teachings of the Kevalis. The Sangh is
the community of Shramanas who are adorned with the three jewels. The Dharma is
the non-violence taught in the Agamas revealed by the omniscient. The Devas are
of four types, as mentioned earlier. Avर्णवाद is the act of attributing faults
to those who are virtuous and great. Avर्णवाद directed towards the Kevalis,
Shruta, Sangh, Dharma, and Devas is the cause of the Asrava of the Darshan
Mohaniya. For example, saying that the Kevalis live by begging is Avर्णवाद
towards the Kevalis. Saying that the scriptures allow meat-eating is Avर्णवाद
towards the Shruta. Saying that the Sangh are Shudras and impure is Avर्णवाद
towards the Sangh. Saying that the Dharma taught by the Jinas is devoid of
essence and those who follow it will become Asuras is Avर्णवाद towards the
Dharma. Saying that the Devas consume alcohol and meat is Avर्णवाद towards the
Devas.  8635. Now, the sutra discusses the Asravas of the second type of
Mohaniya, the Charitra Mohaniya:  The intense self-transformation caused by the
arising of Kshayas is the Asrava of the Charitra Mohaniya.  8636. The Kshayas
have been discussed earlier. Udya means ripening. The intense self-
transformation caused by the ripening of the Kshayas is the Asrava of the
Charitra Mohaniya.

-6118 8 644] Chapter Six 1257 The cause of hellish life is the excessive
beginning and attachment. The continuous performance of cruel deeds like
violence, greed, excessive attachment to worldly objects, black aura, fierce
meditation, and death-time characteristics are the causes of hellish life. 8639.
It has been said that the cause of hellish life is excessive beginning and
attachment. Now, the cause of animal life should be explained. Therefore, the
next sutra says: Maya is the cause of animal life. ||16|| 8640. Maya, which
arises from the special karma of character-delusion, is the crookedness of the
soul. It is also known as degradation. It is the cause of animal life. Its
detailed explanation is: spreading false doctrines mixed with true ones, leading
a life devoid of good conduct, being fond of excessive arguments, and having a
blue or pigeon-colored aura, anxious meditation, and death-time characteristics
are the causes of animal life. 8641. The cause of animal life has been
explained. Now, the cause of human life should be explained. Therefore, the next
sutra says: Little beginning and little attachment are the causes of human life.
||17|| 8642. The cause of hellish life has been explained. The opposite of that
is the cause of human life. This is the summary of this sutra. Its detailed
explanation is: having a gentle nature, being naturally virtuous, behaving with
good qualities, having few passions, and not having any distress at the time of
death are the causes of human life. 8643. Is this the only cause of human life,
or are there others? Therefore, the next sutra says: Gentleness of nature is
also the cause of human life. ||18|| 8644. Gentleness is the quality of being
soft. Gentleness of nature is being gentle by nature. This means that it is not
dependent on any instruction.

## 258] Sarvarthasiddhau  [61198645 This is also an asrava of the human
lifespan. Why is this made a separate sutra? The answer is that this is to show
that even the lifespan of the gods has this asrava. 8645. Is this the only
second asrava of the human lifespan? No, it is said that  Being devoid of good
conduct and vows is an asrava for all lifespans. ||19|| 8646. The word 'cha'
signifies the collection of the authorized asravas. This means that having a
small beginning and small possessions, as well as being devoid of good conduct
and vows, are all asravas for all lifespans. The nature of good conduct and vows
will be explained later. The state of being devoid of these is an asrava for all
lifespans. This is the meaning of this sutra. The word 'sarvesham' is used in
the sutra to show that this is an asrava for all lifespans. Question: Is being
devoid of good conduct and vows also an asrava for the lifespan of the gods?
Answer: Yes, it is an asrava for the lifespan of the gods, compared to the
beings of the bhogabhumi.  8647. Now, regarding what is the asrava of the fourth
lifespan, the next sutra says: Saraga-samyama, samyama-asamyama, akamanirjara,
and balatapa are the asravas of the gods. ||20|| 8648. Saraga-samyama and
samyama-asamyama have been explained before. Akamanirjara is the depletion
caused by the suppression of hunger, thirst, sexual desire, etc., which is
caused by the restraint of the charaka. Balatapa is the observance of vows with
a lot of bodily exertion, which is not useful for the path of liberation due to
wrong belief. These are all to be known as the causes of asrava for the lifespan
of the gods.

## Chapter Six  **8649.** Is this the only *āsrava* of the *devāyuka*? Or is
there more? The next *sūtra* explains: **Samyaktva** is also an *āsrava* of the
*devāyuka*. ||21||  **8650.** Doubt: Why? Resolution: Because of the separate
*sūtra*. Doubt: If this is the case, then the rule stated in the previous
*sūtra* applies generally, and it follows that *sarāga-samyama* and *samyama-
asamyama* are also *āsrava* of the *bhavanavāsī* etc. *āyu*. Resolution: This is
not a fault; because in the absence of *samyaktva*, *sarāga-samyama* and
*samyama-asamyama* do not exist, therefore both of them are included here. In
other words, these are also *āsrava* of the *saudharmā* etc. *devāyu*, because
they only exist when *samyaktva* is present.  **8651.** After *āyu*, the mention
of *nāma* *āsrava* is in order. To explain the *āsrava* of the *aśubha* *nāma*,
the next *sūtra* says: **Yoga-vakratā** and **visamvādana** are the *āsrava* of
the *aśubha* *nāma* *karma*. ||22||  **8652.** Three types of *yoga* have been
explained earlier. Its crookedness is *yoga-vakratā*. To act otherwise is
*visamvādana*. Doubt: There is no difference in meaning here, because *yoga-
vakratā* and acting otherwise are the same thing? Resolution: This is true, but
*yoga-vakratā* is said to be internal, while *visamvādana* is external. One who
is engaged in actions that are conducive to *samyag-udaya* and *niḥśreyasa*, to
hinder him by means of contrary thoughts, speech, and body is *visamvādana*. For
example, "Don't do this, do that." Thus, these two are not the same, but
different. Both of these should be known as the cause of the *āsrava* of the
*aśubha* *nāma* *karma*. The word "and" in the *sūtra* includes *mithyādarśana*,
*paiśunya*, *asthira-citta-tā*, *kūṭa-māna-tula-karaṇa*, *paranindā*, *ātma-
praśamsā*, etc.

Day 260] Sarvarthasiddhi [61238-653 $ 653. Now, the aphorism explains what are
the *āsrava* of *śubhanāmakarma*. The opposite of that, i.e., the *āsrava* of
*śubhanāmakarma* are simplicity and non-discord. ||23|| 8654. Simplicity of
body, speech, and mind, and non-discord are the opposite of that. By the word
'and', one should understand the opposite of those things which are combined
together. For example, seeing the *dharmic* persons and places, showing respect
and honour, maintaining harmony, *upanayana*, fear of the world, and abandoning
carelessness, etc. These are the causes of the *āsrava* of *śubhanāmakarma*.
8655. Question: Are these the only *āsrava* of *śubhanāmakarma*, or are there
any other special features? Answer: This *tīrthankara* *nāmakarma* is infinite,
unparalleled in its effects, the cause of inconceivable special *vibhūti*, and
the conqueror of the three worlds. Therefore, there are special features in its
*āsrava*. If this is so, then what are its *āsrava*? Therefore, starting from
this aphorism, Purity of vision, being endowed with humility, non-transgression
in conduct and vows, constant use of knowledge, constant *saṁvega*, renunciation
according to one's capacity, austerity according to one's capacity, *sādhu-
samādhi*, *vaiyāvṛtti*, devotion to *arihant*, devotion to *ācārya*, devotion to
*bahuśruta*, love of *pravacana*, not abandoning essential duties, influencing
the path of liberation, and love of *pravacana* are the *āsrava* of
*tīrthankara* *nāmakarma*. ||24|| $ 656. (1) The *nirgrantha* nature of the path
of liberation, as taught by the *jinas* (victorious ones), the *bhagavats*
(divine ones), the *arihants* (supreme beings), is to have a liking for it, and
purity of vision. Its special characteristics have been mentioned earlier. It
has eight parts: being free from doubt, being free from desire, being free from
uncertainty, having an unconfused vision, *upabṛhaṇa*, *sthitikaraṇa*,
*vātsalya*, and *prabhāvana*. (2) Respect, honour, and humility towards
*samyagjñāna*, etc., the path of liberation, and their means, such as the guru,
etc., according to one's capacity, being endowed with humility. Non-
transgression in the vows of non-violence, etc., and their observance, etc.  $
653. Now, the aphorism explains what are the *āsrava* of *śubhanāmakarma*. The
opposite of that, i.e., the *āsrava* of *śubhanāmakarma* are simplicity and non-
discord. ||23|| 8654. Simplicity of body, speech, and mind, and non-discord are
the opposite of that. By the word 'and', one should understand the opposite of
those things which are combined together. For example, seeing the *dharmic*
persons and places, showing respect and honour, maintaining harmony,
*upanayana*, fear of the world, and abandoning carelessness, etc. These are the
causes of the *āsrava* of *śubhanāmakarma*. 8655. Question: Are these the only
*āsrava* of *śubhanāmakarma*, or are there any other special features? Answer:
This *tīrthankara* *nāmakarma* is infinite, unparalleled in its effects, the
cause of inconceivable special *vibhūti*, and the conqueror of the three worlds.
Therefore, there are special features in its *āsrava*. If this is so, then what
are its *āsrava*? Therefore, starting from this aphorism, Purity of vision,
being endowed with humility, non-transgression in conduct and vows, constant use
of knowledge, constant *saṁvega*, renunciation according to one's capacity,
austerity according to one's capacity, *sādhu-samādhi*, *vaiyāvṛtti*, devotion
to *arihant*, devotion to *ācārya*, devotion to *bahuśruta*, love of
*pravacana*, not abandoning essential duties, influencing the path of
liberation, and love of *pravacana* are the *āsrava* of *tīrthankara*
*nāmakarma*. ||24|| $ 656. (1) The *nirgrantha* nature of the path of

-6125 §.657] Chapter Six [261 A flawless conduct in the virtues of non-anger,
etc., is the non-deviation from the vow of virtue. Constant application of right
knowledge in the true nature of the soul, etc., is the continuous use of
knowledge. Constant fear of the suffering of the world is the emotion.
Renunciation is charity. It is of three types: food charity, fearlessness
charity, and knowledge charity. It is called renunciation when it is used
according to the rules and to the best of one's ability. Austerity is the bodily
hardship that is not hidden and is not against the path. Just as a fire that has
arisen in a storehouse is extinguished because it is very beneficial, so also,
when an obstacle arises for a monk who is rich in vows and virtues, the
maintenance of his austerity is called samadhi. The removal of the suffering of
a virtuous person by a flawless method is called vaiyaavrutya. Affection with
purity of emotions towards Arhats, Acharyas, Bahushruta, and sermons is called
Arhat devotion, Acharya devotion, Bahushruta devotion, and sermon devotion.
Performing the six essential actions in due time is called essential
performance. The illumination of religion through knowledge, austerity, charity,
and Jina worship is called path propagation. Affection for fellow religionists,
like a cow for her calf, is called love for sermons. These are the sixteen
causes. If they are considered separately, they are the causes of the asava of
the Tirthankara name karma. If they are considered collectively, they are also
the causes of the asava of the Tirthankara name karma. § 657. After mentioning
the asavas of the name karma, it is now time to mention the asavas of the gotra
karma. In that too, the asavas of the low gotra are mentioned first. The next
sutra says: "Slandering others, praising oneself, covering up good qualities,
and promoting bad qualities are the asavas of the low gotra." || 2500 1.

##  Translation:  **262]**  **[6126 6 6588658.]** The desire to expose the truth
or falsehood or fault is called **ninda** (blame). The intention to reveal the
qualities is called **prashansa** (praise). The connection with the words
**para** (other) and **atma** (self) is in this order: **paraninda** (blame of
others) and **atmaprashansa** (self-praise). When there are obstacles, the non-
manifestation of the action due to the non-revealing attitude is called
**ucchadana** (concealment). When there are no obstacles, the manifestation of
the action due to the revealing attitude is called **udbhavana**
(manifestation). Here also, the connection is in this order: **sadgunocchadana**
(concealment of good qualities) and **asadgunodbhavana** (manifestation of bad
qualities). These are the causes of **asrava** (influx) for the **nicha**
(lower) **gotra** (lineage).   **[8659.]** Now, the cause of **asrava** for the
**ucca** (higher) **gotra** is explained in the following sutra:  **Tadvīparyayo
nīcaivṛttyanutseko coत्तरस्य ॥26॥**  **[8660.]** The word "**tat**" refers to
the **asrava** of the **nicha** **gotra** mentioned earlier. The opposite of the
attitude is called **vṛtti** **vīparyaya** (opposite attitude). The opposite of
that is **tadvīparyaya** (opposite of the opposite). What are these opposites?
**Atmaninda** (self-blame), **paraprashansa** (praise of others),
**sadgunodbhavana** (manifestation of good qualities), and **asadgunocchadana**
(concealment of bad qualities). Humility in those who are excellent in qualities
is called **nīcaivṛtti** (low attitude). Even though one is excellent in
knowledge, etc., not being proud of it, i.e., being free from ego, is called
**anutseka** (non-effort). These are the causes of **asrava** for the **ucca**
**gotra**.  **[8661.]** Now, the cause of **asrava** for the **antaraya**
(obstacle) karma, which comes after the **gotra**, is explained in the following
sutra:  **Vighnakaranamaantarāyasya ॥27॥**  **[8662.]**  **Dana** (giving),
etc., are mentioned in the sutra "**danalābhabhogopbhogavīryāṇi ca**".  To
obstruct these is the **asrava** of **antaraya** karma.

## Chapter Six  [6127 8 662]  **The sixth chapter**  [263] **Obstacle.** The act
of creating an obstacle is the **asrava** of **antaraya karma**. This should be
understood.  **Question:** It has been stated that **tatpradosha**, **nihnava**,
etc. are the causes of **asrava** for specific **karma** like **jnana-avaran**
and **darshan-avaran**. Are they the causes of **asrava** only for these
specific **karma** or for all **karma** in general?  If they are the causes of
**asrava** only for specific **karma** like **jnana-avaran** and **darshan-
avaran**, then it contradicts the **agama**. Because the **agama** states that
seven **karma** (excluding **ayu**) are constantly flowing **asrava** at every
moment. This would create a contradiction.  And if they are the causes of
**asrava** for all **karma** in general, then it is not appropriate to mention
them specifically.  **Answer:** Although **tatpradosha**, etc. do not have a
rule of binding specific **karma** like **jnana-avaran** and **darshan-avaran**,
they are still mentioned separately because they are the causes of binding
specific **anubhaga**.  Thus ends the sixth chapter of the **Tattvartha-vrutti**
named **Sarvartha-siddhi**. ||6||  **Explanation:**  We have discussed the
causes. Their destruction is an obstacle. And the act of creating this obstacle
is the **asrava** of **antaraya karma**.  **Doubt:** If **tatpradosha** and
**nihnava**, etc. are said to be the causes of **asrava** for specific **karma**
like **jnana-avaran** and **darshan-avaran**, are they the causes of **asrava**
only for these specific **karma** or for all **karma** in general?  If they are
the causes of **asrava** only for specific **karma** like **jnana-avaran** and
**darshan-avaran**, then it contradicts the **agama**, because the **agama**
states that seven **karma** (excluding **ayu**) are constantly flowing
**asrava** at every moment. This would create a contradiction.  And if they are
the causes of **asrava** for all **karma** in general, then it is not
appropriate to mention them specifically.  **Solution:** Although
**tatpradosha**, etc. do not have a rule of binding specific **karma** like
**jnana-avaran** and **darshan-avaran**, they are still mentioned separately
because they are the causes of binding specific **anubhaga**.  Thus ends the

## Chapter Seven  § 663. The meaning of *āsrava* has been explained. At the
beginning of its explanation, it was said, "Auspicious is the *puṇya*." This was
said in a general way. To understand its specific meaning, the question arises,
"What is auspicious?" The following *sūtra* answers this: "To be free from
violence, falsehood, stealing, non-celibacy, and attachment is a vow."  § 664.
*Sūtras* like "Violence is the harming of living beings due to carelessness" and
others, explain the nature of violence and the other things mentioned. To
refrain from them is called a vow. A vow is a rule that is taken upon oneself,
like "This is to be done, and this is not to be done."   **Objection:** Violence
and the other things mentioned are specific results, not permanent. How can they
be used in the ablative case?  **Solution:** The ablative case is used because
the intention is to indicate permanent cessation through understanding. For
example, in the phrase "He refrains from virtue," the person who is devoid of
understanding thinks, "Virtue is difficult, and its fruit is attainable only
through faith." Thus, he refrains from virtue due to his understanding.
Similarly, here, the person who acts with understanding thinks, "These results
of violence, etc., are the causes of sin. Those who engage in sinful actions are
punished by kings in this very life, and they suffer in the afterlife." Thus, he
refrains from violence, etc., due to his understanding. Therefore, it is
appropriate to use the ablative case because the intention is to indicate
permanent cessation through understanding.  The word *virati* should be combined
with each word individually. For example:  1. "The restraints are non-violence,
truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy, and non-attachment." (Pā. Yo. Sū. 2, 301)
2. "A vow is that which is taken upon oneself and is free from the objects of
*virati*." (Ratna. 3, 401) 3. "The ablative case is used for permanent
cessation." (Pā. 1, 4, 24) 4. "He refrains from virtue... This person is devoid
of understanding." (Pā. M. Bhā. 1, 4, 3, 24) 5. "He refrains from virtue due to
his understanding." (Pā. M. Bhā. 1, 4, 3, 24) 6. "This person acts with
understanding." (Mā. M. Bhā. 1, 4, 3, 24) 7. "They suffer in the afterlife due
to their understanding." (Mu., Vā. Nā.)

## Chapter Seven  [265]  The five vows are mentioned starting with non-violence.
Non-violence is the most important vow, as the other vows, like truthfulness,
are for its protection, like a fence around a field of grain. There is one vow
in relation to Samayika, which is characterized by the cessation of all faults.
The same vow is described as five-fold in relation to the cessation of the
causes of rebirth.   **Doubt:** This vow cannot be the cause of the flow of
karmic matter, as it is included in the causes of restraint. Restraint will be
explained later as including secrecy, etc.  There are ten types of Dharma, and
one of them is called Samyama. Are the vows included in Samyama?
**Resolution:** This is not a fault, because restraint will be explained as
cessation, and here we see activity. This is because the abandonment of
violence, untruthfulness, and taking what is not given, leads to the activity of
non-violence, truthfulness, and accepting what is given. These vows are also the
means of restraint, such as secrecy, etc.  A person who has practiced the vows
properly can easily practice restraint, so they are taught separately.
**Doubt:** There is a sixth Anuvrata called refraining from eating at night.
Should this be included here?  **Resolution:** No, because it is included in the
practices of mindfulness. The practices of mindfulness of non-violence will be
explained later. One of these practices is mindfulness of food and drink taken
in the light.  8665. To explain the difference between these five vows, the next
sutra says: "From violence, etc., restraint in one place is Anuvrata, and
restraint in all places is Mahavrata."  § 666. The word "desh" means "one
place," and the word "sarva" means "all." In the sutra, the words "desh" and
"sarva" are combined in a compound word with the suffix "tas," forming the word
"desh-sarvatah." The word "virati" is understood from the previous sutra. Here,
the words "anu" and "mahat" are combined in a compound word, forming the word
"anu-mahati." The word "vrata" is neuter gender, so the word "anu-mahati" is
used in the neuter gender. These are related in order. For example, restraint in
one place is Anuvrata, and

## Chapter Seven  **§ 678**  [267]  **8673.**  Residing in empty buildings,
caves in mountains, hollows in trees, etc. is called *śūnyāgārāvāsa*. Residing
in houses abandoned by others is called *vimocitāvāsa*. Not hindering others
from staying is called *paroparodhākaraṇa*. Taking alms according to the rules
of conduct is called *bhaikṣaśuddhi*. Not disagreeing with co-religionists by
saying "this is mine, this is yours" is called *sadharmāvisamvāda*. These are
the five *bhāvanās* of the *adattādānaviramana* vow.  **8674.** Now, the
*bhāvanās* of the *brahmacarya* vow should be explained. Therefore, the next
*sūtra* says:  Giving up listening to stories that arouse desire for women,
giving up looking at their beautiful limbs, giving up remembering past
pleasures, giving up aphrodisiac and desired tastes, and giving up the
conditioning of one's own body - these are the five *bhāvanās* of the
*brahmacarya* vow. || 7 ||  **§ 675.** The word *tyāga* should be combined with
each word. For example: giving up listening to stories that arouse desire for
women (*strīrāgakathā-śravaṇatyāga*), giving up looking at their beautiful limbs
(*tanmanoharaṅganirīkṣaṇatyāga*), giving up remembering past pleasures
(*pūrvartānusmaraṇatyāga*), giving up aphrodisiac and desired tastes
(*vṛṣyeṣṭarasatyāga*), and giving up the conditioning of one's own body
(*svaśarīrasamskāratyāga*) - these are the five *bhāvanās* of the *brahmacarya*
vow.  **§ 676.** Now, the next *sūtra* explains what the *bhāvanās* of the fifth
vow are:  Giving up attachment and aversion to the objects of the senses, both
pleasant and unpleasant, are the five *bhāvanās* of the *aparagraha* vow. || 8
||  **8677.** When the five senses, such as touch, come into contact with
pleasant and unpleasant objects, giving up attachment and aversion to these five
objects of touch, etc., are the five *bhāvanās* of the *ākiccaniya* vow.  **§
678.** Just as these *bhāvanās* are understood for the sake of strengthening
these vows, so also, for the sake of strengthening these vows, what should be
done in relation to their opposites? The next *sūtra* explains this.

In the **Sarvarthasiddhi**, it is stated that the vision of **apaya** (negative
consequences) and **avady** (blameworthy actions) in **himsa** (violence) and
other **five vices** is essential both in this life and the next.   **Apaya**
refers to the destruction of actions leading to **abhyudaya** (worldly
prosperity) and **nishreyasa** (spiritual liberation). **Avady** signifies
blameworthy actions. The vision of both **apaya** and **avady** is crucial to
understand the consequences of these vices.  **Violence:** A violent person is
constantly subjected to distress and burdened by animosity. In this life, they
face punishments like death, imprisonment, and suffering. After death, they are
destined for an unfavorable rebirth and are considered blameworthy. Therefore,
abandoning violence is the most beneficial path.  **False Speech:** A liar is
untrustworthy and faces consequences like tongue-cutting in this life. They also
suffer from the pain inflicted by those who have been deceived by their lies and
face animosity from them. After death, they are destined for an unfavorable
rebirth and are considered blameworthy. Therefore, abandoning false speech is
the most beneficial path.  **Stealing:** A thief, obsessed with stealing others'
possessions, is despised by all. In this life, they face punishments like
torture, death, imprisonment, and mutilation of limbs. After death, they are
destined for an unfavorable rebirth and are considered blameworthy. Therefore,
abandoning stealing is the most beneficial path.  **Unchastity:** An unchaste
person is driven by lust and behaves like a wild elephant separated from its
mate, facing suffering and punishments like death, imprisonment, and torture.
Their mind, clouded by lust, is incapable of discerning right from wrong. They
indulge in sexual misconduct, leading to animosity and punishments like
castration, death, imprisonment, and loss of possessions. After death, they are
destined for an unfavorable rebirth and are considered blameworthy. Therefore,
abandoning unchastity is the most beneficial path.  **Attachment:** Just as a
bird, attracted to a piece of meat, is attacked by other birds, a person
attached to possessions faces similar consequences.

## Chapter Seven  [269] Restraint is beneficial for the self. Just as a bird
with a piece of meat in its beak is vulnerable to attack by other birds like
crows, similarly, one who is attached to possessions is vulnerable to attack by
others. They also incur many faults related to earning, protecting, and losing
possessions. They never feel satisfied, just like fire is never satisfied with
fuel. Due to excessive greed, they lose the ability to discern between right and
wrong actions. After death, they are born in an unfavorable realm. They are also
despised as greedy. Therefore, it is beneficial to renounce possessions. In this
way, one should contemplate the harm and evil of violence and other vices.
[680] To explain the contemplation of violence and other vices, the following
sutra is stated:  **They are indeed suffering.** [10]  [8681] One should
contemplate that violence and other vices are indeed suffering. How are violence
and other vices suffering? Because they are the cause of suffering. Just as it
is said, "Food is life," because food is the cause of life, we refer to food as
life. Similarly, violence and other vices are the cause of non-virtuous karma,
and non-virtuous karma is the cause of suffering. Therefore, violence and other
vices are suffering, either because they are the cause of suffering or because
they are the cause of the cause of suffering. This contemplation of violence and
other vices as suffering should be done with self-awareness and awareness of
others.  **Objection:** All of these things are not necessarily suffering,
because there is pleasure in enjoying sense objects.  **Response:** The apparent
pleasure derived from enjoying sense objects is not true pleasure, but merely a
temporary relief from pain, like scratching an itch.  [8682] The following sutra
explains another aspect of contemplation:

## 270] Sarvarthasiddhi  [71118683 Maitri, Pramoda, Karuna, and Madhyasthya are
the qualities of the soul, which are to be cultivated in the Sattva, Gunadhika,
Klishyamana, and Avineya respectively. ||1|| 8683. Maitri is the desire for the
absence of suffering in others. Pramoda is the inner joy expressed through
facial expressions and other means. Karuna is the feeling of compassion for the
suffering. Madhyasthya is the absence of partiality based on attachment and
aversion. The souls, called Sattva, are born in various births due to the
consequences of their past actions. Those who have developed excellent qualities
like Samyagjnana are called Gunadhika. Those who are suffering due to the
arising of Asadyodaya are called Klishyamana. Those who do not have the
qualities of hearing and understanding the truth are called Avineya. In these
Sattva, etc., one should cultivate Maitri, etc., respectively. Maitri towards
all beings, Pramoda towards Gunadhika, Karuna towards Klishyamana, and
Madhyasthya towards Avineya. By cultivating these feelings, one attains
perfection in the vows of Ahimsa, etc.  8684. Further, the text says: "For the
sake of Samvega and Vairagya, one should contemplate the nature of the world and
the body. ||12|| 8685. The nature of the world is that it is beginningless,
endless, and like a bamboo stick, a sieve, and a drum. In this beginningless
cycle of existence, the soul wanders through various births, experiencing
suffering for an infinite time. Nothing is permanent here. Life is like a water
bubble, and material possessions are fleeting like lightning and rainbows. By
contemplating the nature of the world in this way, one develops aversion to the
world. The nature of the body is that it is impermanent, the cause of suffering,
empty, and impure. In this way, one should contemplate the nature of the body.
1. 'Maitri, Karuna, Mudita, and Upeksha are the feelings that arise towards
happiness, suffering, virtue, and vice respectively. These feelings purify the
mind.' - Pa. Yo. Su. 1, 33.  2. 'Cleanliness, disgust towards one's own body,
and aversion to contact with others.' - Pa. Yo. Su. 2, 40.

-7113 $ 687] Chapter Seven [271 Contemplation of the nature of the body leads to
detachment from attachment to objects. Therefore, one should contemplate the
nature of the world and the body. 8686. Here the questioner says, "You have said
that the vow is to abstain from violence, etc., but we do not know what specific
actions constitute violence, etc." To this, it is said: It is impossible to
explain all of them at once, but their characteristics can be explained in
sequence. Therefore, to explain the nature of what was mentioned at the
beginning, the following sutra is said: Violence is the killing of living beings
due to heedlessness. ||13|| 8687. Heedlessness is the state of being accompanied
by passions, and the result of the soul being in that state is called heedless.
The action of the heedless is called heedless action. Therefore, violence is
defined as the separation, as far as possible, of the ten vital breaths,
including the senses, due to heedless action. This is the cause of suffering for
living beings, and therefore the cause of unrighteousness. The qualifier "due to
heedless action" is used to indicate that only the separation of vital breaths
does not constitute unrighteousness. It is also said: "Even if this being
separates another from its vital breaths, it is not considered violence." And it
is also said: "If a small creature is crushed by the foot of a sage who is
engaged in walking, and dies as a result, there is no mention of even a small
amount of bondage due to that cause in the scriptures. Because, just as fainting
is considered to be a form of attachment from a spiritual perspective, here too,
the result of passions, etc., is considered to be violence." Doubt: Even if the
vital breaths are not destroyed, is violence still considered to be committed
merely due to heedless action? It is also said: 1. Bhagavata Mu., Ta., Na. 2.

## 272] **Sarvarthasiddhi**  [71148688  "A person who is devoid of *yatnaachar*
(effortful conduct) commits violence even if he is living a life of *jiva*
(living being). A person who practices *yatnaachar* does not incur bondage even
if he commits violence." This is not a fault. Here also, there is the
destruction of life, which is the characteristic of the emotion. Thus, it is
said: "A careless soul destroys himself by himself. Whether the killing of other
beings in the past is followed by killing in the future or not." 8688. The
characteristic of violence has been stated. Now, the next *sutra* (aphorism)
states the characteristic of untruth, which is stated after violence. Untruth is
the statement of what is not true. ||14|| 8 689. The word *sat* (true) is
indicative of praise. That which is not *sat* is *asat* (false). The statement
of what is not true is untruth. *Rta* (truth) is *satya* (truth), and what is
not *rta* is *anrta* (untruth). What then is *aprashastha* (unpraiseworthy)?
That which causes suffering to living beings is *aprashastha*, whether it is
related to an existing object or a non-existing object. It has been said earlier
that the remaining vows are for the protection of the vow of non-violence.
Therefore, one should be certain that speech that causes violence is untruth. 8
690. Now, the next *sutra* states the characteristic of theft, which is stated
after untruth. Taking what is not given is theft. ||15|| 8691. *Adana* (taking)
means taking. Taking what is not given is *adattadana*, and this is called
*steya* (theft). If this is so, then taking what is not given, like karma and
speech, would also be theft, because it is not given by another? This is not a
fault, because the practice of *steya* is only applicable where giving and
taking are possible. 'Even if a person who is devoid of *yatnaachar* lives a
life of *jiva*, he commits violence according to the rules. And a person who
practices *yatnaachar* does not incur bondage even if he commits violence.'
Solution-This is not a fault, because here also, there is the destruction of
life, which is the characteristic of the emotion. It is also said: 'A careless
soul destroys himself by himself. Whether the killing of other beings in the
past is followed by killing in the future or not.' 868 8. The characteristic of

What is *aprashastha* (unpraiseworthy)? Solution-That which causes suffering to

Jain terms preserved in the translation:  The Seventh Chapter [273] From where?
Due to the capacity of 'adatta' (taking what is not given) acquisition. Even if
the monk wanders in towns, cities, etc., does he obtain 'adattadana' (taking
what is not given) by entering through the streets, gates, etc.? No, there is no
fault; because of general liberation. Thus, this monk does not enter the closed
doors, etc. because of non-liberation. Or, it continues with 'pramattayogat'
(due to negligence). What is taken due to negligence is called 'steya' (theft).
And there is no negligence in the one who enters the streets, etc. Thus, it is
said that where there is activity due to the transformation of affliction, there
is 'steya' in the acquisition or non-acquisition of external objects.  8692.
Now, the fourth 'abrahma' (non-celibacy) is described. Mithuna (sexual
intercourse) is 'abrahma'. ||16|| 8693. When the rise of 'charitra-mohaniya'
(deluding karma that destroys right conduct) occurs, the desire for mutual touch
of the male and female afflicted by the transformation of attachment is called
'mithuna'. The activity of 'mithuna' is called 'maithuna'. Not all activity is
so. Why? Because it is well-known in the world and scriptures. In the world, the
activity of cowherds, etc. motivated by the transformation of attachment between
male and female is called 'maithuna'. In the scriptures too, it is understood in
the same way, as in "the desire for 'mithuna' in horses and bulls". Also,
'pramattayogat' continues, so the activity for the sake of sexual pleasure
between male and female is understood as 'maithuna', not everything. The virtues
like non-violence, etc. are not considered as 'karma' (activity).

274] Sarvarthasiddhi 171178294That which, when protected, grows and prospers is
called Brahma. That which is devoid of it is called Abrahama. What is it? It is
Maithuna. In it, vices like violence flourish. Because one who is inclined
towards sexual indulgence, harms both mobile and immobile beings, speaks
falsehood, takes what is not given, and accepts both conscious and unconscious
possessions. 6694. Now, to explain the characteristics of the fifth possession,
the next sutra says: Moochha is possession. ||17|| 8695. Now, the nature of
Moochha is explained. Question: What is Moochha? Answer: The protection,
acquisition, and cultivation of external objects like cows, buffaloes, gems,
pearls, etc., both conscious and unconscious, and internal objects like
attachment, etc., is Moochha. Question: In the world, there is a common
understanding that a particular aggravation of wind, etc., is called Moochha.
Why is this not considered here? Answer: This is true, but the general meaning
of the root Moochha is delusion, and general words are applicable to their
specific meanings. Therefore, the specific meaning of Moochha is considered
here, because the topic is possession. Question: Even with this meaning of
Moochha, external objects do not become possessions, because Moochha refers to
the collection of internal possessions. Answer: This is correct, because the
internal is considered the primary, and therefore, only the internal is
collected. It is clear that even without external possessions, a person who has
the thought "this is mine" is still possessed. Question: If external objects are
not possessions, and if the thought "this is mine" is possession because it is
the cause of Moochha, then knowledge, etc., also become possessions, because
like the results of attachment, etc., there is also the thought "this is mine"
in knowledge, etc.? Answer: This is not a fault, because "due to
inattentiveness" is implied. Therefore, knowledge, perception, and conduct of an
attentive person are not possessions. 1. Abrahama. What is Mu.। 2 Conscious and

## Chapter Seven  **71188697**  The absence of delusion does not lead to
unconsciousness, thus proving the absence of attachment. Furthermore, since
knowledge, perception, and conduct are not objects of attachment and are
inherent qualities of the soul, they are not subject to attachment. However,
passions like attachment, aversion, and delusion arise from karmic activity and
are not inherent qualities of the soul, making them objects of attachment.
Therefore, the intention to possess them is considered attachment. All vices
stem from this root. When the intention "this is mine" arises, it leads to
actions like protection and preservation. These actions inevitably lead to
violence. To achieve these ends, one resorts to falsehood, theft, and sexual
misconduct. These actions result in various forms of suffering in hell and other
realms.  **8696**  This chapter explains the characteristics of a person who
observes the vices of violence, etc., and whose mind is devoted to the virtues
of non-violence, etc., and who strives diligently to practice these virtues.
Such a person, who observes the vows of non-violence, etc., is known as:  **A
person free from the "arrow" (शल्य) is a vow-keeper (व्रती) || 18 ||**  **8697**
The word "शल्य" (arrow) is derived from the root "शृणाति हिनस्ति" (to pierce, to
injure). It signifies anything that causes pain. When a thorn or other sharp
object enters the body, it is called a "शल्य". Similarly, any mental or physical
affliction is also referred to as a "शल्य". Just as a thorn causes harm to
living beings, karmic afflictions, which cause mental and physical suffering,
are also considered "शल्य". There are three types of "शल्य":  * **Maya-Shalya
(Illusionary Arrow):** This refers to deception, trickery, and cunning. *
**Nidana-Shalya (Cause-Arrow):** This refers to the desire for worldly pleasures
and possessions. * **Mithyadarshan-Shalya (False Perception Arrow):** This
refers to belief in falsehoods and lack of faith in truth.  A person who is free
from these three types of "शल्य" is called a "Nishshalya Vrati" (a vow-keeper
free from the arrow).  **Objection:**  One might argue that a person is called a
"Vrati" (vow-keeper) because they observe the vows, not because they are free
from the "Shalya". Just as Devadatta is not a king because he is associated with
a scepter, but because he possesses the qualities of a king.  **Response:**  The
objection is not valid because the phrase "प्रमत्तयोगात्" (due to negligence) is
applicable here. A person who possesses knowledge, perception, and conduct, and
is free from negligence, does not experience delusion. This absence of delusion
proves the absence of attachment.

## 276] **Sarvarthasiddhi** [7119 § 698 Because of the superiority of the [true]
vow. A vow is not merely related to the abstention from violence, etc., without
the absence of blemishes. When blemishes are removed, a vow-taker is designated
as such due to the relationship with the vow, just like a cow with much milk and
ghee is called a "cow with much milk and ghee." In the absence of much milk and
ghee, even if there are cows, they are not called "cows with much milk and
ghee." Similarly, even if there are vows, one is not a vow-taker if there are
blemishes. But one who is free from blemishes is a vow-taker. $ 698 To
understand the difference, it is said: **Agari and Anagari** ||19|| 8699.
"Agara" means a house, which is embraced by those who seek refuge. One who has a
house is "Agari." One who does not have a house is "Anagari." There are two
types of vow-takers: Agari and Anagari. **Objection:** But here, a contradiction
arises. A muni who resides in an empty house or a temple would be "Agari"
according to the above definition. And one who has not renounced the desire for
objects, but has left home for some reason and lives in the forest, would be
"Anagari." **Solution:** This is not a fault, because "Bhavagara" is intended
here. When the rise of the desire for worldly objects is overcome, the result
that is not renounced from the house is called "Bhavagara." One who has this is
"Agari," even if he lives in the forest. And one who does not have this, even if
he lives in a house, is "Anagari." **Objection:** An "Agari" cannot be a vow-
taker, because he does not have complete vows. **Solution:** This is not a
fault, because even an "Agari" can be a vow-taker, like a resident of a city, in
comparison to the Nayas of Naigama, etc. Just as one who lives in a house or a
hut is still said to "live in the city," similarly, one who does not have
complete vows is still a vow-taker in comparison to the Nayas of Naigama,
Sangraha, and Vyavahara. + One cannot be a vow-taker simply by being related to
the vow without being free from blemishes. For example, Devadatta cannot be an
umbrella just because he has a stick in his hand. **Solution:** To be a vow-
taker, one must possess both qualities. If someone has not renounced blemishes
and has only abandoned violence, etc., then he cannot be a vow-taker. Here, a
vow-taker is desired who has renounced blemishes and accepted vows. Just as one
who has a lot of ghee and milk is called a "cow with much milk and ghee." If he
does not have ghee and milk, even if he has cows, he is not called a "cow with
much milk and ghee." Similarly, even if there are vows, one is not a vow-taker
if there are blemishes. But one who is free from blemishes is a vow-taker. 8698.
Now, to explain the differences, the next sutra says: **He is Agari and
Anagari.** ||19|| 8 699. "Agara" is what those who seek refuge embrace. "Agara"
means a house. One who has a house is "Agari." And one who does not have a house
is "Anagari." Thus, there are two types of vow-takers: Agari and Anagari.
**Doubt:** The definition of Agari and Anagari given above leads to a
contradictory meaning. According to the above definition, a muni who resides in
an empty house or a temple would be "Agari." And one who has not renounced the
desire for objects, but has left home for some reason and lives in the forest,
would be "Anagari." **Solution:** This is not a fault, because "Bhavagara" is
intended here. When the rise of the desire for worldly objects is overcome, the
result that is not renounced from the house is called "Bhavagara." One who has
this is "Agari," even if he lives in the forest. And one who does not have this,
even if he lives in a house, is "Anagari." **Doubt:** An "Agari" cannot be a
vow-taker, because he does not have complete vows. **Solution:** This is not a
fault, because even an "Agari" can be a vow-taker, like a resident of a city, in
comparison to the Nayas of Naigama, etc. Just as one who lives in a house or a
hut is still said to "live in the city," similarly, one who does not have
complete vows is still a vow-taker in comparison to the Nayas of Naigama,
Sangraha, and Vyavahara. 1,  मात्रसम्ब  मु.। 2. प्नोति नैष आ., दि. 1, दि. 21 3

Ah -7121 $ 702] Chapter Seven [277] It is explained. 8700. Here it is said, "Is
one who has renounced one of the five great vows, an Agari?" No. What then? It
is said that one who has renounced all five vows with a vow of restraint is
called an Agari. An Agari is one who has taken the Anuvratas. ||20|| 8701. The
word 'Anu' means 'small'. One who has small vows is called an Agari. How are his
vows small? Because it is not possible for him to renounce all the five great
vows completely. From what is he renounced? He is renounced from harming living
beings, therefore his first Anuvrata is Ahimsa. Due to attachment and delusion,
he renounces false speech because it can lead to the destruction of his home and
village, therefore his second Anuvrata is Satya. A Shravak renounces taking what
is not given because it is harmful to others and due to fear of the king, etc.,
but he still has a desire for it, therefore his third Anuvrata is Asteya. He
renounces sexual intercourse with another's wife, whether she is accepted or
not, therefore his fourth Anuvrata is Brahmacharya. He limits his possessions of
wealth, grain, land, etc., according to his needs, therefore his fifth Anuvrata
is Aparigraha. $702. It is said, "Does an Agari who has not renounced his home
have only these characteristics, or are there any others?" It is said that he is
also endowed with the vows of Digvirati, Deshvirati, Anarthadandavirati,
Samayikavat, Proshadhopavasavat, Upbhogparibhogparimanat, and Atithisambhagavat.

[278] In the attainment of all good - [71218  703 $ 703. The word 'virati'
applies to each. Digvirati, deshvirati, anarthadandavirati, these three are
gunavrata; because the word 'vrata' is connected with each. Similarly,
samayaikavrata, proshadhopavasavrata, upbhogparibhogparimanavrata,
atithisambhagavrata, these four are shikshavrata. One who is endowed with these
vrata is called a grihi virata-avirata. For example, the directions east etc.,
by setting a limit with the help of well-known signs, is digvirativrata. Beyond
that, the abandonment of violence towards the trembling and stationary beings,
is mahavrat in that extent. Even if there is gain beyond that limit, the
abandonment of the result, leads to the abandonment of greed. The area with a
definite limit of villages etc., is called desh. The abandonment of going beyond
that is deshvirativrata. Here also, as before, mahavrat is attained beyond the
limit. The action which is not beneficial and is only the cause of sin, is
anarthadand. To be free from it is anarthadandavirativrata. Anarthadand is of
five types - apadhyan, papopadehs, pramadacharit, hinsapradan, and
ashubhashruti. To think in the mind, how can there be victory, defeat, killing,
binding, cutting of limbs, and taking away of others' wealth etc., is apadhyan.
To speak words full of sin, in matters like causing suffering to the animals,
promoting trade, and the beginning of violence towards living beings etc., is
papopadehs. To do sinful actions like cutting trees, digging the earth, watering
etc., without any purpose, is pramadacharit. To give poison, thorns, weapons,
fire, rope, whip, and wood etc., the instruments of violence, is hinsapradan. To
listen to and teach evil stories which increase violence and anger etc., is
ashubhashruti. 'Sam' prefix is 1. Vratam. These are M. 2. Abandonment of the
five sins in the place other than the boundary. Mahavrata is attained by the
space of the country. Ratna. 3,5. 3. Manapradesho Mu. 4.

## Chapter Seven  **Giving aid to violence or violence itself is violence.
Listening to, teaching, or engaging in evil stories that promote violence,
anger, and other negative emotions is considered an evil sound. The term "same"
(sameeka) refers to unity. For example, when we say "ghee is good, oil is good,"
we understand that "good" means unified. "Samaya" is the time of unity, and
"Samayika" is the same as "Samaya." Alternatively, "Samayika" is the purpose of
unity.  **  **One should understand that a person who is in "Samayika" for a
certain period of time in a certain place is a "Mahavrat" (one who has taken the
five great vows) just like before. Why? Because they have renounced all forms of
violence, both subtle and gross. **  **Question:** If this is the case, then
does a person in "Samayika" experience complete restraint?   **Answer:** No,
because the karmas that destroy restraint arise.   **Question:** Then does this
person lack the "Mahavrat"?  **Answer:** No, because it is understood through
analogy, just like how "Chaitra" is considered ubiquitous in a royal family.
**"Proshadha" refers to a festival. Fasting means abstaining from the objects of
the five senses, such as sound, etc., and dwelling in the festival. In other
words, fasting means abstaining from four types of food. Fasting during the
"Proshadha" festival is called "Proshadhopavas."**  **A "Shravak" (lay follower)
who is observing "Proshadhopavas" should abstain from bathing, perfumes,
garlands, and ornaments due to the purification of their body. They should
reside in a sacred place, a place of residence for the virtuous, a "Chaityalaya"
(temple), or their designated "Proshadhopavas" house. They should engage their
mind in listening to, reciting, and contemplating religious teachings. They
should remain in a state of fasting and refrain from all beginnings. **  **Food,
drink, perfumes, and garlands are considered "Upbhog" (consumption). Clothing,
coverings, ornaments, beds, seats, houses, vehicles, and other things are
considered "Paribhog" (enjoyment). The quantity of these two is called "Upbhog

## 2801 **Sarvarthasiddhi** [7122 § 704 Vehicles, ornaments, and other
possessions are called *vyavahara*. Limiting their use is the *vyavahara-
parimana* vow. One whose mind is free from violence should forever renounce
honey, meat, and alcohol. One should also renounce flowers like *ketki* and
*arjuna*, as well as ginger and radish, because they are the basis of the birth
of many beings and are called *ananta-kaya*. This is because their consumption
brings little benefit and harms many beings. One should consider that only a
limited amount of vehicles, ornaments, etc., is beneficial for us, while the
rest is harmful. Thus, one should renounce whatever is harmful for a certain
period or for life, as per one's capacity.  One who walks without destroying
*samyama* is called an *atithi*. Alternatively, one whose arrival has no fixed
date is called an *atithi*. This means that one whose arrival time is not fixed
is called an *atithi*. To make arrangements for such an *atithi* is called
*atithi-samvibhaga*. It is of four types: *bhiksha*, *upakarana*, *aushadha*,
and *pratiśraya*, i.e., lodging. One who is dedicated to liberation, devoted to
*samyama*, and pure should be given pure and faultless *bhiksha* with a pure
mind. One should give *dharmopakarana* that enhances *samyagdarshana*, etc. One
should also provide appropriate *aushadha*. And one should provide lodging with
utmost faith in the Dharma. The word 'cha' in the sutra is used to indicate the
collection of household duties that will be mentioned later. $ 704. What else is
there? And one who joyfully practices *maranantika sallekhana* is also an
*atithi*. ||22|| $ 705. The destruction of lifespan, senses, and the three
powers of mind, speech, and body, due to specific causes, is called death. The
word 'anta' is used in the sutra to indicate the knowledge of death in that very
existence. Death is the end, *marananta*. One whose purpose is this *marananta*
is called *maranantika*. The proper inscription of the body and the passions is
called *sallekhana*. This means the proper inscription of the external body and
the internal passions, along with the gradual elimination of their causes. One
who practices *maranantika sallekhana* with joy is called *maranantika*.

[281 -7122 8705] Chapter Seven is connected. Should it be said that it is served
with clear meaning? No; because of the possibility of a special meaning. It is
not only served here. What then? It is also for pleasure. Because, if there is
no pleasure in the truth, then the Sallekhana is not performed by force. The one
who is truly pleased does it himself. Would it be an opinion that he is
committing suicide; because of the abandonment of life, etc., with his own
intention?  :: Because of non-negligence. It has been said, "Killing of life due
to negligence is violence." And he is not negligent. Why? Because of the absence
of attachment, aversion, and delusion. For one who is possessed by attachment,
aversion, and delusion, due to the use of poison and weapons, etc., according to
the science of poisons, he commits suicide. The one who has taken Sallekhana
does not have attachment, etc., therefore he is not guilty of self-destruction.
And it is said, "It is seen in this time that the absence of attachment, etc.,
is non-violence. The Jinas have declared their arising to be violence." And,
because death is undesirable, just as a merchant engaged in giving, taking, and
accumulating various goods does not desire the destruction of his own house. And
if, due to circumstances, the causes of its destruction arise, he removes them
as much as possible. And if they cannot be removed, he strives so that the goods
are not destroyed. Similarly, a householder, engaged in the accumulation of the
goods of vows and conduct, does not desire the fall of his support. By reducing
the causes that nourish the body and the passions, gradually, doing good
writing, i.e., cultivating, is Sallekhana. The meaning of this sutra is that the
householder who serves this Sallekhana, which takes place at the end of death,
with pleasure.  Doubt: To make the meaning clear in a natural way, it is right
to say "served" in place of "nourished" in the sutra. Solution: No; because by
keeping the action "nourished", a special meaning is conveyed from it. Here, not
only the meaning of "serving" is taken, but also the meaning of "pleasure",
because if there is no pleasure, Sallekhana is not performed by force. But if
there is pleasure, the being himself performs Sallekhana. The meaning is that
the meaning of "serving with pleasure" comes out from the action "nourished",
not from "served", therefore the action "nourished" has been kept in the sutra.
Doubt: Since in Sallekhana, life, etc., is abandoned with one's own intention,
therefore is it suicide? Solution: This is not a fault, because there is no
negligence in Sallekhana. It has been said before, "Killing of life due to
negligence is violence." But there is no negligence in this, because attachment,
etc., are not found in it. One who is possessed by attachment, aversion, and
delusion, and who, by using poison and weapons, etc., commits suicide, is guilty
of suicide. But the being who has taken Sallekhana does not have attachment,
etc., therefore he is not guilty of suicide. It is also said, "It is taught in
the scriptures that the non-arising of attachment, etc., is non-violence. And
the Jinas have declared their arising to be violence." Secondly, death is not
desirable for anyone. Just as a merchant engaged in giving, taking, and
accumulating various goods does not desire the destruction of his own house. And
if, due to circumstances, the causes of its destruction arise, he removes them
as much as possible. And if they cannot be removed, he strives so that the goods
are not destroyed. Similarly, a householder, engaged in the accumulation of the
goods of vows and conduct, does not desire the fall of his support. If, by
chance, the causes of their destruction arise, he strives to remove them so that
there is no hindrance to his virtues. And if they cannot be removed, 1. ti

## 282] Sarvarthasiddhi  [7123 $ 706] He avoids it by opposing his own
qualities, because the cause of its arising is present. And in the case of what
is difficult to avoid, he strives so that his own qualities are not destroyed.
How then can there be self-destruction?  8706. Here, the doubter says, "A Vrati
is free from blemishes," and there, the third blemish is false vision.
Therefore, a Vrati with right vision should be free from blemishes. Now, tell
us, is that right vision with blemishes or without blemishes? It is said: Due to
a particular state of delusion in someone, these blemishes arise: doubt, desire,
uncertainty, praise of another vision, and commendation of another vision. These
are the five transgressions of right vision. ||23||  8707. The absence of doubt,
etc., was explained in the sutra "Purity of vision." These doubts, etc., should
be known as their opposites. What is the difference between praise and
commendation? Praise is the mental arousal of the qualities of false vision and
misconduct, and commendation is the statement of the qualities that are or are
not present in false vision. This is the difference between the two. Now, right
vision is said to have eight limbs, so its transgressions should also be eight.
This is not a fault, because the Acharya will later speak of five transgressions
each for vows and conduct. Therefore, the other transgressions are included in
these two transgressions of praise and commendation, and only five
transgressions of right vision are mentioned.  8708. He says, "The
transgressions of right vision have been mentioned." Are there also
transgressions of vows and conduct in the same way? Yes, having said this, he
now speaks the following sutra to indicate the number of those transgressions:
There are five transgressions each for vows and conduct, in order. ||24||

## Chapter Seven  [283 8709. The term "vratashīla" is a compound word formed by
combining "vrat" and "shīla". In these vratashīlas, the inclusion of the term
"shīla" is not redundant. The inclusion of "shīla" is for the purpose of
explaining the specific meaning and for the protection of the vows. Therefore,
by including "shīla", terms like "digvirati" are included. § 710. In the context
of householders, the five transgressions of each of the vows and conduct should
be understood in the order they are mentioned. As follows: First, the
transgressions of the vow of non-violence are: Bondage, killing, mutilation,
excessive burdening, and deprivation of food and water. || 25 || 8711. Bondage
is the cause of preventing someone from going to their desired place. Striking
living beings with a stick, whip, or cane, etc. is killing. Here, killing does
not mean the separation of life, because the violence is abandoned before the
transgression. Mutilation is the cutting off of limbs like ears, nose, etc.
Excessive burdening is loading more than the appropriate weight. Depriving cows,
etc. of food and water by causing them hunger and thirst is deprivation of food
and water. These are the five transgressions of the vow of non-violence. False
advice, secret disclosure, forgery, misappropriation, and alteration of sacred
mantras are the five transgressions of the vow of truthfulness. || 26 || 8712.
False advice is to lead someone to a wrong path in actions that are the cause of
progress and liberation, or to deceive others with false words. Secret
disclosure is the revelation of a specific action performed in private by a man
and a woman. Forgery is when someone says that something was done by another
person, even though the other person did not say or do it, and it is done
because of the use of another person's words.

## Chapter Seven  [285]  **Action:**  To go to another man's house is called
*itvari*.  *Itvari* is a woman who is inclined to go to another man's house.
*Itvarika* is a woman who is extremely inclined to go to another man's house.
Here, the suffix 'ka' is added to *itvari* in a derogatory sense.  A woman who
has one husband is called *parigrihita*.  A woman who is a prostitute or an
adulteress and goes to other men's houses and has no husband is called
*apariagrihita*.  The going of a *parigrihita* *itvari* is called *itvarika
parigrihita gaman*, and the going of an *apariagrihita* *itvari* is called
*itvarika aparigrihita gaman*.  Here, the word *anga* means procreation and
womb.  And, playing outside of these is called *ananga krid*.  The increased
outcome of desire is called *kamativra abhinivesha*.  These are the five
transgressions of the *svadara santosha* anuvrata.  **Field, house, gold, gold,
wealth, grain, maidservant, servant, and fragrant substances:**  The
transgression of the measure of field and house, the transgression of the
measure of gold and gold, the transgression of the measure of wealth and grain,
the transgression of the measure of maidservant and servant, and the
transgression of the measure of fragrant substances are the five transgressions
of the *parigraha parimana* anuvrata. ||29||  $715$.  The land that produces
grain is called *kshetra*.  A house is called *vastu*.  *Hiranya* is the system
of transactions involving silver, etc.  *Suvarna* is understood.  Cows, etc. are
taken from *dhan*.  Rice, etc. are taken from *dhana*.  Servant women and men
together are called *dasidas*.  Silk, cotton, and *kosa* cloth, and sandalwood,
etc. are called *kupya*.  *Kshetra* and *vastu* are *kshetravastu*, *hiranya*
and *suvarna* are *hiranyasuvarna*, *dhan* and *dhana* are *dhanadhana*, *das*
and *das* are *dasidas*, and *kshetra*, *vastu*, *hiranyasuvarna*, *dhanadhana*,
*dasidas*, and *kupya* are *kshetravastuhiranyasuvarnadhanadhanadasidasakupya*.
Having decided that my possessions are only this much and no more, to increase
the measure of *kshetravastu*, etc. out of greed is called *pramanatikram*.
Thus, these are the five transgressions of the *parigraha parimana* anuvrata.
$716$.  The transgressions of the vows have been stated.  Now, the
transgressions of the conduct will be stated.  They are as follows:

||30|| 8717. **Atikram** is the transgression of the established limits of a
direction. It is of three types: **Urdhvaatikram**, **Adho'tikram** and
**Tiryagatikram**.  **Urdhvaatikram** occurs when one climbs a mountain or
similar elevation beyond the limit. **Adho'tikram** occurs when one descends
into a well or similar depth beyond the limit. **Tiryagatikram** occurs when one
enters a burrow or similar space beyond the limit. **Kshetravruddhi** is the
intention to expand the limit of a direction due to greed. This atikram can
occur due to carelessness, delusion or bias. **Smrityantaraadhan** is the
forgetting of the established limit. These are the five aticharas of Digvirati
Vrat.  **Aayan, Preshyaprayog, Shabdhanupaat, Rupaanupaat and Pudgalakshep are
the five aticharas of Deshaviriti Vrat.** ||31|| 8718. **Aayan** is the command
to bring something to a person residing in a place decided by oneself, for a
specific purpose. **Preshyaprayog** is the command to do something in a
particular way. **Shabdhanupaat** is the use of words like "cough" etc. to
address people engaged in a particular profession. **Rupaanupaat** is the
showing of one's body to those people. **Pudgalakshep** is the throwing of a
clod of earth or similar object. These are the five aticharas of Deshaviriti
Vrat.  ... **Kandarp, Kautkuchy, Moukhary, Asameekshyaadhikaran and
Upbhogparibhogaanarthakya are the five aticharas of Anarthadandhaviriti Vrat.**
||32|| 719. **Kandarp** is the use of indecent language mixed with humor due to
intense passion. **Kautkuchy** is the use of both humor and indecent language
along with physical misconduct towards others. **Moukhary** is the meaningless
talkativeness for the sake of being bold. **Asameekshyaadhikaran** is the
performance of an action beyond the limit without considering the purpose.
**Upbhogparibhogaanarthakya** is the use of something for a purpose other than
the one for which it was intended.

## Chapter Seven  **[287 Meaninglessness]**  These are the five transgressions
of the Anarthadanda-virati vow:  * **Yoga-dus-pranidhana:**  This refers to the
improper application of yoga, which can be of three types:     * **Kaya-dus-
pranidhana:** Improper application of the body.     * **Vachan-dus-pranidhana:**
Improper application of speech.     * **Mano-dus-pranidhana:** Improper
application of the mind. * **Anadar:** Lack of enthusiasm or respect. *
**Smriti-anupasthana:** Lack of mindfulness.  These are the five transgressions
of the Samayika vow:  * **A-pratyavekshita-a-pramajita-utsarga:**  This refers
to the disposal of waste without proper observation and purification. *
**A-pratyavekshita-a-pramajita-adana:** This refers to the taking of objects
without proper observation and purification. * **A-pratyavekshita-a-pramajita-
sanstara-upkramana:** This refers to the use of bedding without proper
observation and purification. * **Anadar:** Lack of enthusiasm or respect. *
**Smriti-anupasthana:** Lack of mindfulness.  These are the five transgressions
of the Proshdha-upavasa vow:  * **A-pratyavekshita-a-pramajita-utsarga:**  This
refers to the disposal of waste without proper observation and purification. *
**A-pratyavekshita-a-pramajita-adana:** This refers to the taking of objects
without proper observation and purification. * **A-pratyavekshita-a-pramajita-
sanstara-upkramana:** This refers to the use of bedding without proper
observation and purification. * **Anadar:** Lack of enthusiasm or respect. *
**Smriti-anupasthana:** Lack of mindfulness.  **Meaninglessness** is the act of
possessing more than what is necessary. This is a transgression of the
Anarthadanda-virati vow.  **[8720]** Three types of yoga have been explained.
Improper application of yoga is called **Yoga-dus-pranidhana**, which can be of
three types: **Kaya-dus-pranidhana**, **Vachan-dus-pranidhana**, and **Mano-dus-
pranidhana**. Lack of enthusiasm is called **Anadar**, and lack of mindfulness
is called **Smriti-anupasthana**. These are the five transgressions of the
Samayika vow.  **[8721]** To observe with the eyes whether a being exists or not
is called **pratyavekshana**. To use a soft instrument to achieve a purpose is
called **pramajita**. These two terms are connected to the next three terms:
**utsarga**, **adana**, and **upkramana**. For example, the disposal of waste on
the ground without proper observation and purification is called
**a-pratyavekshita-a-pramajita-utsarga**. Taking objects without proper
observation and purification is called **a-pratyavekshita-a-pramajita-adana**.
Using bedding without proper observation and purification is called
**a-pratyavekshita-a-pramajita-sanstara-upkramana**. Lack of enthusiasm in
performing necessary tasks due to hunger is called **Anadar**. The meaning of
**Smriti-anupasthana** has already been explained. These are the five
transgressions of the Proshdha-upavasa vow.

## Chapter Seven [289  **A special kind of attachment to memory is the cause of
happiness.** The mind is constantly given to that which is desired for
enjoyment, and this is the cause. These are the five transgressions of
Sallekhana.  8725. Here, in the description of the karma-asrava that is the
cause of becoming a Tirthankara, it was said, "by strength, by renunciation, by
austerity." Again, in the description of the vows, it was said, "the vow of
sharing with guests." The nature of this giving has not been known yet, so it is
explained here:  **Giving is the renunciation of one's own possessions for the
sake of benefit.** ||38||  8726. Benefit is the welfare of oneself and others.
The welfare of oneself is the accumulation of punya; the welfare of others is
the increase of right knowledge, etc. The word "own" refers to wealth. It should
be understood that giving is the renunciation of one's own possessions for the
sake of benefit.  8727. Here, it is said, "Giving has been described, but is its
fruit the same for all, or is there some difference?" To this, it is said:
**There is a difference in giving due to the difference in the method, the
object given, the giver, and the recipient.** ||39||  8728. The order of
accepting, etc., is the method. The difference arises from the qualities. This
word "difference" should be connected with each of the words "method," etc.
Thus, there is a difference in the method, a difference in the object given, a
difference in the giver, and a difference in the recipient. The difference in
the method is the difference in respect and disrespect in accepting, etc. The
difference in the object given is that which causes the increase of austerity,
study, etc. The difference in the giver is the absence of envy, sorrow, etc. The
difference in the recipient is being endowed with the qualities that are the
cause of liberation. Just as there is a difference in the earth, etc., and
therefore a difference in what is born from it...

## Chapter Eight  The nature of *āsrava* has been explained. Now, the nature of
*bandha*, which is the next topic, should be explained. While explaining
*bandha*, the causes of *bandha* are mentioned first, because *bandha* occurs
due to them.   **False belief, non-restraint, carelessness, passions, and karmic
activities are the causes of *bandha*.**  **Explanation:**  * **False belief**
etc. have already been explained. Where?      * **False belief** has been
explained in the aphorism "Faith in the true nature of things is right belief."
It is the opposite of right belief.      * **False belief** has also been
explained in the twenty-five actions while explaining *āsrava*.     * **Non-
restraint** has been explained. Its opposite, **restraint**, should be
understood.     * **Carelessness** is included in the actions of **violating the
injunctions** and **lack of desire**.      * **Carelessness** is the lack of
respect for good actions.     * **Passions** are anger, etc., which are of many
types due to their different effects, non-rejection, rejection, and agitation.
* These have also been explained earlier. Where?      * They have been explained
in the aphorism "Passions of the senses."     * **Karmic activities** are of
three types, based on body, speech, and mind.      * These have also been
explained earlier. Where?      * They have been explained in the aphorism
"Karmic activities of body, speech, and mind."  **False belief is of two types:
innate and acquired through instruction.**  * **Innate false belief** is the
lack of faith in the true nature of things, which arises due to the emergence of
the karma of false belief, without any instruction. * **Acquired false belief**
is of four types:      * **Action-based**,      * **Non-action-based**,      *
**Ignorant**, and      * **Deceptive**.  **Or, false belief is of five types:**
* **Absolute false belief**,  * **Opposite false belief**,  * **Doubtful false
belief**,  * **Mixed false belief**, and  * **Ignorant false belief**.

same, this is the exclusive attachment to Dharma and Dharmi. "This whole
universe is Purusha" or "Everything is eternal" or "Everything is non-eternal".
Considering the bound as unbound, the Kevali as a Kavalahari, and a woman as
Siddha, etc. are all examples of Viparyaya Mithyadarshana. Whether
Samyagdarshana, Samyagjnana, and Samyakcharitra together constitute the path to
liberation or not, not accepting any one side is Samshaya Mithyadarshana.
Considering all Devatas and all religions as equal is Vainayika Mithyadarshana.
Being devoid of the examination of what is beneficial and what is harmful is
Agnanika Mithyadarshana. It is said:  "There are 180 types of Kriyavadis, 84
types of Akriyavadis, 64 types of Agnanis, and 32 types of Vainayikas." 8732.
Avirati is of twelve types due to the non-compassion towards the six-bodied
beings and the difference in the objects of the six senses. Sixteen Kashayas and
nine Nokashayas, these are twenty-five Kashayas. Although there is a slight
difference between Kashayas and Nokashayas, it is not intended here, therefore,
all are called Kashayas. Four Manoyogas, four Vachanayogas, and five Kayayogas,
these are thirteen types of Yoga. In the Pramatta-Samyata Gunasthan, Aharaka-
Riddhihari Muni's Aharaka-Kayayoga and Aharaka-Mishra-Kayayoga are also
possible, thus Yoga becomes fifteen. Due to the difference in the subject matter
like Shuddhayashtak and Uttama-Kshama, etc., Pramada is of many types. Thus,
these five, Mithyadarshana, etc., together or separately, are the causes of
bondage. The explanation is as follows:  - Mithyadarshana, in the case of a
Jiva, all five together are the causes of bondage. - In the case of Sasadan-
Samyagdarshana, Samyag-Mithyadarshana, and Avirata-Samyagdarshana, Avirati,
etc., are four causes of bondage. - In the case of Samyata-Samyata, both Virati
and Avirati are mixed, and Pramada, Kashaya, and Yoga are the causes of bondage.
- In the case of Pramatta-Samyata, Pramada, Kashaya, and Yoga are the three
causes of bondage.  1. "This is eternal" etc. Mu, Di 1, Di 2, A. 2. Go. Karma,

## Chapter 8  **293** The four types of karmic poisons are: apramāda, etc. There
is only one type of yoga for the upaśānta-kaṣāya, kṣīṇa-kaṣāya, and sayoga-
kevali. There is no yoga for the ayoga-kevali.   **8733** The causes of bondage
have been stated. Now, bondage will be explained. Therefore, the sūtra says:
**2** Due to being with kaṣāya, the jīva takes in karmic particles that are
suitable for karma. This is bondage.  **8734** One who lives with kaṣāya is
called sakaṣāya. The state of being sakaṣāya is called sakaṣāyatva. Therefore,
due to being sakaṣāya. This is a statement of the cause. Just as one takes food
according to the digestive fire, similarly, one experiences states and
perceptions according to the intensity of the kaṣāya. The sūtra uses the word
"sakaṣāyatvāt" to reiterate the cause in order to explain this particular
characteristic.   The sūtra uses the word "jīva" to answer the question: "How
does the formless and handless soul take in karma?" The meaning of the word
"jīva" is derived from "jīvanāt jīvaḥ" - one who lives, i.e., one who sustains
life, one who has a lifespan, one who does not lack life.   The sūtra uses the
short phrase "karma-yogya" to convey the meaning. However, it uses the separate
case ending "karmaṇo yogya" to indicate another sentence. What is that other
sentence? "The jīva becomes sakaṣāya due to karma." This means that "karmaṇo" is
a statement of the cause, meaning that the jīva becomes sakaṣāya due to karma.
There is no coating of kaṣāya on a jīva without karma. This establishes the
eternal relationship between the jīva and karma. This also answers the question:
"How does the formless jīva become bound to the material karma?" Otherwise, if
bondage is considered to have a beginning, then the absence of bondage would be
implied for the Siddha, who possesses ultimate purity.   The second sentence is
"karmaṇo yogya puḍgalān ādatte." Due to the meaning, the case ending changes,
and the sixth case ending is used instead of the previous case ending that
indicated the cause. The word "puḍgal" is used to indicate the identity of
karma.

## 294] Sarvarthasiddhi  1813 8735 Thus, the inherent quality of the soul is
refuted, as it cannot be the cause of the cycle of existence. The word 'ādatte'
is used to explain the cause and the effect. Therefore, due to the attachment
arising from false perception, etc., the soul, which is permeated by all states
of existence, is bound by the subtle, single-field-perceiving, infinite and
innumerable particles, which are fit for karmic activity, without any division.
This is called bondage. Just as various kinds of seeds, flowers, and fruits,
when placed in a particular vessel, undergo a transformation into the form of
liquor, similarly, the particles residing in the soul, due to the influence of
yoga and kṣaya, undergo a transformation in the form of karma. The word 'saḥ' is
used to negate other possibilities. This is the bondage, there is no other.
Thus, the bondage of the quality and the qualified is refuted. The word 'bandha'
should be explained in terms of karma and other means. 8735. It is asked, is
this bondage one and the same, or are there different types of it? To this, it
is said:  There are four types: nature, state, experience, and region. ||3||
8736. Nature means inherent quality. What is the nature of neem? Bitterness.
What is the nature of jaggery? Sweetness. Similarly, what is the nature of the
knowledge-obscuring karma? Non-understanding of the object. What is the nature
of the perception-obscuring karma? Non-association with objects worthy of
perception. In this way, the sixth case ending is obtained. The word 'pudgala'
in the sūtra is used to show the identity of karma with the soul. This refutes
the idea that the soul has an inherent quality. Because, if it is considered to
be the inherent quality of the soul, it cannot be the cause of the cycle of
existence. The word 'ādatte' in the sūtra is used to explain the cause and the
effect. This means that due to the attachment arising from false perception,
etc., the soul, which is permeated by all states of existence, is bound by the
subtle, single-field-perceiving, infinite and innumerable particles, which are
fit for karmic activity, without any division. This is called bondage. Just as
various kinds of seeds, flowers, and fruits, when placed in a particular vessel,
undergo a transformation into the form of liquor, similarly, the particles
residing in the soul, due to the influence of yoga and kṣaya, undergo a
transformation in the form of karma. The word 'saḥ' in the sūtra is used to
negate other possibilities. This is the bondage, there is no other. Thus, the
bondage of the quality and the qualified is refuted. Here, the word 'bandha'
should be explained in terms of karma and other means.  **Special Meaning:**
This sūtra mainly explains bondage. Even though the soul substance has an
independent existence, it has been subject to karma since time immemorial, due
to which it has to wander through various realms like humans, hell beings, etc.
The question is, why is the soul subject to karma, and what is the nature of
that karma? This sūtra provides a comprehensive answer to both these questions.
The sūtra states that due to karma, the soul becomes afflicted with kṣaya, and
this leads to the attachment of particles fit for karmic activity. This is
bondage. This implies two things. Firstly, that karma causes impurity in the
soul, and this impurity leads to the bondage of karma. Secondly, that this
bondage between the soul and karma is eternal and immemorial. Thus, this sūtra
explains what bondage is and what causes it.  8735. To explain whether this
bondage is one or has different types, the next sūtra says:  There are four
types: nature, state, experience, and region. ||3||  8736. Nature means inherent
quality. What is the nature of neem? Bitterness. What is the nature of jaggery?
Sweetness. Similarly, what is the nature of the knowledge-obscuring karma? Non-
understanding of the object. What is the nature of the perception-obscuring
karma? Non-association with objects worthy of perception. In this way, the sixth
case ending is obtained.

knowledge") and other karmas do not deviate from their own nature of preventing
the knowledge of reality.   The **anubhava** (lit. "experience") is the specific
taste of these karmas. Just as the milk of goats, cows, and buffaloes has
different tastes, such as intense, mild, etc., so too the **karma pudgalas**
(lit. "particles of karma") have different experiences of their own inherent
qualities.   **Pradesha** (lit. "region") is the determination of the extent.
The **pradesha bandha** (lit. "region bondage") is the determination of the
**karma pudgala skandha** (lit. "aggregate of karma particles") in terms of
their atoms. The word "vidhi" means "type". These four, **prakriti** and the
others, are the types of **bandha** (lit. "bondage"). **Prakriti bandha** and
**pradesha bandha** are caused by **yoga** (lit. "effort"), while **sthiti
bandha** and **anubhava bandha** are caused by **kashaya** (lit. "passion").
The **bandha** is of various types depending on the intensity of **yoga** and
**kashaya**. As it is said:  "The living being binds **prakriti** and
**pradesha** through **yoga**, and **sthiti** and **anubhava** through
**kashaya**. There is no cause for the **bandha** of **sthiti** in those who are
not transformed by **yoga** and **kashaya**, and whose **yoga** and **kashaya**
have been destroyed."  **What is the prakriti of darshan avarana karma?** It is
the prevention of the illumination of the meaning. **What is the prakriti of the
experience of pleasure and pain?** It is the experience of the knowable, both
the real and the unreal. **What is the prakriti of darshan moha?** It is the
prevention of faith in the true meaning of reality. **What is the prakriti of
charitra moha?** It is the state of being uncontrolled. **What is the prakriti
of ayus karma?** It is the determination of the lifespan. **What is the prakriti
of nama karma?** It is the naming of a being, such as a hell-being. **What is
the prakriti of gotra karma?** It is the designation of a lineage as high or
low. **What is the prakriti of antaraya karma?** It is the creation of
obstacles, such as through giving.   This is the type of action that is
performed, that is, what causes it is its **prakriti**. Its **sthiti** is its
non-deviation from its own nature. Just as the sweetness of the milk of goats,
cows, and buffaloes does not deviate from its own nature, so too the **jnana
avarana** and other karmas do not deviate from their own nature of preventing
the knowledge of reality.   The **anubhava** is the specific taste of these
karmas. Just as the milk of goats, cows, and buffaloes has different tastes,
such as intense, mild, etc., so too the **karma pudgalas** have different
experiences of their own inherent qualities.   **Pradesha** is the determination
of the extent. The **pradesha bandha** is the determination of the **karma
pudgala skandha** in terms of their atoms. The word "vidhi" means "type". These
four, **prakriti** and the others, are the types of **bandha**. **Prakriti
bandha** and **pradesha bandha** are caused by **yoga**, while **sthiti bandha**
and **anubhava bandha** are caused by **kashaya**.   The **bandha** is of
various types depending on the intensity of **yoga** and **kashaya**. As it is
said:  "The living being binds **prakriti** and **pradesha** through **yoga**,
and **sthiti** and **anubhava** through **kashaya**. There is no cause for the
**bandha** of **sthiti** in those who are not transformed by **yoga** and
**kashaya**, and whose **yoga** and **kashaya** have been destroyed."  In
particular, this chapter describes the four types of **bandha**. Whatever karma
is bound by the **samprayayika asrava** (lit. "influx of karma from the past"),
we see it in these four forms. What is the nature of the bound karma, how long
does it last, how much does it function according to its own nature, and in what
form and to what extent does it bind the soul? These are the four types. The
main causes of the increase and decrease of these four types of karma are
**yoga** and **kashaya**. **Yoga** causes **prakriti bandha** and, to a greater
or lesser extent, **pradesha bandha**, while **kashaya** causes **sthiti
bandha** and, to a greater or lesser extent, **anubhava bandha**. 1, Mula. 31471

[296] Sarvarthasiddhi [814 8737$ 737. To show the difference of the first type
of karma-bandha, it is said: The first, namely, the karma-bandha of the nature,
is of eight types: jnana-avaran, darshan-avaran, vedaniya, mohaniya, ayu, nama,
gotra, and antaraya. ||4|| 8738. The first karma-bandha of the nature is to be
known as eight types: jnana-avaran, etc. That which covers or by which one is
covered is called avarna. It is connected with each, such as jnana-avaran and
darshan-avaran. That which causes vedana or by which one is vedana is called
vedaniya karma. That which deludes or by which one is deluded is called mohaniya
karma. That by which one goes to the hell, etc., is called ayu karma. That which
humbles the soul or by which the soul is humbled is called nama karma. That by
which the jiva is called high or low is called gotra karma. That which makes a
difference between the giver and the receiver, i.e., comes in between, is called
antaraya karma. Just as the food eaten once undergoes many transformations, such
as rasa, blood, etc., in the same way, the pudgalas taken in by one soul-
transformation undergo many transformations, such as jnana-avaran, etc. 1.

-816 § 742] Chapter Eight [297 8.739. It has been said that there are eight
types of *Mūla Prakriti Bandha*. Now, we will discuss *Uttara Prakriti Bandha*.
There are five, nine, two, twenty-eight, four, forty-two, two, and five types of
*Uttara Prakriti Bandha* respectively. ||5|| 8.740. Doubt: Should we consider
the second term here, which would imply that there are so many types of the
second *Uttara Prakriti Bandha*? Solution: We should not consider the second
term, because it is established by the principle of *Pāriśeṣya*. The eight types
of *Mūla Prakriti Bandha* have already been mentioned. Therefore, by the
principle of *Pāriśeṣya*, these are the types of *Uttara Prakriti Bandha*. The
word "types" is related to the numbers five, etc., in order. Thus, there are
five types of *Jñānāvaraṇa*, nine types of *Darśanāvaraṇa*, two types of
*Vedaniya*, twenty-eight types of *Mohaniya*, four types of *Āyu*, forty-two
types of *Nāma*, two types of *Gotra*, and five types of *Antarāya*. 8.741. If
*Jñānāvaraṇa* karma is of five types, then we should know about it. Therefore,
the next sūtra says: *Matijñāna*, *Śruta-jñāna*, *Avadhi-jñāna*, *Manaḥ-paryaya-
jñāna*, and *Kevala-jñāna* are the five *Jñānāvaraṇa* karmas that cover these
five types of knowledge. ||6|| 8.742. The types of knowledge like *mati*, etc.,
have been explained. There are different types of *āvaraṇa* that cover them,
therefore, we should know about the five *Uttara Prakriti* of *Jñānāvaraṇa*
karma. Doubt: Does an *abhavya* being have the power of *Manaḥ-paryaya-jñāna*
and *Kevala-jñāna*? If it does, then it would not be an *abhavya*. If it does
not, then the concept of these two *āvaraṇa* karmas would be pointless.
Solution: There is no fault because of the *ādeśa* (command) statement.
According to the *dravya-ārthika* (substance-oriented) *naya*, an *abhavya*
being has the power of *Manaḥ-paryaya-jñāna* and *Kevala-jñāna*, but according
to the *paryāya-ārthika* (attribute-oriented) *naya*, it does not have that
power. If this is the case, then the distinction between *bhavya* and *abhavya*
would not be valid, because both would have the power. However, the presence or
absence of power does not

## 298] Sarvarthasiddhi  [8178] The distinction between *bhavya* and *abhavya*
is based on the presence or absence of *vyakti*.  Why? Because of the presence
or absence of *vyakti* based on *samyagdarshana* and other things.  The one who
will have *vyakti* from *samyagdarshana* etc. is *bhavya*. The one who will not
have it is *abhavya*. This is like the difference between gold and non-gold
stones.  [8743] It has been said that there are five *uttaraprakriti*
distinctions of *jnanavarana* karma. Now, the *darshanavarana* karma needs to be
explained. Therefore, the next sutra says: "There are nine *darshanavarana*
karma: *chakshu*, *achakshu*, *avadhi*, and *kevala* (four types of
*darshanavarana*), and *nidra*, *nidranidra*, *prachala*, *prachala-prachala*,
and *styanagrudhi* (five types of *nidra* etc.)" ||7||  [8744] This explains the
distinction based on the *darshanavarana* of *chakshu*, *achakshu*, *avadhi*,
and *kevala*: *chakshudarshanavarana*, *achakshudarshanavarana*,
*avhidarshanavarana*, and *kevaladarshanavarana*.  *Mad*, *khed*, *klama*, and
*vinoda* are the causes of *swapa* (sleep).  *Nidra* is the absence of these.
**Doubt:** If this is the case, then how can there be a distinction between
*bhavya* and *abhavya* because both have the power of *manahparyaya* and
*kevalajnana*? **Solution:** The distinction between *bhavya* and *abhavya* is
not based on the presence or absence of the power of *manahparyaya* and
*kevalajnana*.  **Doubt:** Then on what basis is this distinction made?
**Solution:** This distinction is made based on the presence or absence of
*vyakti*.  The one who has *vyakti* from *samyagdarshana* etc., like gold and
other stones, is *bhavya*. The one who does not have it is *abhavya*.  **Special
Note:** Here, five *uttarabheda* of *jnanavarana* karma are mentioned.
Originally, there is only one *jnana*. These five distinctions are obtained due
to the characteristics of the *avarana*.  In the *Dhavala* commentary, the
example of the sun and the cloud is given to explain this.  It is explained that
just as even when the sun is covered by very dense clouds, some rays of the sun
still shine through the clouds, similarly, even when *kevalajnanavarana* karma
is covered, some knowledge still shines through.  This is what gives rise to the
four *uttaravarana* karma.  Thus, there are five *jnanavarana* karma in total,
which are found in both *bhavya* and *abhavya*.  In the scriptures, the terms
*bhavya* and *abhavya* are given based on the specific type of *bandha*.  These
distinctions of the *jiva* should be understood based on this.  There is no
other cause for these distinctions.  *Bandha* is of two types: one type of
*bandha* is *anadi* and *ananta* (beginningless and endless) in relation to the
offspring, and the other type is *anadi* and *santa* (beginningless and finite).
Those *jiva* who have *anadi-ananta* *bandha* of karma are called *abhavya*, and
those who have *anadi-santa* *bandha* are considered *bhavya*.  Therefore, even
though the power is the same for all *jiva*, there is a difference in its
manifestation.  In the scriptures, the example of gold and blind stones is given
to explain this distinction.  This example also supports the above statement.
Thus, it has been explained why there are five distinctions of *jnanavarana*
karma.  [8743] The *uttaraprakriti* distinctions of *jnanavarana* karma have
been explained. Now, the *darshanavarana* karma needs to be explained.
Therefore, the next sutra says: "There are nine *darshanavarana* karma:
*chakshu*, *achakshu*, *avadhi*, and *kevala* (four types of *darshanavarana*),
and *nidra*, *nidranidra*, *prachala*, *prachala-prachala*, and *styanagrudhi*
(five types of *nidra* etc.)" ||7||  [8744] This explains the distinction based
on the *darshanavarana* of *chakshu*, *achakshu*, *avadhi*, and *kevala*:
*chakshudarshanavarana*, *achakshudarshanavarana*, *avhidarshanavarana*, and
*kevaladarshanavarana*.  *Mad*, *khed*, *klama*, and *vinoda* are the causes of
*swapa* (sleep).  *Nidra* is the absence of these.

## Chapter Eight  [299]  **Nidra-nidra** is the continuous flow of **vritti**
(mental activity). **Prachala** is the action that moves the soul, caused by
sorrow, fatigue, intoxication, etc., and is indicated by the movement of the
eyes and limbs even in a seated being. **Prachala-prachala** is the repeated
occurrence of **prachala**. **Styanagridhi** is the special type of **virya**
(energy) that manifests in dreams.  Since the verb "**styayate**" has multiple
meanings, the meaning of "dream" is taken here. **Gridhi** means "shining." The
meaning of **Styanagridhi** is derived from the root "**styane**" (to be dull)
and "**gaddhayati**" (to shine) in dreams.  It means that the soul performs many
violent actions due to the rise of **Styanagridhi**. Here, the term
**darshanavaran** (veil of perception) is connected with **nidra** (sleep) and
other terms through **samanaadhikarannya** (common ground). For example,
**nidra-darshanavaran**, **nidra-nidra-darshanavaran**, etc.  8745. To explain
the **uttaraprakriti** (subsequent nature) of the third **prakriti** (nature),
it is said: **Sadvedya** and **Asavedya** are the two **vedaniya** (objects of
experience). || 8 ||  8746. **Sadvedya** is that which, upon its rise, leads to
the attainment of physical and mental happiness in the paths of gods, etc.
**Sadvedya** is the name for a good object of experience. **Asavedya** is that
which results in various kinds of suffering. **Asavedya** is the name for a bad
object of experience.  **Special Note:** Here, two types of **vedaniya** karma
(karma that produces experience) are mentioned. This is **jiva-vipaki** karma
(karma that ripens in the soul). The **sat** (good) and **asat** (bad) states of
the soul are caused by its rise. The external material objects are called its
fruits, but this is a metaphorical statement. In reality, external material
objects are the cause of the rise of **sat** and **asat**. Therefore, the
attainment of external material objects can be considered the fruit of
**vedaniya** karma metaphorically. The cause of the attainment of external
material objects in the paths of gods, hell, and the realms of enjoyment is the
**leshya** (subtle karmic impressions) of those respective paths. In the realm
of karma, there are many causes for the attainment of external material objects.
Thus, one should understand the two types of **vedaniya** karma and their
functions.

Darshanamohaniya is of three types, Charitramohaniya is of two types, Akashaya
Vedaniya is of nine types, and Kashaya Vedaniya is of sixteen types. 8749. Of
these, the three divisions of Darshanamohaniya are Samyaktvam, Mithyatvam, and
Tadubhayam. It is one in terms of bondage, but three in terms of good deeds. Of
these three, the one whose rise makes the being turn away from the path ordained
by the omniscient, who is not eager to have faith in the true meaning, who is
incapable of considering what is beneficial and harmful, and who is thus a
Mithyadristi, is Mithyatvam Darshanamohaniya. The same Mithyatvam, when it stops
its own sap (vipak) due to the cause of auspicious results, and remains
indifferent, not stopping the faith of the soul, is Samyaktvam. The person who
experiences this is called a Samyagdristi. The same Mithyatvam, due to a special
cleansing, becomes half-pure in sap, like a Kodra with diminished strength, and
is called Tadubhayam. Its other name is Samyamithyatvam. Its rise results in a
dualistic result, like the mixed result obtained from the use of Kodra and rice
by one with diminished strength. 8747. Now, to show the alternatives of the

## Chapter Eight  **8750.  **There are two types of *charitramohaniya* (karma
that hinders right conduct): *akashaya* (non-poisonous) and *kashaya*
(poisonous).  The term *akashaya* is used here for *ishadkashaya* (slightly
poisonous) because the word *na* (not) is used in the sense of *ishada*
(slightly). There are nine types of *akashaya* *vedaniya* (karma that produces
non-poisonous experiences), due to the difference in their nature, such as
*hasya* (laughter).   * *Hasya* is that which arises from laughter. * *Rati* is
that which arises from desire for things like country, etc. * *Arati* is the
opposite of *rati*. * *Shoka* is that which arises from sorrow. * *Bhaya* is
that which arises from fear. * *Jugupsa* is that which arises from the
suppression of one's own faults and the exposure of others' faults. * *Striveda*
is that which arises from the acceptance of feminine qualities. * *Puveda* is
that which arises from the acceptance of masculine qualities. * *Napusakaved* is
that which arises from the acceptance of neuter qualities.  **8751.** There are
sixteen types of *kashaya* *vedaniya* (karma that produces poisonous
experiences), due to the difference in their nature, such as *anantaanubandhi*
(infinitely connected). These *kashayas* are: *krodha* (anger), *mana* (pride),
*maya* (deceit), and *lobha* (greed). They have four stages: *anantaanubandhi*,
*apratyakhyanavarna*, *pratyakhyanavarna*, and *sanjwalana*.  * *Ananta*
(infinite) *samsara* (cycle of birth and death) is caused by *mithyadarshana*
(false belief), which is therefore called *ananta*. The *kashayas* that are
connected to this *ananta* are called *anantaanubandhi* *krodha*, *mana*,
*maya*, and *lobha*. * *Apratyakhyanavarna* *krodha*, *mana*, *maya*, and
*lobha* are those that cover the rejection of *desh* (territory) and prevent the
individual from even slightly performing *virati* (restraint) and *samyama*
(control), which are also known as *samyama-asamyama*. * *Pratyakhyanavarna*
*krodha*, *mana*, *maya*, and *lobha* are those that cover the complete
rejection of *samyama* and prevent the individual from performing complete
*virati*. * *Sanjwalana* *krodha*, *mana*, *maya*, and *lobha* are those that
burn brightly together with *samyama* or cause *samyama* to burn brightly in
their presence.  These sixteen *kashayas* are collectively called *kashaya*
*vedaniya*.  **Note:** *Charitramohaniya* karma has two types:
*darshanamohaniya* and *charitramohaniya*. *Darshanamohaniya* karma hinders the
attainment of right belief, while *charitramohaniya* karma hinders the
attainment of right conduct.

## 302] There are three main types of **mohaniya** (that which obscures).
**Mithyatva** (false belief) is the opposite of **samyag darshan** (right
belief). The living being has been holding **mithyatva** since beginningless
time. It is only when it receives the appropriate **dravya** (substance) and
other causes that it develops **samyag darshan**. This **samyag darshan** first
arises only after the **mithyatva** karma (action) that is its opposite is
subdued. Generally, this happens when the time remaining for the living being to
stay in the world is equal to the time it takes for half a **pudgala** (atom) to
change. It does not happen before that. There is no rule that it must happen
when that much time remains. It can happen even when less time remains. This is
called **prathamopaśama samyag darshan** (the first subduing of right belief).
**Samyag darshan** means right belief. According to Jainism, the belief that
upholds the principle of individual freedom and leads to self-realization is
considered right belief. When this **samyag darshan** arises, the karma that is
its opposite is divided into three parts. These are called **mithyatva**,
**samyag mithyatva**, and **samyak prakriti mithyatva**. The first one continues
to do its own work. The second and third work according to their names. That is,
**samyag mithyatva** is the cause for the mixed result, and **samyak prakriti
mithyatva** is the cause for the right belief result to be flawed. In this way,
one **mithyatva** karma, having received the cause for right belief, is divided
into three parts. Therefore, in relation to bondage, it is considered to be one,
but in relation to existence, it is considered to be of three types.  The second
type of **mohaniya** is **charitra mohaniya** (that which obscures conduct). We
have already explained that the belief that upholds the principle of individual
freedom is **samyag darshan**. Therefore, the conduct that is in accordance with
this belief can be considered **sadachar** (good conduct), and nothing else.
This is why, according to Jainism, conduct that is in accordance with self-
reliance is called **sadachar**. The other name for this **sadachar** is
**sacharitra** (true conduct). The karma that hinders the attainment of this
**sacharitra** is called **charitra mohaniya** in the scriptures. It has two
main types: **kṣayavedaniya** (that which causes destruction) and
**akṣayavedaniya** (that which does not cause destruction). **Akṣayavedaniya**
does not hinder the attainment of **samyak charitra** (right conduct) because it
is **deshghati karma** (karma that destroys the body). **Kṣayavedaniya** has
four types. Among them, **ananta anubandhi** (infinitely connected) **krodha**
(anger), **mana** (pride), **maya** (deceit), and **lobha** (greed) do not allow
the principle of self-reliance, which is in accordance with individual freedom,
to be established in life. This is why they are called **ananta** (infinite),
meaning the cause of the cycle of birth and death. There is an inseparable
connection between individual freedom and self-reliance. When there is faith in
individual freedom in life, the importance of self-reliance is automatically
understood. It is not possible for someone to have faith in individual freedom
in their life but still be inclined towards making their life dependent on
others. This is why the **ananta anubandhi** quartet is considered to be the
cause of the infinite cycle of birth and death.  In this way, when there is a
desire for individual freedom and self-reliance in accordance with it in life,
the individual strives to become completely self-reliant. However, they cannot
abandon all their past dependencies at once. Therefore, as they become
internally purified, they become more and more self-reliant. Sometimes, it also
happens that even when there is complete faith in individual freedom and the
path of self-reliance in a person's life, they find themselves unable to put it
into practice. This is considered to be due to inner weakness in life, and
**apratyakhyanavaran** (unrejected covering) **krodha**, **mana**, **maya**, and
**lobha** are the causes for maintaining this state. This is why these
**kṣayās** (passions) are called the hinderers of partial self-reliance. And
**pratyakhyanavaran** **krodha**, **mana**, **maya**, and **lobha** are
considered to be the hinderers of complete self-reliance. **Sanjvalan**
(burning) **krodha**, **mana**, **maya**, and **lobha** do make the practice of
self-reliance flawed, but they are not able to hinder it. In this way, we have
briefly considered the function of **mohaniya** and its sub-types.

## Chapter Eight  **752.**  The author, after explaining the **Mohaniya** karma,
now explains the **Ayush** karma, which determines the nature of the future
birth, by saying:  **Narka-ayush, Tiryancha-ayush, Manusha-ayush, and Deva-ayush
are the four types of Ayush.** ||10||  **753.** The **Ayush** karma is named
according to the type of birth it leads to. For example, the **Narka-ayush**
leads to birth in hell, **Tiryancha-ayush** leads to birth in the animal realm,
**Manusha-ayush** leads to birth as a human, and **Deva-ayush** leads to birth
in the heavenly realms. In hell, where there is intense cold and heat, the
**Narka-ayush** is responsible for a long life. Similarly, the other types of
**Ayush** are responsible for the duration of life in their respective realms.
**754.**  Having explained the four types of **Ayush**, the author now explains
the **Nama-karma**, which determines the nature of the future birth, by saying:
**Gati, Jati, Sharira, Ango-upanga, Nirman, Bandhan, Sanghata, Sansthan,
Sanhanan, Sparsha, Rasa, Gandha, Varna, Anupurvya, Aguru-laghu, Upghāt, Parghāt,
Ātap, Udyot, Ucchvās, Viha-yoga-gati, and the corresponding opposite qualities,
namely, ordinary body and each body, stationary and mobile, unfortunate and
fortunate, bad voice and good voice, inauspicious and auspicious, coarse and
subtle, insufficient and sufficient, unstable and stable, unworthy and worthy,
bad fame and good fame, and Tirthankara-hood, are the forty-two types of Nama-
karma.** ||11||  **8755.** The **Gati** is the karma that determines the realm
of birth. There are four types of **Gati**: **Narka-gati** (hell), **Tiryancha-
gati** (animal realm), **Manusha-gati** (human realm), and **Deva-gati**
(heavenly realms). The **Narka-gati** karma is responsible for the birth of a
soul in hell. Similarly, the other types of **Gati** karma are responsible for
the birth of a soul in their respective realms.

[306] Sarvarthasiddhi [81118755] That which is the cause of the body of a
stationary being is called *sthāvara* karma. That which is the cause of
happiness from its arising is called *subhaga* karma. That which is the cause of
unhappiness even though it is associated with qualities like form, etc., from
its arising is called *durbhaga* karma. That which is the cause of the
production of a pleasing voice is called *susvara* karma. The opposite of this
is *duhsvara* karma. That which is the cause of being pleasing from its arising
is called *subha* karma. The opposite of this is *asubha* karma. That which is
the cause of a subtle body is called *sukshma* karma. That which is the cause of
a body that is a hindrance to others is called *bādhara* karma. That which is
the cause of the fulfillment of needs like food, etc., from its arising is
called *paryāpti* karma. It is of six types: *āhāra-paryāpti* karma, *śarīra-
paryāpti* karma, *indriya-paryāpti* karma, *prāṇāpāna-paryāpti* karma, *bhāṣā-
paryāpti* karma, and *manaḥ-paryāpti* karma. That which is the cause of the
absence of these six types of fulfillments is called *aparyāpti* karma. That
which is the cause of stability is called *sthira* karma. The opposite of this
is *asthira* karma. That which is the cause of a body that is endowed with
radiance is called *ādeya* karma. That which is the cause of a body that is
devoid of radiance is called *anādeya* karma. That which is the cause of the
propagation of virtuous qualities is called *yaśaḥ-kīrti* karma. The opposite of
this is *ayaśaḥ-kīrti* karma. That which is the cause of becoming an Arhant is
called *tīrthakara* karma.   **Special Note:** Here, the functions of the *nāma*
karmas in their subsequent states are discussed. There are eight *mūla* karmas.
Out of these, seven are considered *jīva-vipāki*. *Nāma* karma is both *jīva-
vipāki* and *pudgala-vipāki*. Those karmas whose result is in the *jīva* are
*jīva-vipāki*, and those whose result is in the *pudgala* like the body, etc.,
are *pudgala-vipāki*. This is their literal meaning. Keeping this in mind, it is
necessary to discuss their meaning in detail. Generally, all karmas bind by
becoming the cause of the *jīva's* delusion, attachment, aversion, etc.,
therefore their result is in the *jīva* itself. That is, the *jīva* acquires the
respective abilities from the arising of these karmas. Still, what is the reason
for making distinctions like *jīva-vipāki*, *pudgala-vipāki*, *kṣetra-vipāki*,
and *bhava-vipāki*? This is what we need to see here. The *jīva's* samsara is
due to the union of the *jīva* and *pudgala*. While residing there, he takes
birth in various *gatis*, dies, and assumes various bodies according to them.
This cannot happen without a cause, therefore various types of karmas are
considered to be the cause of their attainment. Those which are called *bhava-
vipāki* in the scriptures are called by that name because they are caused by a
particular state in that particular *paryāya*. Those which are called *kṣetra-
vipāki* maintain the *jīva's* form during the interval when he is going from one
*gati* to another. Those which are called *pudgala-vipāki* are helpful in the
attainment of various types of bodies and sense organs capable of enjoyment, and
those which are called *jīva-vipāki* help in the *jīva's* various types of
*pariṇāmas* and his various states.

[8113 § 758 **308]** **Sarvarthasiddhi** $ 758. To indicate the Uttaraprakriti
of the eighth Karma-prakriti, it is said: **Danalābhabhogopabhoga vīryāṇām
||13||** 8759. Here, the distinction is made in relation to Antarayas: Antaray
of Dana, Antaray of Labha, etc. This designation is given because they are the
cause of obstruction to the results of Dana, etc. One who desires to give, but
does not give; one who desires to obtain, but does not obtain; one who desires
to enjoy, but cannot enjoy; one who desires to consume, but cannot consume; and
one who desires to be enthusiastic, but cannot be enthusiastic – these are the
five types of Antarayas. **Special Meaning:** These five are the attainments of
a Jiva: Dana, Labha, Bhoga, Upabhoga, and Virya. The Antarayakarma is the
obstructive cause in the manifestation of these five Jiva-states. This is the
meaning of the above statement. Sometimes, the fruit of the destruction and
pacification of Antarayakarma is said to be the attainment of external material
things, but that is a remedial statement. In reality, it is about external
material things. To say that their attainment is the fruit of the destruction
and pacification of the Jiva-vipaki Antarayakarma is a remedial statement. One
should understand here that the feeling of "mine" in others is the fruit of
Mithyatva, and its acceptance is the fruit of Kashaya. 8760. The types of
Prakriti-bandha have been stated. Now, the types of Sthiti-bandha should be
stated. That Sthiti is of two types: Utkrishta Sthiti and Jaghanya Sthiti. To
indicate those Karma-prakritis whose Utkrishta Sthiti is the same, it is said:

## Chapter Eight: The Supreme State of the Three Avaranas and Antarayakarma is
Thirty Koti Koti Sagaropama  **14.** The term "Aditah" is used in the sutra to
indicate that the three Avaranas should not be taken at the beginning, middle,
or end. The term "Antarayasya" refers to the Antarayakarma, which is distinct
from the three Avaranas. The quantity "Sagaropama" has been previously
explained. Koti Koti means Koti of Kotis. The word "Para" signifies supreme.
This means that the supreme state of the three Avaranas (Jnana Avarana, Darsana
Avarana, and Vedaniya) and Antarayakarma is thirty Koti Koti Sagaropama. This
supreme state is attained by a Mithyadristi, Sanjni, Panchendriya, and Paryapta
Jiva. For other Jivas, it should be understood according to their respective
Agamas.  **15.** The supreme state of Mohaniya is seventy Koti Koti Sagaropama.
**16.** The supreme state of Nama and Gotra is twenty Koti Koti Sagaropama.

## Chapter Eight: The Innermost Moment of the Remaining Karmas  **8772.** The
innermost moment of the remaining five karmas is as follows: The innermost
moment of knowledge-obscuring karma is in the subtle-pervasive state (sūkṣma-
sāmprāya) of the guṇasthāna; the innermost moment of perception-obscuring karma
is in the non-cessation-pervasive state (anivṛtti-bādarasa-sāmprāya) of the
guṇasthāna; and the innermost moment of the karma of lifespan is in the lifespan
of animals and humans that is measured in years.  **8773.** Both types of states
have been described. Now, the question arises: What is the nature of the
experience of knowledge-obscuring karma and the other karmas?  **8774.** The
experience is called **vipaka**, which means the ripening of the karma. This
ripening can be specific or diverse. It is specific due to the difference in the
intensity of the passions (kaṣāya) and the flow of the karmic matter (āsrava) as
described earlier. Or, it can be diverse due to the difference in the nature of
the substance (dravya), the field (kṣetra), the time (kāla), the state of being
(bhava), and the cause (nimitta) that give rise to the various forms of
ripening. This ripening is called **anubhava**. The experience of the auspicious
karmas is excellent due to the predominance of auspicious results, and the
experience of the inauspicious karmas is inferior. Similarly, the experience of
the inauspicious karmas is excellent due to the predominance of inauspicious
results, and the experience of the auspicious karmas is inferior. This
experience, obtained through the influence of the karmas, manifests in two ways:
through one's own mouth (svamukha) and through the mouth of another (paramukha).
All the root karmas experience only through one's own mouth. The subsequent
karmas, which are of the same type, experience through the mouth of another as
well, except for the karmas of lifespan, perception-obscuring karma, and
conduct-obscuring karma. For example, the karma of hellish lifespan does not
ripen through the mouth of the lifespan of animals or humans. Similarly,
perception-obscuring karma does not ripen through the mouth of conduct-obscuring
karma, and vice versa.  **8775.** **Doubt:** The experience is the ripening of
the various types of karmas accumulated in the past. But we do not understand...

3121 Sarvarthasiddhi [8122 8776 Is this *praसंख्यात* or *apraसंख्यात*? It is
said that it is *praसंख्यात* because it is experienced. Why? Because it is like
its name. ||220 8776. The result of *jnanaavaran* is the absence of knowledge,
and the result of *darshanavaran* is the obstruction of the power of perception.
Thus, from the indication of the meaningful names of all the *karma* natures,
with their sub-categories, the knowledge of their experience arises. 8777. It is
said, if the result is accepted as experience, then does the experienced *karma*
remain like an ornament, or does it fall away like the essence that has been
drunk? To this, it is said, Therefore, there is *nirjara*. ||23|| 8778. Just as
the waste of rice etc. is eliminated and becomes *nirjina*, similarly, by giving
good and bad results to the soul, the destruction of the previously attained
state, due to the absence of that state, is the *nirjara* of *karma*. It is of
two types: *vipakaja* and *avipakaja*. In that, for the being who has wandered
for a long time in the great ocean of *samsara*, consisting of four *gatis* and
many types of *jati*, when the time for the ripening of good and bad *karma*
arrives, and the stream of the *anubhavodayavali* enters, the cessation of the
*karma* after giving its result is *vipakaja nirjara*. The *karma* whose time
for ripening has not yet arrived, but which is experienced by being forcibly
brought into the *anubhavodayavali* by the power of a particular *aupakramika
kriya*, like the ripening of mangoes and jackfruit, is *avipakaja nirjara*. The
word 'c' indicates the collection of other causes. 'By *tapas* there is also
*nirjara*'. This will be said later, therefore, the purpose of giving the word
'c' is that *nirjara* occurs in the way mentioned earlier, and also in other
ways.  Doubt: Here, the mention of *nirjara* is in 1. *nasya phalam mu*. 2.
*bhutam kima -mu*. 3. *ganite a*, *di. 1*, *di. 2*. Jain Education International

## Chapter Eight  [313c] It will be said that the meaning of the sutra is
applied here, as it is said "other than that". Why is the mention of "nirjara"
made here? Shouldn't it be mentioned after "samvara", as per the purpose?
**Solution:** The mention of "nirjara" is made here for brevity. If the text
were to be given after "samvara", then "vipako'nubhavaḥ" would have to be
translated again.  "Anubhava", "anubhaga", and "phaladanashakti" all have the
same meaning. At the time of the binding of karma, the karma acquires a
"phaladanashakti" (fruit-giving power) according to its nature. For example,
"jnanavaran" has the nature of covering knowledge, therefore it acquires a
"phaladanashakti" accordingly. The meaning of "prakriti" is nature, and the
meaning of "anubhava" is to experience according to that nature.   Generally, it
can be said here that if this is the meaning of "prakriti" and "anubhava", then
it is not appropriate to consider them separately, because it is naturally
proven that the experience will be according to the nature of the karma.
Therefore, "prakritibandha" and "anubhavabandha" are not two independent
entities, but "anubhavabandha" is included in "prakritibandha".  If it is said
that the nature of karma, in the form of "jnanavaran" etc., is due to the
"phaladanashakti", therefore "anubhavabandha" cannot be included in
"prakritibandha", then the solution is this: While the cause of "prakritibandha"
is "yoga", and the cause of "anubhavabandha" is "hinaadhikta"
(inferiority/superiority) due to "kashaya", then how can it be considered that
the nature of karma is formed due to "phaladanashakti"? Even if we assume this
for a while, the question still remains: Why are "prakritibandha" and
"anubhavabandha" considered separately, and why are "yoga" and "kashaya" given
as two independent causes for their separate consideration?  The sutrakar has
described four types of binding, and has also called "vipak" (karma experience)
as "anubhava", and has described it according to its nature. This proves that
they are not actually two, but what is called "prakriti" at the time of binding,
is called "anubhava" at the time of its manifestation?  **Solution:** At the
time of karma binding, the division of karma in various forms is due to "yoga",
and the acquisition of "hinaadhik" (inferior/superior) "phaladanashakti" in the
acquired karma is due to "kashaya", therefore these two are considered
independent.  Although it is true that without power, the nature of any karma
cannot be formed. By saying "independent prakriti", the knowledge of its power
is already implied. However, there is a limit to such power. The knowledge of
the power that is acquired beyond that limit is the work of "anubhagabandha".
For example, in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth "gunasthanas", there is
"prakritibandha" of "satavedaniya", and this "prakritibandha" is for a fixed
limit of "anubhaga". However, "anubhagabandha" is prohibited here. The reason
for this is that the "anubhaga" that was acquired in the "sakashay" state of
"satavedaniya" is not acquired here. The "anubhaga" acquired in the "sakashay"
state is also only a fraction of infinity. Such a small "anubhaga" cannot be
acquired in the "sakashay" state. This proves the usefulness of calling
"anubhagabandha" separately from "prakritibandha".  The implication is that in
"prakritibandha", although the difference in karma is accepted, "hinaadhik"
(inferior/superior) "phaladanashakti" is not accepted. However, in
"anubhagabandha", this and its cause are considered independently. Therefore,
"prakritibandha" and its cause are independent, and "anubhagabandha" and...

[314] Sarvarthasiddhi [8123 6 7798779. It has been stated that the bond of
experience (anubhavabandh) is independent. Now, the bond of region
(pradeshabhandh) is to be discussed. In discussing it, the following points need
to be clarified: what are the causes, when does it occur, what is the
instrument, what is its nature, in what does it occur, and what is its extent?
To address these questions, the following sutra is presented in a sequential
manner, keeping in mind the distinction between the questions raised. The cause
is independent, this is certain. Now, regarding the sutrakar's statement about
the experience of the result (vipak), the same meaning is implied in this
statement. The result of all beings is not of the same kind, it is seen to be
more or less, and this variation in the result cannot be without a cause. This
is why the sutrakar independently considers the bond of experience and
substantiates it through the result. Thus, we have considered what the bond of
experience is and why it is called independent. However, this section of the
bond, as it is obtained in the time of bondage (bandhkal), does not remain
exactly the same. Within its own time of existence, it changes and also does not
change. Due to change, there are three stages: transition (sankraman), elevation
(utkarshan), and degradation (apkarshan). Transition occurs in the sub-natures
(avantaraprakriti), not in the original natures (moolaprakriti). Even in that,
the transition of the life-karma (ayukarma) does not occur in the sub-natures,
and the transition of the knowledge-delusion (darshanamohaniya) does not occur
in the form of conduct-delusion (charitramohaniya), and the transition of the
conduct-delusion does not occur in the form of knowledge-delusion. There are
four types of transition: nature-transition (prakritisankraman), state-
transition (sthitisankraman), section-transition (anubhagasankraman), and
region-transition (pradeshasankraman). Where nature-transition and region-
transition are predominant, it is addressed by the word transition, and where
only state-transition and section-transition occur, it is addressed by the words
elevation and degradation. The decrease in the state and section obtained in the
time of bondage is degradation, and the increase in the decreased state and
section is elevation. Thus, passing through various stages, the section that
remains in the time of emergence (udayakal) undergoes maturation (paripāk). The
maturation of the natures obtained in the non-emergent state (anudayavastā)
occurs in the form of the same kind of nature obtained in the emergent state
(udayavastā). The rule in this regard is that the fruit of the emergent natures
is obtained directly (svamukhase), and the fruit of the non-emergent natures is
obtained indirectly (paramukhase). For example, if the seven-fold (sata) is
emergent, its enjoyment is also in the form of the seven-fold, but then the non-
seven-fold (asata) continues to transform into the seven-fold through the
transition of the state-section (stibuksankraman), therefore its emergence is
indirect. The transformation of the non-emergent nature into the form of the
nature obtained in the emergent state, before the time of emergence, is the
state-section transition. All the natures that are not emergent in a particular
time, but exist in the form of being (satta), continue to transform in this way
at all times. The section is of two types, based on the distinction between
harmful (ghāti) and non-harmful (aghāti). The section of the four types of
harmful natures is vine (lata), wood (daru), bone (asthi), and rock (shail). The
two types of non-harmful natures are merit (punya) and demerit (pap). The
section of the merit natures is divided into four parts: jaggery (gud), sugar
(khanḍ), sugar candy (sharkara), and nectar (amrita). The four types of sections
of the demerit natures are neem (nimba), sour fruit (kanjira), poison (vish),
and poison (halaahal). Thus, the bond of section has been considered in general.
8779. The bond of experience has been stated! Now, the bond of region is to be
stated. While stating it, these points are worth mentioning: what is the cause
of the bond of region, when does it occur, what is its instrument, what is its
nature, in what does it occur, and what is its extent? Thus, keeping these
questions in mind, the next sutra is stated in a sequential manner.

## Chapter Eight  [315] The name-affections (karma) are subtle, confined to a
single field, and abiding, being infinite in number, and they are found in all
the regions of the soul. ||24|| 8780. The name-affections are called "name"
because they are all the karmic substances, as is stated in the sutra "as they
are named." This explains the cause. "Found in all" means that they are found in
all the states of existence. The word "sarvatah" (found in all) is derived from
the sutra "they are seen from other places also." This explains the time. For
each individual soul, there are infinite past lives, and there are countless,
innumerable, and infinite future lives. The word "yogaviseshat" (specific yoga)
indicates that the karmic particles are acquired due to specific karmic
conditions. The words "subtle" etc. are used to indicate the nature of the
karmic particles that are capable of being acquired. The karmic particles that
are capable of being acquired are subtle, not gross. The word "ekaksetravagaha"
(confined to a single field) indicates that they are not found in other fields.
The word "sthita" (abiding) indicates that they are not moving, but are
stationary. The words "sarvatma-pradesesu" (in all the regions of the soul)
indicate the basis. The karmic regions are not found in a single region or in a
few regions. Where then are they found? They are found pervading all the regions
of the soul, above, below, and sideways. The words "anantaanant-pradesha"
(infinite in number) indicate that they are not countable, nor innumerable, nor
infinite. These karmic aggregates are infinite times greater than the non-
existent, and they are of the size of an infinite part of the liberated soul.
They are confined to a field of an innumerable part of a ghana-angula (a measure
of length), and they are abiding for a time that is countable, innumerable, and
infinite. They are of five colors, five tastes, two smells, and four touches,
and they are capable of being acquired by the eight types of karmic substances.
They are acquired by the soul through the specific yoga. Thus, the karmic
bondage should be understood in brief. 1.  Past lives are infinite, countless,
and innumerable. 2.  Future lives are countless, innumerable, and infinite. 3.
They are acquired by the soul through the specific yoga.

## 316] Sarvarthasiddhi  [8125 83818781. It is said; the enumeration of the
objects of bondage, namely, merit and demerit, has been stated, and it has been
declared that they are included in bondage. In this connection, it is to be
stated what is the bondage of merit and what is the bondage of demerit. In this
regard, this sutra is begun for the enumeration of the nature of merit:
**Sadvaidyashubhayurnamagotrasani punyam ||25||** 8782.  "Shubha" means
auspicious. This is connected with each of the subsequent terms, such as
auspicious life, auspicious name, and auspicious lineage. Auspicious life is of
three kinds: the life of a lower animal, the life of a human, and the life of a
god. There are thirty-seven varieties of auspicious name. For example, the state
of being a human, the state of being a god, the five-sense beings, the five
bodies, the three limbs and appendages, the square-shaped form, the strong
structure of a diamond, a bull, and a spear, auspicious color, auspicious taste,
auspicious smell, and auspicious touch, the sequence of human states and the
sequence of god states, these two, the heavier and the lighter, the striking,
the exhaling, the heat, the radiance, the auspicious state of non-attachment,
fear, haste, fulfillment, each body, stability, auspiciousness, prosperity, good
voice, receiving, fame, creation, and the name of the Tirthankara. One high
lineage is auspicious, and Sadvaidyam. These forty-two natures are called
"punya".  **Special Meaning:** This sutra discusses the bondage of the region.
The pudgala atoms that are taken in the form of karma undergo transformation in
eight or seven ways, such as knowledge-obscuring karma, etc. Their intake is
always happening in the state of the world. The main cause of intake is yoga.
They are subtle. The intake of karma atoms occurs in the region where the soul
is situated. The intake of other karma atoms does not occur. The karma atoms
that are taken in reside in all the regions of the soul, and they are infinite.
This is the meaning of this sutra. From this, the general outline of the bondage
of the region and its cause become known.  8781. After the objects of bondage,
merit and demerit have been enumerated, and their inclusion in bondage has been
declared, it is to be stated here what is the bondage of merit and what is the
bondage of demerit. In this regard, this sutra is begun for the enumeration of
the nature of merit:  **Sadvaidyashubhayurnamagotrasani punyam ||25||** 8782.
"Shubha" means auspicious. This is connected with each of the subsequent terms,
such as auspicious life, auspicious name, and auspicious lineage. Auspicious
life is of three kinds: the life of a lower animal, the life of a human, and the
life of a god. There are thirty-seven varieties of auspicious name. For example,
the state of being a human, the state of being a god, the five-sense beings, the
five bodies, the three limbs and appendages, the square-shaped form, the strong
structure of a diamond, a bull, and a spear, auspicious color, auspicious taste,
auspicious smell, and auspicious touch, the sequence of human states and the
sequence of god states, these two, the heavier and the lighter, the striking,
the exhaling, the heat, the radiance, the auspicious state of non-attachment,
fear, haste, fulfillment, each body, stability, auspiciousness, prosperity, good
voice, receiving, fame, creation, and the name of the Tirthankara. One high
lineage is auspicious, and Sadvaidyam. These forty-two natures are called
"punya".  **Special Meaning:** Here, forty-two auspicious natures are
enumerated. Those that have more sections due to auspicious results are
auspicious natures. This characteristic occurs in these natures, therefore, they
are considered auspicious natures. In terms of bondage, the total number of
natures is considered to be 120. In this regard, the number forty-two is
specified here. Here, instead of enumerating twenty sub-categories of color,
etc., only four categories are enumerated. The commentator of the Tattvartha-
bhashya, Acharya Gṛddhapichchha, has also included samyaktva-prakriti, laughter,
pleasure, and purusha-veda in the auspicious natures. And Vira Sena Swami has
also established them as auspicious natures in the Jayadhavala commentary. Thus,
the total number of auspicious natures is indicated. 1. Punya-bandha-prakriti-

## Chapter Eight  **Other than this, the remaining are all of the nature of
sin.** ||26||  § 783.  The group of karmic actions that are different from the
group of karmic actions known as "punya" (meritorious) are called "papa"
(sinful). They are of eighty-two types. For example:  * Five types of **jnana-
avaran** (knowledge obscuring) * Nine types of **darshan-avaran** (perception
obscuring) * Twenty-six types of **mohaniya** (delusive) * Five types of
**antaraya** (hindering) * **Naraka-gati** (hellish rebirth) * **Tiryag-gati**
(animal rebirth) * Four **jati** (castes) * Five **samsthana** (physical forms)
* Five **samhanana** (physical constitutions) * **A-prashasta** (undesirable)
**varna** (color), **rasa** (taste), **gandha** (smell), and **sparsa** (touch)
* **Naraka-gati-anupurvi** (successive hellish rebirths) and **Tiryag-gati-
anupurvi** (successive animal rebirths) - these two * **Upadhata** (harmful) *
**A-prashasta viha-yoga-gati** (undesirable state of liberation) * **Sthavara**
(immobile) * **Sukshma** (subtle) * **A-paryapti** (insufficiency) *
**Sadharana-sharira** (ordinary body) * **Asthira** (unstable) * **A-shubha**
(inauspicious) * **Dur-bhag** (unfortunate) * **Du-svara** (harsh voice) *
**Anadeya** (unworthy of respect) * **A-yasha** (disgrace)  These are thirty-
four types of **nama-karma** (name-karma), **asa-vedaniya** (unpleasant),
**naraka-ayu** (hellish lifespan), and **neecha-gotra** (low birth).  Thus, the
**bandha** (bondage) is explained in detail. It is known through **avadhi-
jnana** (clairvoyance), **mana-paryaya-jnana** (knowledge of the mind), and
**kevala-jnana** (omniscience), and is inferred from the **agama** (scripture)
taught by those who possess these knowledges.  **Special Note:** Here, the names
of the sinful karmic actions are mentioned. Those that lead to undesirable
results and accumulate more **anubhaga** (karmic potential) are sinful karmic
actions. Here, a total of eighty-two sinful karmic actions are listed. The five
**bandhana** (bondages) and **sanghata** (aggregates) are included in the five
bodies, and the two karmic actions of **misra-mohaniya** (mixed delusive) and
**samyak-tva-mohaniya** (delusive of right conduct) are not included. Also, the
twenty **varna** (color) etc. are both desirable and undesirable. This is why
they are included in both the meritorious and sinful karmic actions. Thus, there
are a total of eighty-two sinful karmic actions, whose names are mentioned in
the commentary.  Thus, the eighth chapter of the **Tattva-artha-vrutti**
(Commentary on the Principles of Reality), known as **Sarvartha-siddhi**
(Complete Fulfillment of All Purposes), is complete. ||8||

## Chapter 9  The twenty-five **prakritis** of **tiryanch-gati**, **madhyake
char sansthan**, **madhyake char sanhanan**, **tiryanch-gati prayogyaanupurvi**,
**udyot**, **aprashasht vihayogati**, **durbhag**, **duhswar**, **anaadey**, and
**neechgotra** bind the living being from **ekendriya** to **saasadan
samyagdrishti** **gunasthan**. Therefore, in the absence of **asanyam** arising
from **anantaanubandhi** **udaya**, their **sanvar** occurs further.  The ten
**prakritis** of **apratyakhyanaavaran krodha**, **apratyakhyanaavaran maan**,
**apratyakhyanaavaran maya**, **apratyakhyanaavaran lobha**, **manushyaayu**,
**manushya-gati**, **oudarik-sharira**, **oudarik ango-paang**, **vajrar-
shabhanaraach sanhanan**, and **manushya-gati prayogyaanupurvi**, which receive
**asrav** due to the **asanyam** arising from **apratyakhyanaavaran kshaya**,
bind the living being from **ekendriya** to **asanyat samyagdrishti**
**gunasthan**. Therefore, in the absence of **asanyam** arising from
**apratyakhyanaavaran kshaya**, their **sanvar** occurs further.  It is
noteworthy that **ayukarma** does not bind when **samyagmithyatva** **guna** is
present.  The four **prakritis** of **apratyakhyanaavaran krodha**, **maan**,
**maya**, and **lobha**, which receive **asrav** due to the **asanyam** arising
from **apratyakhyanaavaran kshaya**, bind the living being from **ekendriya** to
**sanyata-sanyat** **gunasthan**. Therefore, in the absence of **asanyam**
arising from **apratyakhyanaavaran kshaya**, their **sanvar** occurs further.
The **karma** that receives **asrav** due to **pramad** undergoes **sanvar** in
its absence. The **karma** that receives **asrav** due to **pramad** should be
understood to undergo **sanvar** further in the absence of **pramad** in the
**pramattasanyat** **gunasthan**. What is that **karma**? It is of six types,
differentiated by the **prakritis** of **asataavedaniya**, **arati**, **shok**,
**asthir**, **ashubha**, and **ayash-kirti**.  The beginning of **devaayu**
binding is due to **pramad**, and also due to **apramad** that is close to it.
Therefore, in its absence, its **sanvar** should be understood further.  The
**karma** whose **asrav** is only due to **kshaya** and not due to **pramad**
etc., undergoes **sanvar** in the absence of **kshaya**. That **kshaya**, which
is devoid of **pramad** etc., is situated in the three **gunasthanas** as
**tivra**, **madhyam**, and **jagahnya**.  Of these, in the initial **sankhyey
bhaag** of the **apurvakaran** **gunasthan**, the two **karma-prakritis** of
**nidra** and **prachala** are bound. Further, in the **sankhyey bhaag**, the
**prakritis** of **devagati**, **panchendriya jati**, **vaikriyak sharira**,
**aaharaka sharira**, **taijas sharira**, **karman sharira**, **samachaturasra
sansthan**,

spiritual development), the four natures of **hasya** (laughter), **rati**
(attachment), **bhaya** (fear), and **jugupsa** (aversion) are bound. These are
the natures that are bound by **tiivra kshaya** (intense passions), and their
**samvara** (cessation) occurs after the **vivishta bhaga** (designated portion)
due to the gradual cessation of intense passions. From the beginning of
**anivritti badar sampray** (the state of non-return) until the designated
portion, **puved** (pride) and **krodha** (anger) are bound. After that, in the
remaining designated portions, **mana** (ego) and **maya** (delusion) are bound.
At the end of this, **lobha** (greed) is bound. These natures are bound by
**madhyama kshaya** (moderate passions), and their **samvara** (cessation)
occurs after the **vivishta bhaga** (designated portion) due to the gradual
cessation of moderate passions. The sixteen natures of **jnana avarana**
(knowledge obscurations) (five), **darsana avarana** (perception obscurations)
(four), **yasha kirti** (fame and glory), **uccarga** (high birth), and
**antaraya** (internal obstacles) (five) are bound by **manda kshaya** (subtle

**samvara** (cessation) of **upashanta kshaya** (subdued passions), **kshina
kshaya** (diminished passions), and **sayoga kevali** (those who have attained
liberation through their own efforts) occurs due to **kevala yoga** (perfect
knowledge and perfect conduct). The **samvara** (cessation) of **ayoga kevali**
(those who have attained liberation through the efforts of others) occurs due to
the absence of **yoga** (knowledge and conduct).  **Explanation:** **Samvara**
(cessation) is the path of preventing new karmas (actions) and their causes from
accumulating. Only after **samvara** (cessation) can the accumulated karmas and
their causes be purified, leading to liberation. This passage explains the
karmas and their causes in detail, according to their order in the **gunasthan**
(stages of spiritual development). All beings should understand this and strive
for **samvara** (cessation).  8788. The **samvara** (cessation) has been
explained. Now, to explain its causes, the next sutra says:  That **samvara**
(cessation) is achieved through **gupti** (secrecy), **samiti** (moderation),
**dharma** (righteousness), **anupreksha** (reflection), **parisahjaya**
(endurance), and **charitra** (conduct). ||2||

-9138791] Chapter Nine [321 6789.  Gupti is that which protects the soul from
the causes of the cycle of birth and death. Samiti is the right way of coming
and going, lifting and placing, taking and releasing, for the purpose of
avoiding harm to living beings. Dharma is that which is placed in the desired
place. Anupreksha is the repeated contemplation of the nature of the body and
other things. Parishha is the endurance of pain arising from hunger and other
sensations, for the purpose of destroying karma. Parishhajay is the victory of
endurance. The word Charitra has been explained in the first sutra. These, Gupti
etc., are the most helpful in the process of Samvara, therefore their role is
indicated in the sutra. Although Samvara is the main topic, it is referred to by
the word 'sa' in this sutra, to show its direct connection with Gupti etc.
Question - What is the purpose of this? Answer - The purpose is to establish
that Samvara can only be achieved through Gupti etc., and not through any other
means. This negates the practice of pilgrimage, abhisheka, taking initiation,
offering the head as a gift, and worshipping deities, because karma acquired
through attachment, aversion, and delusion cannot be destroyed otherwise. 8790.
To explain the specific causes of Samvara and Nirjara, the next sutra says:
Through tapas, there is Nirjara and also Samvara. ||3|| 8791. Tapas is included
in Dharma, yet it is mentioned separately to show that it is the cause of both
Samvara and Nirjara, and is the primary cause of Samvara. Question - Tapas is
considered to be the cause of liberation, because it is accepted as the means to
attain the state of Indra and other such places, so how can it be the cause of
Nirjara? Answer - There is no fault in this, because like fire, one thing can
have many functions. Just as fire, though one, has many functions like burning,
reducing to ashes, and producing embers, 1. 'Sanssaraduhkhalata sattvanyo

## 322] **On the attainment of all good**  [914 $ 792 There is no contradiction
in the fact that the purpose of ashes, etc., is obtained, and that it is the
cause of the destruction of the karma of the practice of austerity and its rise.
$ 792. To understand the nature of the secrecy mentioned in the beginning as the
cause of restraint, the following sutra says **Restraint of the yogas in a
proper way is secrecy.** ||4|| 8 793. Yoga has been explained in the sutra "Yoga
is the karma of body, speech, and mind." Restraint is the cessation of its
spontaneous activity. The qualifier "proper" is used to prohibit activity for
the sake of desire for worldly pleasures. Therefore, when there is restraint of
the yogas of body, etc., which is characterized by the qualifier "proper" and
which does not give rise to afflictions, the karma that is its cause does not
flow, and thus the attainment of restraint should be understood. It is of three
types: restraint of the body, restraint of speech, and restraint of the mind.
8794. Now, to make known the blameless conduct of the ascetic who is unable to
practice secrecy, the following sutra says **Walking, speech, effort, taking and
giving, and discharge are the five restraints.** ||5|| 8795. The word "proper"
is understood here. It qualifies walking, etc. Proper walking, proper speech,
proper effort, proper taking and giving, and proper discharge. These five
restraints should be known as the means for the ascetic who knows the rules of
the state of being, etc., to avoid harming living beings. Thus, restraint arises
from the flow of karma caused by the consequences of improper conduct of the one
who is acting. $ 796. To understand the difference in the third cause of
restraint, dharma, the following sutra says**

-916 8797] Chapter Nine 1323  Excellent forbearance, excellent gentleness,
excellent straightforwardness, excellent purity, excellent truthfulness,
excellent self-control, excellent austerity, excellent renunciation, excellent
non-attachment, and excellent celibacy are the ten types of Dharma. ||6|| 8 797.
Question: Why is this said? Answer: The first reason is to restrain the
tendencies. The second reason is to show the means of restraining the tendencies
to those who are unable to do so. This explanation of the ten types of Dharma
should be known to those who are engaged in the community, to avoid negligence.
Forbearance is the absence of defilement when a mendicant, seeking the cause of
the body's existence, encounters wicked people who insult, mock, scorn, beat,
and torture the body. Gentleness is the absence of pride arising from birth or
other sources. Straightforwardness is the absence of crookedness in the yogas.
Purity is the renunciation of greed that has been acquired through excellence.
Truthfulness is speaking good words to good people. Question: Does this fall
under the category of verbal restraint? Answer: This is not a fault, because a
muni who is engaged in the community speaks to both good and bad people in a way
that is beneficial and measured. Otherwise, there would be the fault of
punishment due to attachment. This is the meaning of verbal restraint. However,
according to the true Dharma, a muni who is engaged in the community, a virtuous
person, an initiated person, or their devotees, are allowed to inform others of
many duties, such as teaching knowledge and character, and they do all this for
the sake of the growth of Dharma. Therefore, true Dharma does not fall under the
category of verbal restraint. Self-control is the restraint of the senses of a
being who is engaged in the community. Austerity is the practice of penance for
the destruction of karma. This should be understood as the twelve types that
will be explained later. Renunciation is the giving of knowledge and other
things that are suitable for the self-controlled. Non-attachment is the
renunciation of the idea of "mine" in relation to the body and other things that
have been acquired, even in those things, for the purpose of eliminating karmic
impressions. One who has nothing is non-attached, and their state of mind or
action is non-attachment. The remembrance of a woman who has been experienced,
the hearing of stories about women,

[324] Sarvarthasiddhi [9178 798] By abstaining from sleeping and sitting with
women, one attains perfect Brahmacharya. Or, living in a Guru's house is
Brahmacharya for the purpose of giving up independent livelihood. The best
qualification is for the purpose of giving up the visible purpose. These are the
causes of Samvara, which are to be contemplated in this way, and which are
endowed with the designation of Dharma, and are imbued with the contemplation of
the virtues and the defects of the opposing party. 8798. It has been said that
anger, etc., do not arise from the contemplation of the opposite of Kshama, etc.
There it is said, why does this being take refuge in Kshama, etc., and does not
act otherwise? Because, like a heated iron ball, Kshama, etc., are to be done by
those who are self-interested and have become mature. Anitya, Asharana, Samsara,
Ekatva, Anyatva, Ashuchi, Asrava, Samvara, Nirjara, Loka, Bodhidurlabha, and
Dharmasvakhyatatva are the contemplations. ||7|| 799. These are the objects of
the body, senses, and enjoyment, which are in the form of aggregates, and are of
the nature of impermanence like water bubbles, and are always found in special
states like the womb, etc., and are opposite in nature to the combinations. Due
to delusion, the ignorant person considers them to be eternal. Nothing in the
world is permanent, except the nature of the self, which is the use of knowledge
and vision. This contemplation is the contemplation of impermanence. Thus, when
this Bhavy contemplates in this way, he does not have any attachment to them,
and even at the time of separation, he does not experience any distress, like
the smell of a garland that has been worn and then discarded. 8800. Just as
there is no refuge for a young deer caught by a strong, hungry, and flesh-eating
tiger in a secluded place, so also there is no refuge for a being in the world,
which is impermanent, without refuge, full of suffering, and full of misery. 1.

-917 $ 802] Chapter Nine [325 There is no refuge for a being wandering in the
midst of birth, old age, death, disease, and other afflictions. Even a well-
nourished body is helpful for food, not for the arrival of afflictions. Even
wealth accumulated with effort does not follow to the next life. Even friends
who have shared joys and sorrows equally cannot protect at the time of death.
Relatives gathered together cannot protect a being afflicted by disease. If
there is virtuous Dharma, it becomes a means of crossing the ocean of
afflictions. Even the thousand-eyed beings, being taken away by death, are not a
refuge. Therefore, in the midst of worldly afflictions, Dharma is the only
refuge. Even a good friend is not permanent, there is no other refuge, this kind
of contemplation is the contemplation of being without refuge. Thus, for one who
contemplates in this way, the constant feeling of "I am always without refuge"
leads to the abandonment of attachment to worldly things. Effort is made only in
the path ordained by the Bhagavan Arhat Sarvagna. 8801. The attainment of
another life due to the result of karma is samsara. It has been explained
earlier as five types of transformations. Wandering in this samsara, which is
filled with countless births, families, and millions of hardships, the being,
driven by the karma-machine, becomes a father, brother, son, and grandson. It
becomes a mother, sister, wife, and daughter. It becomes a master and then a
servant. It becomes a servant and then a master. Like an actor on a stage. Or
what is the point of saying more, it even becomes its own son. This kind of
contemplation of the nature of samsara is the contemplation of samsara. Thus,
contemplating in this way, one who is anxious due to the fear of the suffering
of samsara becomes dispassionate. And being dispassionate, one strives to
abandon samsara. $ 802. The experience of the great suffering of the cycle of

326] Sarvarthasiddhi [917 $ 803] I am born alone, and I die alone. No one,
neither kin nor stranger, can alleviate my suffering from disease, old age, and
death. Relatives and friends do not go beyond the cremation ground. Dharma is my
only helper, my eternal companion. This contemplation of oneness is
Ekattvanupreksha. Thus, one who contemplates in this way does not develop
attachment to loved ones, nor hatred towards strangers. Having attained
detachment, he strives only for liberation. 803. Contemplation of otherness from
the body is Anyatvanupreksha. For example, even though there is no difference in
essence with respect to a bond, due to the difference in characteristics, 'I' am
different. The body is sensory, I am non-sensory. The body is ignorant, I am the
knower. The body is impermanent, I am eternal. The body has a beginning and an
end, I am beginningless and endless. In the course of my wanderings in the
world, countless bodies of mine have passed away. I am different from them.
Thus, if I am different from the body, then, O dear one, what is the wonder if I
am different from external objects? Thus, the mind of one who contemplates in
this way does not develop attachment to the body and other things. As a result,
with the intense detachment that arises from the contemplation of the true
nature of things, one attains the ultimate bliss of liberation. 804. This body
is the womb of extremely impure substances. It has grown from impure substances
like semen and blood. It is a receptacle of impure substances like a latrine. It
is covered only by skin. It is a fountain of extremely foul-smelling juice. It
quickly destroys even the things that come into its shelter, like a burning
coal. Even by bathing, anointing, incense, rubbing, and wearing garlands, its
impurity cannot be removed. But the right vision, when contemplated properly,
reveals the ultimate purity of the soul. This contemplation of the true nature
of things is Ashuchitanupreksha. Thus, one who contemplates in this way is
detached from the body. 1. I am born alone.  2. They do not go beyond the
cremation ground. 3. The body is sensory, I am non-sensory. 4. One attains the
ultimate bliss of liberation. 5. This body is the womb of extremely impure
substances like semen and blood.

It then focuses its mind on crossing the ocean of birth.  805. The concepts of
*āsrava*, *samvara*, and *nirjarā* have been previously explained, but they are
being discussed again here to understand their qualities and defects.  *Āsrava*
is the cause of suffering in this world and the next.  It is as sharp as the
flow of a great river and takes the form of the senses, passions, and non-
observance of vows.  The senses, such as touch, lead beings like elephants,
crows, snakes, insects, and deer into the ocean of suffering.  Similarly,
passions like anger, pride, deceit, and greed cause suffering like death,
bondage, disgrace, and torment in this world.  In the next world, they cause
beings to wander through various realms of existence, burning with various kinds
of suffering.  Reflecting on the defects of *āsrava* is called *āsrava-
anuprekṣā*.  Such contemplation does not diminish the understanding of the
virtues like forgiveness.  All these defects of *āsrava* do not affect a soul
that has withdrawn itself like a tortoise.  806. Just as a boat in the vast
ocean, if its holes are not covered, will inevitably sink due to the influx of
water, and if its holes are covered, it will reach its desired destination
without any trouble, similarly, when the doors of karma are closed, there is no
obstacle to liberation.  Reflecting on the virtues of *samvara* is called
*samvara-anuprekṣā*.  Such contemplation leads to constant effort in *samvara*
and ultimately to the attainment of liberation.  807. *Nirjarā* is the name
given to the ripening of karma.  It is of two types: *abuddhi-pūrva*
(unconscious) and *kuśala-mūla* (virtue-based).  The *abuddhi-pūrva* *nirjarā*
arises from the ripening of karma in the realms of hell, etc., and is associated
with unwholesome actions.  The *kuśala-mūla* *nirjarā* arises from the conquest
of passions and is associated with wholesome actions.  It can be further divided
into *śubha-anubandha* (associated with auspicious karma) and *nir-anubandha*
(not associated with any karma).  Reflecting on the qualities and defects of
*nirjarā* is called *nirjarā-anuprekṣā*.  Such contemplation leads to detachment
and a focused mind on crossing the ocean of birth.

the purity of knowledge of the truth is achieved for this seeker. 6809. In one
nigoda body, there are infinite qualities of Jivas from the Siddhas. In this
way, the entire world is constantly filled with stationary beings. Therefore, in
this world, obtaining the state of liberation is as rare as finding a grain of
sand in a sea of sand. Even in that, due to the abundance of beings with
defective senses, obtaining the five senses is as rare as obtaining gratitude in
qualities. Even in that, there are many animals, deer, birds, and reptiles, so
obtaining the human state is as difficult as finding a treasure trove on a
crossroads. And even after obtaining the human state, its loss and subsequent
rebirth are as difficult as the rebirth of a burnt tree from its pudgalas. If by
chance it is obtained again, then country, family, sensory faculties, and
freedom from disease are increasingly difficult to obtain. Even after obtaining
all these, if the attainment of the right Dharma does not happen, then the birth
of a human being is as useless as a mouth without sight. Obtaining that Dharma,
which is so difficult to obtain, and then indulging in worldly pleasures is as
futile as burning sandalwood for ashes. However, for one who is detached from
worldly pleasures, the attainment of Samadhi, characterized by the practice of
austerity, the influence of Dharma, and a happy death, is very rare. When this
happens, the attainment of Bodhi is fruitful, contemplating this is
Bodhidurlabhanupreksha. In this way, contemplating this, the one who

-9186 813] Ninth Chapter [329 Negligence never occurs. 8810. This Dharma, taught
by the Jina, is characterized by non-violence, truth is its foundation, humility
is its root, forgiveness is its strength, it is protected by celibacy,
tranquility is its essence, destiny is its characteristic, and non-attachment is
its support. Due to the lack of this, beings wander in the endless cycle of
birth and death, experiencing suffering caused by the consequences of bad karma.
However, upon attaining this, liberation is certain, preceded by the attainment
of various kinds of progress. This contemplation is Dharma-svakhyatatva-
anupreksha. Thus, contemplating this, one always strives for its attainment due
to devotion to Dharma. 8811. In this way, by the proximity of anupreksha of
impermanence, etc., great restraint arises from the upholding of supreme
forgiveness, etc. The word 'anupreksha' in the middle has a double meaning. By
contemplating anupreksha, one upholds supreme forgiveness, etc., and strives to
conquer the obstacles. 8812. What are those obstacles, and why are they endured?
This is explained by the sutra: Obstacles are to be endured for the sake of not
deviating from the path and for the sake of their destruction. ||8|| 8813. Since
restraint is the subject matter, it is an attribute of the path. Therefore, the
word 'path' in the sutra should be understood as the path of restraint.
Obstacles are to be endured for the sake of not deviating from it and for the
sake of their destruction. Those who endure hunger, thirst, etc., do not deviate
from the path taught by the Jina, and by their continuous practice of the path,
they close the door to the inflow of karma, experience the preliminary fruits of
karma, and gradually destroy their karma, attaining liberation. Negligence does

trials, the next aphorism is spoken: Hunger, thirst, cold, heat, bites of
insects, nakedness, aversion, women, walking, sitting, lying down, crying out,
begging, lack of gain, disease, contact with grass, excrement, honor and
dishonor, knowledge, ignorance, and non-perception, these are the trials. ||9||
8815. Hunger and the other specific pains are twenty-two in number. A seeker of
liberation should endure these. For example, a mendicant who seeks blameless
food, who does not experience the pain of hunger when he does not get food or
when he gets only a little, who does not desire food at the wrong time or in the
wrong place, who does not endure even a little loss of what is necessary, who is
devoted to study, meditation, and contemplation, who has repeatedly performed
austerities of fasting and humiliation, who eats tasteless food, whose throat is
dry like a few drops of water that have fallen into a very hot vessel, who, even
when the pain of hunger is aroused, considers the lack of food to be more
meritorious than the gain of food, his non-thinking about the pain of hunger is
the conquest of the trial of hunger. 8816. He who has renounced bathing in
water, immersing himself in it, and being sprinkled with it, whose seat and
dwelling are not fixed like those of a bird, who is not distressed by excessive
salty, oily, or dry food, by the heat of the sun, by fever due to bile, by
fasting, and so on, who does not feel aversion to the thirst that arises from
these and that agitates the body and senses, and who quenches the fire of thirst
with the cool, fragrant water of meditation, filled in a new earthen pot of
fortitude, his endurance of thirst is praiseworthy. 8817. He who has renounced
clothing, whose dwelling is not fixed like that of a bird, who lives at the
roots of trees, on paths, or on the surface of rocks,

## Chapter Nine:  Praise for the Endurance of Cold and Bites  **818.**  In a
windless, waterless, sun-scorched forest, devoid of shade and filled with dry,
fallen leaves, where the heat generated by internal austerities like fasting
burns intensely, and the scorching heat of fire, harsh wind, and sun dries the
throat and palate, one who has experienced many remedies for this heat but does
not contemplate them, whose mind is focused on alleviating the suffering of
beings, and who maintains their vows, is praised for their endurance of heat.
**819.**  The term "bite-inflicting insects" is used as a general term. Just as
the term "crow" in the phrase "Protect the ghee from crows" is used to represent
all harmful creatures, so too, the term "bite-inflicting insects" includes
biting insects, flies, fleas, gnats, bedbugs, beetles, ants, scorpions, and so
on. One who endures the pain inflicted by these creatures without seeking any
remedy, who does not harm them in thought, word, or deed, and whose only
aspiration is to attain liberation, is praised for their endurance of the pain
inflicted by bite-inflicting insects.  **820.**  One who embodies the pure,
unblemished nature of a child, whose attainment is impossible to request, who is
free from the vices of begging, protecting, and harming, who is free from
possessions and whose sole means of attaining liberation is non-attachment,
whose mind is free from fluctuations and distractions, who visualizes women as
extremely impure and repulsive, who maintains unbroken celibacy day and night,
and who observes the vow of non-possession without any fault, is to be
understood as having attained the perfect vow of non-possession.  **821.**  One
who is restrained and indifferent to the objects of the senses, who avoids
music, dance, and musical instruments, who dwells in the roots of trees,
crossroads, and rocky places, and who, when snow falls and a cold wind blows,
does not desire any remedy but remains content, who does not remember the
remedies for cold that they have experienced in the past, and who dwells in the
storehouse of knowledge and contemplation, is worthy of praise for their
endurance of the pain of cold.

## 332] Sarvarthasiddhau  [919 $ 822] In empty houses, groves of trees, caves in
rocks, and other such places, one who is absorbed in self-study, meditation, and
contemplation, who remembers what they have seen, heard, and experienced, whose
heart is impervious to the entry of the arrows of desire, and who is always
compassionate towards all beings, should be understood to have conquered the
obstacle of aversion.  [8822] In secluded gardens, buildings, and other such
places, one who is unmoved by the allurements of young women intoxicated by
passion, infatuation, and alcohol, who has restrained the passions of the senses
and the heart, who has rejected seductive smiles, soft words, amorous glances,
laughter, and languid movements, and who has rendered the arrows of Cupid
ineffective, should be understood to have conquered the obstacle of aversion to
women.  [8823] One who has lived in a gurukul for a long time, has practiced
celibacy, has understood the nature of bondage and liberation, has become a
guest in a foreign land for the sake of the practice of restraint and devotion
to the body of restraint, has been granted permission by their guru, embraces
detachment like the wind, has endured many hardships like fasting, emaciation,
counting breaths, and renunciation of taste, whose body is weary due to these
hardships, who avoids travel that is not in accordance with the principles of
time and place, who has renounced footwear, who remembers to travel by
appropriate vehicles and conveyances even when their feet are pierced by sharp
gravel, thorns, and other such things, and who fulfills all necessary
obligations in a timely manner, should be understood to have conquered the
obstacle of aversion to conduct.  [6824] One who dwells in cremation grounds,
gardens, empty houses, mountain caves, and deep pits, where they have not
previously resided, who has established a code of conduct in a place that has
been tested by the light of the sun and the knowledge of their own senses, who
sits in a fixed posture for a set period of time, and who is not afraid of the
various terrifying sounds of lions, tigers, and other such creatures, should be
understood to have conquered the obstacle of aversion to fear.

## Chapter Nine  **8825.** The victory over the obstacle of sitting
(**Niṣadyāpariṣaha-vijaya**) is ascertained for one who, due to the fatigue
caused by self-study, meditation, and walking, experiences sleep for a muhūrta
in a region of the earth that is harsh, uneven, and abundant with pebbles and
shards, extremely cold and extremely hot, and who, while lying down in a
particular way, either on one side or in a stretched-out posture, does not
change position to avoid harming living beings, like a fallen tree or a corpse,
whose mind is absorbed in knowledge and contemplation, whose body does not move
even when subjected to various obstacles caused by external factors, and who
endures the pain caused by these obstacles for an indefinite period.  **8826.**
The victory over the obstacle of anger (**Ākrośa-pariṣaha-sahaṇa**) is
ascertained for one who, even while hearing harsh, contemptuous, abusive, and
insulting words that are fueled by the fire of anger and uttered by those driven
by false views, does not let his mind become attached to them, even though he is
capable of retaliating immediately, but instead contemplates that this is the
result of past evil deeds, and who, upon hearing these words, remains steadfast
in his contemplation of the practice of austerities, does not allow even a trace
of the poison of passions to enter his heart.  **8827.** The victory over the
obstacle of physical pain (**Niṣadyāpariṣaha-vijaya**) is ascertained for one
whose body is being tortured by sharp swords, maces, and hammers, and who, even
while being beaten, does not experience any mental disturbance, thinking, "This
is the result of my past evil deeds. What can these unfortunate beings do? This
body is like a water bubble, destined to perish. They are inflicting this
extreme pain because of the cause of suffering. My right knowledge, right faith,
and right conduct cannot be destroyed by any obstacle."

## 334] Sarvarthasiddhi  [919 $ 828] One who contemplates that the mind is burnt
by knowledge, is considered to have conquered the challenge of death, as he is
indifferent to the application of sandalwood paste and the removal of dirt.
[8828] One who is dedicated to the practice of both external and internal
austerities, whose body has been purified by the force of such contemplation,
whose body is like a tree devoid of shade, with only skin, bones, and a network
of veins remaining, due to the intense heat of the sun, who does not beg for
food, shelter, or medicine even when facing death, using words of humility, a
pale face, and gestures, and whose form is as difficult to perceive as lightning
during the day, is considered to have conquered the challenge of begging.
[6829] One who is unattached like the wind, who wanders through many lands, who
accepts only one meal a day, who remains silent or follows the rules of speech,
whose principle is to show his body only once, whose vessel is only the palm of
his hand, who does not receive alms for many days or in many houses, whose mind
is free from distress, who is eager to test the nature of the giver, and who is
content with the thought that "even if I do not receive anything, it is the
greatest austerity for me," is considered to have conquered the challenge of
non-receipt.  [8830] One who understands that this body is the abode of all
impurities, that it is impermanent, and that it is not worthy of protection, who
is free from any attachment to the body due to the absence of any thoughts, who
considers the body as the cause for the accumulation, growth, protection, and
maintenance of the treasure of virtues, who has accepted the principle of the
body's existence, who accepts food that is beneficial like applying ointment to
a wound or cleaning dirt, who is not overwhelmed by the diseases caused by the
imbalance of eating and drinking, such as wind, even when afflicted by hundreds
of diseases at once, who does not succumb to them, who, even when possessing
many special austerities and the ability to obtain quick remedies, is
indifferent to the body due to detachment, is considered to have conquered the
challenge of disease.

- Chapter 9 [335 5831. The term 'tṛṇa' (grass) is used to denote any cause of
pain that is inflicted by a weapon. Therefore, when one experiences pain in the
feet due to dry grass, rough gravel, thorns, sharp earth, or a splinter, and
one's mind is not attached to it, and one constantly avoids harming living
beings in one's actions, speech, and posture, then one should know that this is
victory over the suffering caused by the contact with grass, etc. 6832. For one
who has taken the vow of non-bathing until death, in order to avoid harming non-
human beings, even when one experiences itching due to the accumulation of dust
brought by the wind, which is caused by the heat of the sun's rays, and which
has arisen from boils, scabies, and ringworm, and even when one is free from
scratching, rubbing, and other actions that alleviate itching, one whose mind is
focused on the accumulation of one's own impurities and the removal of
impurities through the cleansing of pure water, which is the essence of right
knowledge and conduct, and who is constantly striving to eliminate the
impurities of karma, is said to be enduring the suffering of impurities. 6833.
Respect means worship and praise. Reward means to do something in advance, such
as initiating an action or inviting someone. In this regard, he is showing me
disrespect. Although I have practiced celibacy for a long time, I am a great
ascetic, I know the difference between my time and others' time, and I have
defeated many opponents, yet no one shows me respect, devotion, or offers me a
seat with enthusiasm. It is only those with false views who are extremely
devoted, who, even though they do not know anything, consider everyone to be
omniscient, and who honor them by influencing their time. The Vyantaras, etc.,
used to perform elaborate rituals for those who practiced very severe
austerities. If this is not a false tradition, then why don't they do the same
for those like us now? This is known as victory over the suffering of disrespect
and reward, which is the result of a mind devoid of right intention. 6834. I am

## 336] Sarvarthasiddhi  [919 8 835] It should be understood that the
elimination of the pride of knowledge is the victory over the Pariṣaha of
wisdom, just as the light of a firefly does not shine in the presence of the
sun's rays.  [8835] One should understand the victory over the Pariṣaha of
ignorance as the one who does not think, "I am ignorant, I am like an animal,"
even though he endures the scornful words of others, has practiced the most
difficult austerities, and has a mind that is always alert.  [8836] One whose
heart is purified by the feeling of supreme detachment, who knows the true
nature of all things, who is a devotee of the Arhat, Ayatana, Sadhu, and Dharma,
and who has been a renunciant for a long time, still does not experience the
transcendence of knowledge. The claim that special powers have arisen for those
who practice great fasts and other austerities is mere talk, this renunciation
is meaningless, the observance of vows is futile, etc. - one should understand
the endurance of the Pariṣaha of non-perception as the result of the
purification of vision, not considering these things in the mind.  [6837] Thus,
for one who endures the Pariṣaha that arise without any intention, and whose
mind is free from defilements, there is great restraint due to the cessation of
the flow of the karmic currents of attachment, aversion, etc.  [6838] It is
asked, "Do all these Pariṣaha arise for those who are striving to cross the
great forest of Samsara, or are there any special ones?" It is said here that
these Pariṣaha, such as hunger, etc., which have been described, are to be
experienced in relation to different types of conduct. However, in these two,
one should understand the following rules:  1. -Dhavakṣepa Mu. -Dyavikṣepa - Di.
1,2. 2. Me'dyatvepi Vijña - Mu. 3. -Ṣahan Saha - Mu.

## Chapter Nine  **10. There are fourteen types of Pariṣahas in Sūkṣma Sāmprāya
and Chhadmastha Vītarāga.**  839. Hunger, thirst, cold, heat, insect bites,
walking, sleeping, death, loss, disease, touch of grass, excrement, wisdom, and
ignorance are the fourteen Pariṣahas. The word "fourteen" in the sūtra indicates
that there are no other Pariṣahas.   **Doubt:** It is reasonable that the rule
of fourteen Pariṣahas applies to Chhadmastha Vītarāga because of the absence of
Mohaniya and the eight Pariṣahas mentioned later. However, in Sūkṣma Sāmprāya,
the rule of fourteen Pariṣahas does not seem to apply because Mohaniya is
present.  **Resolution:** This is incorrect because Mohaniya is present. In
Sūkṣma Sāmprāya, there is only the arousal of the Kṣaya of greed, and that too
is very subtle. Therefore, since it is similar to Chhadmastha Vītarāga, the rule
of fourteen Pariṣahas applies there as well.  **Doubt:** Since there is no
support for the arousal of Mohaniya and it is slow, there is no experience of
pain like hunger, etc. Therefore, the term "Pariṣaha" does not apply to their
actions.  **Resolution:** This is not true because only the power is intended.
Just as we refer to the ability of the Sarvārthasiddhi Dev to travel to the
seventh earth, we should understand it here as well.  **11. There are eleven
Pariṣahas in a Jina.**  840. If it is acknowledged that Pariṣahas are present in
a soul with a body, then how many Pariṣahas are experienced by a liberated soul
who has attained Kevala Jnāna and is subject to the fruits of the four karmas?
This is explained here.  841. In a Jina who has destroyed the four destructive
karmas, there are eleven Pariṣahas due to the presence of Vedaniya karma.
**Doubt:** Since there is no support for the arousal of Mohaniya and there is no
experience of pain like hunger, etc., the term "Pariṣaha" does not apply.
**Resolution:** This is not true because only the power is intended. Just as we
refer to the ability of the Sarvārthasiddhi Dev to travel to the seventh earth,
we should understand it here as well.

[338] Sarvarthasiddhi [91118 841] Even though there is no feeling of pain, the
term "parishah" is used due to the presence of dravyakarma. Similarly, even
though there is no cessation of thought due to the complete destruction of
jnanaavarana, the term "dhyana" is used due to the result of karma destruction.
Alternatively, the remaining part of the sentence "they do not exist" should be
assumed for the eleven Jinas, as the sutras are suggestive. This is based on the
assumption that "the remaining part of the sentence should be assumed and the
sentence is subject to the speaker." The remaining part of the sentence "they do
not exist" is assumed due to the absence of feelings like hunger, etc., which
are aided by the rise of moha. The statement that "parishah" is not appropriate
in the absence of feelings like hunger, etc., is true. However, even in the
absence of feelings, the term "parishah" is used here due to the presence of
dravyakarma. Just as the term "dhyana" is used even in the absence of cessation
of thought due to the complete destruction of jnanaavarana, which reveals the
secrets of all substances, due to the result of karma destruction, similarly,
the term "parishah" should be understood here. Alternatively, the remaining part
of the sentence "there are no eleven parishah in the Jina Bhagavans" should be
assumed, as the sutras are suggestive. It is also accepted that "the remaining
part of the sentence should be assumed and the sentence is subject to the
speaker." The remaining part of the sentence "they do not exist" is assumed due
to the absence of feelings like hunger, etc., which are aided by the rise of
moha. Special Meaning - The Jina Bhagavans experience the rise of asata
vedaniya, which is the cause of feelings like hunger, etc. Therefore, the eleven
parishah are referred to here from the perspective of the cause of the Jina
Bhagavans. However, the question arises whether the Jina Bhagavans actually
experience the eleven parishah like hunger, etc. The commentary provides two
solutions to this question. Firstly, the existence of the eleven parishah like
hunger, etc., is indicated due to the presence of the cause of their existence,
but from the perspective of action, the Jina Bhagavans do not experience the
eleven parishah like hunger, etc. Therefore, from this perspective, the
remaining part of the sentence "they do not exist" is assumed and their non-
existence is stated there. Now, it needs to be understood how the Jina Bhagavans
do not experience the eleven parishah like hunger, etc. They are not found in
this time, so it cannot be known by direct observation. Only the arguments that
support the Agamas remain, by relying on which this can be understood.
Therefore, they are indicated here - 1. The Kevali Jinas do not have nigoda and
trasas in their bodies. They are the possessors of the supreme audarik body due
to the absence of kshina moha in their gunasthan. Therefore, they do not
experience the hindrance of hunger, thirst, and diseases, as the cause of these
does not exist. The special quality that exists in the bodies of the Devas due
to the absence of these beings is multiplied infinitely in their bodies. 2. As
one ascends the ladder of श्रेणि, the proportion of auspicious natures increases
infinitely, and the proportion of inauspicious natures decreases infinitely at
every moment. Therefore, the rise of asata nature in the thirteenth gunasthan is
not so powerful that it can be considered as an indicator of actions like
hunger, etc. 3. The stimulation of asata occurs only up to the sixth gunasthan,
not beyond. Therefore, in the absence of stimulation, the vedaniya karma is
unable to cause feelings like hunger, etc. Since the bodies of the Kevali Jinas
do not require water and food, how can they experience hunger and thirst due to
their non-availability? 1. 'Kalyo hi vakyasesho vakyam vaktarvadhinam hi' - Pa.

-9112 8 843] Ninth Chapter [339 8 842. It is said, if there are separate
Pariṣahas in Sūkṣma-Sāmprāya etc., then where are all of them together? "All
Pariṣahas are possible in Bādarasaṃpārāya." ||12|| 8843. Sāmpārāya is Kṣaya. One
whose Sāmpārāya is Bādar is called Bādarasaṃpārāya. This is not the acceptance
of a particular Guṇasthāna. What then? It is a meaningful instruction. By this,
the acceptance of Pramatta etc. and the restrained ones is done. In them,
because of the non-diminishing nature of Kṣaya and Dosha, all Pariṣahas are
possible. In which conduct are all Pariṣahas possible? In each of Samāyika,
Chhedopasthāpana, Parihāra, Viśuddhi, and Samyama, all Pariṣahas are possible.
The function of Vedaniya Karma is not the absence of water element and food
element in the body. In fact, their absence is due to other reasons. Yes, the
pain that occurs for the fulfillment of their absence is the work of Vedaniya
Karma. So, when the body of the Kevali Jina does not have any need, how can the
pain caused by Vedaniya occur? That is, it cannot occur. 4. The Āsrava of the
Kevali Jina is always present, so its Nirjarā also always occurs. Therefore, in
the time when Asātaka arises, it does not arise alone, but it arises with the
Sātaka, which is infinitely powerful. Suppose that at that time, its own arising
is happening, but it happens along with the Nirjarā of the Sātaka Karma-
paramaṇus that bind every moment. Therefore, the arising of Asātaka cannot be
the cause of pain like hunger there. 5. Even though the Vedana of Sukha-Duḥkha
is the function of Vedaniya Karma, it happens only with the help of Mohaniya.
Since the Kevali Jina lacks Mohaniya, it does not seem reasonable to believe in
the existence of pain like hunger there. From these proofs, it is certain that
the Kevali Jina does not have eleven Pariṣahas like hunger. 6842. It is said -
If there are separate Pariṣahas in Sūkṣma-Sāmprāya etc., then to tell where they
are together, the next sūtra is said: All Pariṣahas are possible in
Bādarasaṃpārāya. ||12|| 8 843. Sāmpārāya is called Kṣaya. One whose Sāmpārāya is
Bādar is called Bādarasaṃpārāya. This is not the acceptance of a particular
Guṇasthāna. What then? It is a meaningful instruction. By this, the acceptance
of Pramatta etc. and the restrained ones is done. In them, because of the non-
diminishing nature of Kṣaya and Dosha, or Kṣaya-Dosha, all Pariṣahas are
possible. Doubt - Then in which conduct are all Pariṣahas possible? Solution -
Samāyika, Chhedopasthāpana, Parihāra, Viśuddhi, and Samyama, in each of these,
all Pariṣahas are possible. Special Meaning - Bādarasaṃpārāya is another name
for the ninth Guṇasthāna called Anivṛttikaraṇa. Up to the ninth Guṇasthāna, the
existence of Sthūla Kṣaya is present. Therefore, by the Antadīpaka Nyāya, this
Guṇasthāna is also Bādarasaṃpārāya. Here, the word "Bādarasaṃpārāya" does not
refer to this Guṇasthāna, so it is prohibited in the commentary, because twenty-
two Pariṣahas are possible in Bādarasaṃpārāya, not in the ninth Guṇasthāna
called Bādarasaṃpārāya. The reason is that the arising of Darśana-Mohaniya does
not occur in this Guṇasthāna. There are three types of Darśana-Mohaniya. Among
them, the arising of Samyaktva-Mohaniya is possible only up to the seventh
Guṇasthāna, because Vedaka Samyaktva is present only up to this point.
Therefore, here, Bādar1. Samstāḥ kveti Mu. 2. "Nisejjā jāyaṇākosō araī

[340] Sarvarthasiddhi [91148844844. It is said that the specific location of
these Pariṣahas has been determined, but we do not know what the function of
each nature is. Therefore, it is said here: In the presence of Jñānāvaraṇa,
there are Prajñā and Ajñāna Pariṣahas. ||13|| 8845. This is not right. What is
not right here? It is acceptable that Ajñāna Pariṣaha arises in the presence of
Jñānāvaraṇa, but Prajñā Pariṣaha arises in its absence. How can it be in the
presence of Jñānāvaraṇa? It is said here: The Kṣayopaśamika Prajñā generates
pride in the presence of other Jñānāvaraṇas, but not in the absence of all
Avaraṇas. Therefore, it is acceptable that Prajñā Pariṣaha exists in the
presence of Jñānāvaraṇa. 8846. To further explain the specific nature of the
other two Pariṣahas, it is said: In the presence of Darśana-moha and Antarāya,
there are Adarśana and Alābha Pariṣahas respectively. ||14|| 6847. The word
"Yathāsaṅkhya" is related to this sūtra. In the presence of Darśana-moha, there
is Adarśana Pariṣaha, and in the presence of Lābhāntarāya, there is Alābha
Pariṣaha. It should be understood that all Pariṣahas are possible in the gross
Kṣaya, i.e., Sāmpārāya. 6844. It is said: The specific location of these
Pariṣahas has been determined, but we do not know what the function of each
nature is. Therefore, it is said here: In the presence of Jñānāvaraṇa, there are
Prajñā and Ajñāna Pariṣahas. ||13|| $ 845. The doubt is that this is not right?
Counter-doubt: What is not right here? Doubt: It is assumed that Ajñāna Pariṣaha
arises in the presence of Jñānāvaraṇa, but Prajñā Pariṣaha arises in its
absence. Therefore, how can it be in the presence of Jñānāvaraṇa? Solution: It
is said here: The Kṣayopaśamika Prajñā generates pride in the presence of other
Jñānāvaraṇas, but not in the absence of all Avaraṇas. Therefore, it is
acceptable that Prajñā Pariṣaha exists in the presence of Jñānāvaraṇa. - Special
meaning: The meaning of Vikalpa is Śruta-jñāna. Therefore, as long as Śruta-
jñāna exists, there is a Vikalpa like "I know more, this person does not know
anything." Although the person who makes this kind of Vikalpa gains more
knowledge due to the intense Kṣayopaśama of Jñānāvaraṇa karma, this Vikalpa
exists only as long as Kṣayopaśamika jñāna exists, and Kṣayopaśamika jñāna is
dependent on its arising. Therefore, the main cause of this kind of Vikalpa is
said to be the arising of Jñānāvaraṇa karma. Many beings have the feeling that
"I am a great sage, there is no one else who can match me," even though they
have the arising of Moha. But this feeling arising from the arising of Moha is
not considered here. Here, only the Vikalpa of considering a little knowledge as
great knowledge due to one's own ignorance is considered. Thus, it is certain
that there are two Pariṣahas, Prajñā and Ajñāna, in the presence of Jñānāvaraṇa.
846.. To further explain the specific nature of the other two Pariṣahas, the
next sūtra is said: In the presence of Darśana-moha and Antarāya, there are
Adarśana and Alābha Pariṣahas respectively. ||14|| 6 847. The word
"Yathāsaṅkhya" is related to this sūtra. In the presence of Darśana-moha, there
is Adarśana Pariṣaha, and in the presence of Lābhāntarāya, there is Alābha
Pariṣaha. _ Special meaning: The Samyaktvamohaṇīya nature is taken here from
Darśana-moha. While it is arising, Cala, Mala, and Agādha defects arise. Having
various Vikalpas about Āpta, Āgama, and objects while being Samyakta is the Cala
defect. Just as waves arise in water due to the presence of air, even though the
water is healthy, similarly, even though a Samyagdṛṣṭi person is  Pariṣaha
exists

## Chapter Nine  It is said that if there is one Pariṣaha due to the difference
in the Mohaniya of the first, then how many Pariṣahas are there due to the
difference in the second? Therefore, the next sūtra says:  **In the presence of
Cāritra-moha, there are the Pariṣahas of Nāgnī, Arati, Strī, Niṣadyā, Ākrośa,
Yācanā, and Satkāra-Puraskāra.** ||15||  **8848.** **Doubt:** The Pariṣahas of
Nāgnī, etc., are due to the cause of Veda-udaya, etc., therefore, Mohodaya is
said to be their cause. But how is the Niṣadyā Pariṣaha due to Mohodaya?
**Solution:** Even in that, because the avoidance of animal suffering is the
main thing, it is considered to be caused by Mohodaya, because when Mohodaya
occurs, the result in the form of animal suffering occurs.  **Special Meaning:**
Further, Carya and Śayyā are said to be caused by Vedaniya, and here Niṣadyā is
said to be caused by Mohaniya. All three Pariṣahas are of one category. Then
what is the reason that Niṣadyā is said to be caused by Mohodaya? If the
Pariṣahas of Carya and Śayyā are caused by Vedaniya, then why is this not
considered to be caused by Vedaniya? This is a question whose answer is given in
the Tīkā. There it is explained that the result in the form of animal suffering
is due to Mohodaya, and in the Niṣadyā Pariṣaha, there is a main emphasis on
conquering this type of result. This is the reason why Niṣadyā is considered to
be caused by Cāritra-moha. It is true that with this intention, the Pariṣahas of
Carya and Śayyā could also be considered to be caused by Mohodaya, but there,
because of the main emphasis on the pain caused by thorns, etc., the above two
Pariṣahas are said to be caused by Vedaniya. The meaning is that in Carya,
Śayyā, and Niṣadyā, there is animal suffering and...  [ 341

## 342] Sarvarthasiddhi [9116 8498849. To explain the nature of the remaining
Pariṣahas, the sūtra says: The remaining Pariṣahas are all dependent on
Vedaniya. ||16|| 8850. The eleven Pariṣahas have been mentioned earlier. The
remaining Pariṣahas are different from them and are dependent on Vedaniya. The
word "भवन्ति" (exist) is implied in the sūtra. What are these remaining
Pariṣahas? They are: Kṣudhā (hunger), Pipāsā (thirst), Śīta (cold), Uṣṇa (heat),
Daṃśa-maśaka (bite of insects), Carya (movement), Śayyā (lying down), Vadh
(killing), Roga (disease), Tṛṇa-sparśa (touch of grass), and Mala-pariṣaha
(excrement). 8851. The sūtra says: One to nineteen Pariṣahas can exist
simultaneously in a single soul. ||17|| 8852. The word "आङ्" (Aṅ) here signifies
possibility. This implies that nineteen Pariṣahas can also exist simultaneously
in a single soul. How is this possible? The answer is: In a single soul, only
one of the two Pariṣahas, Śīta and Uṣṇa, can exist at the same time, and only
one of the three Pariṣahas, Śayyā, Niṣadyā, and Carya, can exist at the same
time. This is because there is a conflict in having both Śīta and Uṣṇa, and all
three of Śayyā, Niṣadyā, and Carya, existing simultaneously. When these three
are excluded, the remaining Pariṣahas can exist simultaneously in a single soul,
making a total of nineteen possibilities. Now, someone might argue that there is
also a conflict between Prajñā (wisdom) and Ajñāna (ignorance), so they cannot
exist simultaneously. The answer is: In a single soul, Prajñā-pariṣaha is
dependent on Śruta-jñāna (knowledge gained from scriptures), while Ajñāna-
pariṣaha is dependent on Moha-nimitta (cause of delusion). Therefore, both can
exist simultaneously.  849. Now, to explain the specific nature of the remaining
Pariṣahas, the next sūtra says: All the remaining Pariṣahas exist in the
presence of Vedaniya. ||16|| 8850. Eleven Pariṣahas have been mentioned earlier.
The remaining Pariṣahas are different from them and are dependent on Vedaniya.
The word "भवन्ति" (exist) is implied in the sūtra. The question arises: What are
these remaining Pariṣahas? The answer is: Kṣudhā (hunger), Pipāsā (thirst), Śīta
(cold), Uṣṇa (heat), Daṃśa-maśaka (bite of insects), Carya (movement), Śayyā
(lying down), Vadh (killing), Roga (disease), Tṛṇa-sparśa (touch of grass), and
Mala-pariṣaha (excrement). Explanation: These Pariṣahas arise due to their
respective causes. For example, hunger arises due to lack of food in the body,
thirst arises due to lack of water, cold arises due to the cold season, heat
arises due to the hot season, bite of insects arises due to insects biting, pain
while moving or lying down arises due to thorns, etc., killing arises due to
someone killing, abuse arises due to someone abusing, disease arises due to
disease in the body, pain due to touching grass arises due to touching grass,
and excrement arises due to excrement in the body. The cause of these Pariṣahas
is not the arising of Vedaniya karma, but the pain of hunger, thirst, etc., that
arises due to these actions is the result of Vedaniya karma. This is the meaning
that should be understood here. 851. The sūtra says: One to nineteen Pariṣahas
can exist simultaneously in a single soul. ||17|| 8852. The word "आङ्" (Aṅ) here
signifies possibility. This implies that nineteen Pariṣahas can also exist
simultaneously in a single soul. The question arises: How is this possible? The
answer is: In a single soul, only one of the two Pariṣahas, Śīta and Uṣṇa, can
exist at the same time, and only one of the three Pariṣahas, Śayyā, Niṣadyā, and
Carya, can exist at the same time. This is because there is a conflict in having
both Śīta and Uṣṇa, and all three of Śayyā, Niṣadyā, and Carya, existing

simultaneously in a single soul, making a total of nineteen possibilities. Now,
someone might argue that there is also a conflict between Prajñā (wisdom) and
Ajñāna (ignorance), so they cannot exist simultaneously. The answer is: In a
single soul, Prajñā-pariṣaha is dependent on Śruta-jñāna (knowledge gained from
scriptures), while Ajñāna-pariṣaha is dependent on Moha-nimitta (cause of
delusion). Therefore, both can exist simultaneously.  1. Caryaṇām anyatam mu. 2.

## Chapter Nine  [343]  There is no contradiction in saying that ignorance-based
restraint is in relation to the absence of knowledge, while knowledge-based
restraint is in relation to knowledge.  8853. It is said that the five causes of
*sanvara* are: secrecy, council, dharma, non-expectation, and victory over
restraint. Now, the cause of *sanvara* called *charitra* should be stated.
Therefore, to show its different aspects, the following sutra is stated:
Samayika, Chhedopasthapana, Pariharavishuddhi, Sukshmasampray, and Yayakhyata
are the five types of *charitra*. ||18||  8854. Doubt: It has been stated that
*sanyama* is included in the ten types of *dharma*, and that is *charitra*.
Therefore, mentioning it again is pointless?  Resolution: It is not pointless,
because even though *charitra* is included in *dharma*, it is mentioned again at
the end to show that it is the direct cause of liberation.  Samayika has been
mentioned before.  Doubt: Where?  Resolution: While explaining the sutra
"Digdeshanarthadandaviratisamayika".  It is of two types: fixed-time and
unfixed-time. *Swadhyaya* etc. are fixed-time *samayika*, and *iryapatha* etc.
are unfixed-time *samayika*.  The proper reaction, i.e., the acceptance of vows
again, after the abandonment of the practice of *anarthaprabandha* caused by
negligence, i.e., the abandonment of the non-vows like violence etc., is called
*Chhedopasthapana charitra*. Or, the cessation of alternatives is called
*Chhedopasthapana charitra*.  Cessation from killing living beings is called
*parihar*. The *charitra* that has purity associated with it is called
*Pariharavishuddhi charitra*.  The *charitra* in which *kṣaya* becomes extremely
subtle is called *Sukshmasampray charitra*.  The *charitra* that is
characterized by the expectation of the state of the self, as it is due to the
complete pacification or destruction of all *mohaniya* karmas, is called
*Athyakhyata charitra*.  It is called *Athyakhyata* because it is not attained
before the pacification or destruction of *mohaniya* karmas, even though it has
been stated by those who practice the previous *charitra*.  The word "atha"
means "afterwards", so it means that it appears after the complete pacification
or destruction of *mohaniya* karmas.

## Chapter Nine  **The practice of austerities is described here. It is of two
types: external and internal. Each of these is further divided into six types.
The text first explains the external austerities.**  **External austerities are
of six types:**  1. **Anashan (fasting):** This is done without expecting any
visible results, for the sake of attaining self-control, eliminating attachment,
destroying karma, and achieving meditation and knowledge. 2. **Avamoudarya
(simple living):** This is done to maintain self-control, subdue negative
tendencies, cultivate contentment, and achieve the effortless practice of self-
study and other virtues. 3. **Vrittiparisankhyan (limiting activities):** This
involves limiting one's thoughts and activities to essential needs, especially
for a mendicant, to avoid unnecessary mental distractions and anxieties. 4.
**Rasaparitvag (renunciation of rich foods):** This is done to overcome pride in
the senses, conquer sleep, and achieve the effortless practice of self-study and
other virtues. 5. **Vivikta-shayyasan (solitary dwelling):** This involves
choosing a secluded place free from disturbances, for the sake of practicing
self-control, celibacy, self-study, meditation, and other virtues. 6.
**Kayaklesha (physical austerities):** This includes practices like sunbathing,
dwelling under trees, sleeping without a bed, and engaging in various forms of
physical hardship. These are done to cultivate endurance, overcome attachment to
pleasure, and enhance the effectiveness of teachings and spiritual practices.
**What is the difference between Pariksha (endurance) and Kayaklesha (physical
austerities)?**  Pariksha is endurance that arises spontaneously, while
Kayaklesha is self-inflicted physical hardship.  **Why are these austerities
considered external?**  They are considered external because they depend on
external objects and are visible to others.  **The text now explains the
internal austerities.**

##  Internal Penance (346)  **[9120 $ 858
Prāyaścittavinayavaiyāvṛttyasvādhāyavyutsargadhānānyuttaram ॥20॥]**
Prāyaścitta, Vinaya, Vaiyāvṛttya, Svādhyāya, Vyutsarga, and Dhyāna are the six
types of internal penance.  ||20||  **[8858. Kathamasyābhyantaratvam?
Manonīyamanārthatvāt. Pramāvadoṣaparihāraḥprāyaścittam. Pūjyeṣvādaro vinayaḥ.

svādhyāyaḥ. Ātmātmīyasankalpatyāgo vyutsargaḥ. Cittavīkṣepatyāgo dhyānam.]**
**[8858. How is this internal penance?** Because it is for the regulation of the
mind.  Prāyaścitta is the removal of faults arising from negligence.  Vinaya is
respect for the venerable.  Vaiyāvṛttya is worship through bodily actions or
other substances.  Svādhyāya is the abandonment of laziness and the cultivation
of knowledge.  Vyutsarga is the abandonment of the thought of self and mine.
Dhyāna is the abandonment of mental distractions.  **[8859.
Tabhedapratipādanārthamahā** **Navacaturdaśapancadvibhedā yathākramaṁ
prāradhyānāt ॥21॥]**  **[8859. To explain their distinctions, the next sūtra
says:** There are nine, four, ten, five, and two distinctions of the internal
penances, in order, beginning with Prāyaścitta. ||21||  **[8860. 'Yathākramam'

vacanaṁ dhyānasya bahuvaktvyatvātpaścādvakṣyata iti.]**  **[8860. The word
'yathākramam' indicates that:** Prāyaścitta has nine distinctions, Vinaya has
four, Vaiyāvṛttya has ten, Svādhyāya has five, and Vyutsarga has two.  The word
'prāgdhyānāt' indicates that Dhyāna will be discussed later, as there is much to
be said about it.  **[8861. Ādyasya bhedasvarūpanirjñānārthamahā**
**Pālocanapratikramaṇatadu bhayavivekavyu tsargatapaschchedaparihāropasthāpanāḥ
॥22॥]**  **[8861. To explain the nature of the distinctions of the first
internal penance, the next sūtra says:** Pālocanā, Pratikramaṇa, Tadubhaya,
Viveka, Vyutsarga, Tapa, Chheda, Parihāra, and Upastāpanā are the nine types of
Prāyaścitta. ||22||  **[8862. Tatra gurave pramādanivedanaṁ

Samsaktānnapānop**  **[8862. There, Pālocanā is the confession of one's
negligence to the guru, having avoided the ten faults.  Pratikramaṇa is the
expression of one's reaction by saying to the guru, "My fault is false."
Tadubhaya Prāyaścitta is the purification of faults when there is a connection
between Pālocanā and Pratikramaṇa.  Viveka Prāyaścitta is the separation of
food, drink, and utensils that have been in contact with the senses.**   **1.

## Chapter Nine:    **[347]  The Distinction of  *Karana* (Cause) and Other
Divisions**  * ***Vyutsarga*:**  The cause of *Kayotsarga* (abandonment of the
body) and other such practices. * ***Tapa*:**  The cause of *Anashana*
(fasting), *Avamoudarya* (humility), and other such practices. * ***Chheda*:**
The cause of the breaking of vows (like *Pravrajya*) by day, fortnight, month,
etc. * ***Parihara*:**  The cause of the abandonment of vows (like *Pravrajya*)
by fortnight, month, etc., and keeping oneself away from the community. *
***Upasthapana*:**  The cause of the re-initiation into vows.  **Explanation:**
Here, nine types of *Prayaschitta* (atonement) are mentioned. The word
*Prayaschitta* means "purification" or "atonement." It is the act of purifying
oneself from the defilement of karma.   These nine types of *Prayaschitta* are
the means by which a *Sadhu* (Jain monk) purifies himself from his faults.
**The First Type: *Aalocana* (Confession)**  * *Aalocana* is done without the
ten faults. * The ten faults are:     1. ***Upakaran* Fault:**  Providing
*Upakaran* (material support) to a *Sadhu* with the thought that he will receive
a lesser *Prayaschitta* in return.     2. ***Prakriti* Fault:**  Claiming to be
weak or unable to perform *Anashana* (fasting) or other practices, and then
blaming the *Sadhu* for giving a lesser *Prayaschitta*.     3. ***Mayaachar*
Fault:**  Hiding other unseen faults and confessing only the visible ones.
4. ***Sthula* Fault:**  Being indifferent to knowing one's own faults due to
laziness or carelessness.     5. ***Pancharcha* Fault:**  Hiding major faults
due to fear of severe *Prayaschitta* and confessing only minor faults.     6.
***Guru* Fault:**  Worshiping the *Guru* with the thought of what *Prayaschitta*
will be given for a particular fault.     7. ***Purva* Fault:**  Confessing a
fault due to the influence of other *Sadhus* who have confessed similar faults
during *Paakshik* (fortnightly) or *Chaturmasik* (four-month) practices.     8.
***Shaka* Fault:**  Doubting the validity of the *Prayaschitta* given by the
*Guru* and questioning its scriptural basis in front of other *Sadhus*.     9.
***Prayojana* Fault:**  Confessing a fault to a fellow *Sadhu* for a specific
purpose and receiving *Prayaschitta* from him.     10. ***Chhipana* Fault:**
Hiding one's fault by claiming that it is similar to the fault of another
*Sadhu* and that the *Prayaschitta* given to the other *Sadhu* is also
applicable to oneself.  * Any *Prayaschitta* done with these ten faults is not
fruitful.  **Other Names for the Ten Faults:**  * *Aakampit* * *Anumanit* *
*Drishta* * *Badar* * *Sookshma* * *Chhanna* * *Shabdaakulit* * *Bahujan* *
*Avyakt* * *Tatsevi*  **The Second Type: *Pratikramna* (Repentance)**  *
*Pratikramna* is the act of confessing one's fault with the intention of making
it false. * This is done by the disciple. * When *Pratikramna* is done with
*Aalocana* by the *Guru*, it is called *Tadu-bhay* (both).  **The Third Type:
*Tadu-bhay* (Both)**  * This is the third type of *Prayaschitta*.  **Other Types
of *Prayaschitta*:**  * The remaining types of *Prayaschitta* are named
according to their nature.  **Ten Types of *Prayaschitta* in *Mulaachar* (Basic
Conduct)**  * *Aalocana* * *Pratikramna* * *Tadu-bhay* * *Viveka* * *Vyutsarga*
* *Tapa* * *Chheda* * ***Mula* (Original)** * *Parihara* * *Shraddhan*
**Explanation by the Commentator:**  * The commentator interprets *Mula* as
equivalent to *Upasthapana* (re-initiation). * *Shraddhan* is a type of
*Prayaschitta* for mental faults, where one confesses the fault with the
intention of making it false.  **Footnotes:**  1. *Pravrajya* is the vow of
renunciation. 2. *Parivarjaniya* is something that should be abandoned.

[348] Sarvarthasiddhau [9123 6 8638863. To explain the different types of
Vinaya, the sutra says: Jnanavinaya, Darshanavinaya, Charitravinaya and
Upcharavinaya. ||23|| 8864. The word 'Vinaya' is related to this chapter. There
are four types of Vinaya: Jnanavinaya, Darshanavinaya, Charitravinaya and
Upcharavinaya. Jnanavinaya is the practice of acquiring knowledge, studying it
and remembering it with great respect for the sake of liberation. Darshanavinaya
is the faith in the truth of the scriptures without any doubts or flaws.
Charitravinaya is the focus of the mind on the right conduct. Upcharavinaya is
the practice of standing up, following behind and bowing to the Acharya and
other respected individuals in their presence. It also includes bowing to them
with body, speech and mind, praising their qualities and remembering them in
their absence. 8865. To explain the different types of Vaiyaavrutya, the sutra
says: Acharya, Upadhyaya, Tapasvi, Shaiksha, Glana, Gana, Kula, Sangh, Sadhu and
Manojna. ||24|| 8866. There are ten types of Vaiyaavrutya because its subject
matter is of ten types. For example, Acharya-Vaiyaavrutya and Upadhyaya-
Vaiyaavrutya, etc. The one who observes the vows is called Acharya. The one who
teaches the scriptures for liberation is called Upadhyaya. The one who practices
great fasts and other austerities is called Tapasvi. The one who is learning is
called Shaiksha. The one whose body is afflicted by diseases, etc. is called
Glana. The lineage of elders is called Gana. The group of disciples of the
initiating Acharya is called Kula. The assembly of Shramans of the four castes
is called Sangh. The one who has been a monk for a long time is called Sadhu.
The Sadhu who is acceptable to the people is called Manojna. When these people
suffer from diseases, hardships, or false beliefs, etc., they should be helped
by physical means or by other material means. 1. Tattvatascha - Mu.. 2. Ranti

-91268 870] Chapter Nine [349 The practice of *vaiyāvṛttya* is done for the sake
of attaining *samādhi*, the absence of doubt, and the expression of compassion
through preaching. 5867. To explain the different types of *svādhyāya*, the
sūtra says: *vācanā prachchanā anuprekṣā āmnāya dharma upadeśāḥ* ||25|| 8868.
*Vācanā* is the giving of the text, the meaning, or both without fault.
*Prachchanā* is questioning to remove doubt or to strengthen a firm belief.
*Anuprekṣā* is mental contemplation of the meaning that has been understood.
*Āmnāya* is the repetition of the text with correct pronunciation. *Dharma
upadeśa* is the practice of *dharma kathā* and other such things. What is the
purpose of these five types of *svādhyāya*? The purpose is to increase wisdom,
to make one's resolve firm, to attain supreme emotion, to increase one's
*tapas*, and to purify one's conduct, and so on. 8869. To explain the different
types of *vyutsarga* *tapas*, the sūtra says: *bāhyābhyantaropaḍhyoḥ* ||26||
8870. *Vyutsarjana* is *vyutsarga*, which means renunciation. It is of two
types: renunciation of external *upaḍhis* and renunciation of internal
*upaḍhis*. External *upaḍhis* are things like wealth, grain, and other things
that are not one with the self. Internal *upaḍhis* are mental states like anger.
Renunciation of the body for a fixed period or for life is also called
renunciation of internal *upaḍhis*. What is the purpose of this? The purpose is
to attain non-attachment, fearlessness, and the transcendence of the desire for
life, and so on. To practice *vaiyāvṛttya* is to practice *tapas*. This is done
to attain *samādhi*, to remove doubt, and to express compassion through
preaching. 8867. To explain the different types of *svādhyāya*, the sūtra says:
*vācanā, prachchanā, anuprekṣā, āmnāya, and dharma upadeśa* are the five types
of *svādhyāya* ||25|| 8868. *Vācanā* is the giving of the text, the meaning, or
both without fault. *Prachchanā* is questioning to remove doubt or to strengthen
a firm belief. *Anuprekṣā* is mental contemplation of the meaning that has been
understood. *Āmnāya* is the repetition of the text with correct pronunciation.
*Dharma upadeśa* is the practice of *dharma kathā* and other such things. The
question arises: why are these five types of *svādhyāya* practiced? The answer
is: to increase wisdom, to make one's resolve firm, to attain supreme emotion,
to increase one's *tapas*, and to purify one's conduct, and so on. 8869. To
explain the different types of *vyutsarga* *tapas*, the sūtra says: Renunciation
of external and internal *upaḍhis* are the two types of *vyutsarga* ||26|| 8870.
*Vyutsarjana* is *vyutsarga*, which means renunciation. It is of two types:
renunciation of external *upaḍhis* and renunciation of internal *upaḍhis*.
External *upaḍhis* are things like wealth, grain, and other things that are not
one with the self. Internal *upaḍhis* are mental states like anger. Renunciation
of the body for a fixed period or for life is also called renunciation of
internal *upaḍhis*. The purpose of this is to attain non-attachment,
fearlessness, and the transcendence of the desire for life, and so on. It is
important to note that the five great vows include the vow of non-possession,
the ten *dharmas* include the *dharma* of renunciation, and the nine types of
*prāyaścitta* include a *prāyaścitta* called *vyutsarga*. In this context, why
is *vyutsarga* *tapas* mentioned separately? This seems redundant, as it would
be repeating the same thing. The answer is that the vow of non-possession in the
five great vows refers to the renunciation of *upaḍhis* related to household
life. 1. -*mādhȳyān*  mu.। 2.  *vyaktārtham* ā., di. 1, di. 2, nā. ।

## 350] Sarvarthasiddhi [9127 88718871.  Although much has been said about
dhyana (meditation) and its various classifications, it is now time to discuss
its distinctions.  However, we will move beyond this and proceed to define the
nature, practitioner, and duration of dhyana. The restraint of thought on a
single object, for a period of antarmūhūrta, is dhyana, for one who possesses
the uttama samhanana. ||27|| 8872. The three types of samhanana, namely
vajrarṣabha-nārāca-samhanana, vajra-nārāca-samhanana, and nārāca-samhanana, are
considered uttama (excellent). All three are means to dhyana, but the first one
is the means to moksha (liberation). One who possesses these uttama samhananas
is called an uttama-samhanana-vala. The word "agra" refers to the "mouth" or
"point of focus". One who has a single agra is called ekāgra. When the mind is
distracted by various objects, it becomes agitated. Restraining it from all
other objects and focusing it on a single object is called ekāgra-cintā-nirodha.
This explains the nature of dhyana. Mūhūrta is a unit of time. Antarmūhūrta
refers to a period within a mūhūrta. The phrase "antarmūhūrta-āt" defines the
duration. After this period, ekāgra-cintā becomes difficult to maintain.
**Doubt:** If dhyana is the restraint of thought, and restraint is the absence
of thought, then dhyana would be like the horns of a donkey, i.e., non-existent.
**Resolution:** This is not a valid objection. Dhyana is considered non-existent
only in relation to the cessation of other thoughts. It is considered existent
because it is directed towards its object.  Absence is a different state of
being, and the existence of absence as a property of an object is established by
various arguments like the presence of a supporting factor, the absence of a
contradictory factor, etc. Alternatively, the word "nirodha" does not refer to
the cessation of thought. What then does it refer to? It refers to the restraint
of karma. "Nirodha" means "restraint". Thought is the main cause of karma. The
main aspect of tyaga-dharma (the virtue of renunciation) is the reduction of
attachment to objects like food. The main aspect of vyutsarga-prāyaścitta
(atonement through renunciation) is the purification of the faults that arise
from attachment to possessions. The main aspect of vyutsarga-tapa (austerity
through renunciation) is the renunciation of attachment to external factors like
desires and internal factors like the body and mind. Therefore, there is no
repetition of the same point. 6871. The various types of dhyana that have been

## Chapter Nine  [351] Nirodha and Chintan Nirodha. This means that the
knowledge which shines like a steady flame of fire is Dhyana.  8873. To show the
different types of Dhyana, the next Sutra says: Aarta, Raudra, Dharmya, and
Shukla are the four types of Dhyana. ||28|| 8874. The word Aarta is derived from
either 'Rta' or 'Ati'. 'Rta' means sorrow and 'Ati' means 'ardana ati', which
means to cause pain. What is present in 'Rta' or 'Ati' is Aarta. Raudra means
cruel intention. Its karma or what happens in it is Raudra. Dharma has been
explained earlier. What is associated with Dharma is Dharmya. What is associated
with the quality of purity is Shukla. This four-fold Dhyana is divided into two
parts, because it is of two types based on the difference between Prashsta and
Aprashsta. What causes the flow of Papa is Aprashsta, and what is capable of
burning karma is Prashsta. 8875. If you ask what that is, the next Sutra says:
Among them, the two Dhyanas, Para, i.e., the last ones, are the cause of Moksha.
||29|| 8876. Para means the last and the ultimate. The last one is Shukla
Dhyana. Because it is close to it, Dharmya Dhyana is also called Para. Since the
Sutra uses the dual form 'Pare', it also includes the secondary meaning. From
the statement 'Para, i.e., Dharmya and Shukla, are the cause of Moksha', it is
implied that the previous ones, i.e., Aarta and Raudra, are the cause of
Samsara. This is because there is no third objective besides Moksha and Samsara.
8877. Among them, Aarta Dhyana is of four types. To explain the characteristics
of the first type, the next Sutra says:

## 3521 **Sarvarthasiddhi** [9133 § 878 **The constant remembrance of something
unpleasant when it is present is the first type of *ārt* meditation.** ||30||
8878. *Amanōjña* means unpleasant. Poison, thorns, enemies, weapons, etc., are
called *amanōjña* because they cause harm. When they are present, the thought,
"How can they not be mine?" and the constant worry and planning about them is
called the first *ārt* meditation. 8879. To explain the characteristics of the
second type, the sūtra says: **The opposite of what is pleasant.** ||31|| 8880.
What is the opposite? It is what was said before. This means that when something
pleasant, such as one's son, wife, or wealth, is lost, the constant worry and
planning about getting it back is the second *ārt* meditation. 8881. To explain
the characteristics of the third type, the sūtra says: **And pain.** ||32||
8882. The word *vedanā* refers to both pleasure and pain, but here, because the
topic is *ārt* meditation, it refers to pain. When there is pain caused by wind,
etc., the thought, "How can this pain not be mine?" and the constant worry and
planning about getting rid of it is called the third *ārt* meditation. 8883. To
explain the characteristics of the fourth type, the sūtra says: **And the
cause.** ||33|| 8884. The constant worry and planning of a person who is eager
for enjoyment about getting things in the future

## Chapter Nine  [333] The fourth type of *ārt* meditation is called *nidāna*.
[885] If you ask who is the owner of this four-fold *ārt* meditation, then it is
said: It is found in *avirat*, *deśavirat*, and *pramattasamyata* beings. [34]
[8886] *Avirat* are those who are not restrained in their *samyagdṛṣṭi* (right
faith) and are not yet on the path of liberation. *Deśavirat* are those who are
restrained in their *samyagdṛṣṭi* but are not yet fully liberated.
*Pramattasamyata* are those who are engaged in actions with fifteen types of
*pramāda* (negligence). Among these, *avirat* and *deśavirat* experience all
four types of *ārt* meditation because they are affected by the consequences of
their unrestrained actions. *Pramattasamyata* beings, however, may experience
only *nidāna* and not the other three types of *ārt* meditation, because the
intensity of their *pramāda* is very high.  [8887] The *ārt* meditation has been
explained through its definition and other aspects. Now, to determine the
definition, cause, and owner of the second type of meditation, the next sūtra
says: Continuous contemplation on violence, falsehood, stealing, and sensual
pleasures is called *raudradhyāna*. It is found in *avirat* and *deśavirat*
beings. [35]  [8888] The characteristics of violence, etc., have been mentioned
earlier. They are the causes for the arising of *raudradhyāna*. This indicates
the cause. The word "memory-association" ( *smṛtisamanvāhāra* ) is connected to
these causes of violence, etc., because it follows the indication of the cause.
For example, "memory-association of violence", etc. This *raudradhyāna* should
be understood to be present in *avirat* and *deśavirat* beings.  **Doubt:** How
can *raudradhyāna* be present in *deśavirat* beings, when it is said to be
present in *avirat* beings?  **Resolution:** It is possible for *deśavirat*
beings to experience *raudradhyāna* as well, due to the influence of violence,
etc., or because they are dependent on wealth, etc., for their survival.
However, the *raudradhyāna* experienced by *deśavirat* beings is...

[354] **Sarvarthasiddhi** [9136 $ 889: The cause of Naraka and other bad
destinies is not there, because of the power of Samyagdarshan. But for the
restrained, it does not happen at all, because at its beginning, restraint falls
away. $ 889: It is said, "The two meditations are the cause of liberation."
There, the distinction, nature, and master of the first meditation, which is the
cause of liberation, should be indicated. Therefore, the next verse says -
Agyna, Apaya, Vipaka, and Sansthana, the contemplation of these is
Dharmyadhyana. ||36|| $ 890. Vichyana is Vichya. Vichya, Viveka, and Vicharana
are synonyms. The mutual duality of Agyna, Apaya, Vipaka, and Sansthana,
combined with the word Vichya, forms a Shashthitattpurusha compound, and thus
the word "Agynapaya Vipaka Sansthana Vichya" is formed. The word
"Smritisamanvaharah" is carried forward. And it is related to each one. For
example, Smritisamanvaharah for Agynavichya, etc. The explanation is as follows
- In the absence of the teacher, due to one's own dull intellect, due to the
rise of karma, and due to the subtlety of the objects, in the absence of reason
and illustration in support of the truth, by taking the Agam, which is ordained
by the Sarvagna, as evidence, "This is the way, because the Jinas are not
otherwise," thus, the determination of the meaning through faith in the profound
object is Agynavichya Dharmyadhyana. Or, knowing the truth of the objects
oneself, and wishing to teach it to others, the continuous contemplation of
reason, nay, and evidence, in order to support the truth without contradicting
one's own doctrine, is called Agynavichya, because it reveals the command of the
Sarvagna. Like a blind man born, Mithyadrishti beings are turned away from the
path ordained by the Sarvagna, they do not know the right path, and therefore
they abandon the seekers of liberation from afar. Thus, the contemplation of the
fall from the right path is Apaya Vichya Dharmyadhyana. Or, how will these
beings be freed from Mithyadarshan, Mithyagyan, and Mithyacharitra? This
continuous contemplation is Apaya Vichya Dharmyadhyana. The contemplation of
karma, such as Jnanavarana, etc., in terms of dravya, kshetra, kala, bhava,
bhava, pratyaya, phala, and anubhava, is... ]

## Chapter Nine:   **[355] Analysis of Karma Results:** This chapter discusses
the nature of the universe and its inhabitants, and how to cultivate
mindfulness. The nature of Dharma, characterized by qualities like supreme
forgiveness, has been explained. Therefore, one should understand the four types
of Dharma-based mindfulness, which are practiced by beings who are:   *
**Avirata:** Those who are constantly engaged in Dharma. * **Deshavirata:**
Those who are free from attachment to worldly things. * **Pramatta Samyata:**
Those who are mindful but still prone to distractions. * **Aprammatta Samyata:**
Those who are completely free from distractions and fully mindful.  **Dharma-
based mindfulness** is the conscious awareness of the karmic results experienced
due to the factors of substance, field, time, birth, and motivation. It also
involves the continuous contemplation of the nature and structure of the
universe.   **Dharma-based mindfulness** is a state of mind that arises from the
right understanding of the true nature of reality. It is characterized by
detachment from the world, the body, and worldly pleasures. This detachment is
cultivated through the practice of **Samyak Drishti** (right faith). Dharma-
based mindfulness is infused with the qualities of supreme forgiveness and other
virtues, hence the name.   **Four types of Dharma-based mindfulness:**  *
**Agyna Vichaya:** This type of mindfulness helps in understanding the true
nature of reality. * **Apay Vichaya:** This type of mindfulness helps in
developing detachment from the world, the body, and worldly pleasures. * **Vipak
Vichaya:** This type of mindfulness helps in understanding the intricacies of
karmic results and their causes. * **Sansthan Vichaya:** This type of
mindfulness helps in understanding the structure and functioning of the
universe.  **The nature of Vipak Vichaya:**  The discussion of karma results in
relation to substance, field, and time, as mentioned in the original commentary,
emphasizes that the ripening of karma, leading to the experience of various
bodies and states of being, does not occur in isolation. It requires the
presence of other factors, such as substance, field, etc.   **Example of
substance as a factor:**  Imagine a person who is happily playing with their
children. Suddenly, the roof of their house collapses, causing them injury and
pain. The collapse of the roof is the substance that triggers the experience of
pain. This pain is a result of the ripening of the karmic potential for
suffering, which is activated by the external factor of the collapsing roof.
**Time as a factor:**  Time plays a role in the ripening of karma in two ways:
1. **The specific time frame for the ripening of a particular karma:** For
example, the ripening of the karmic potential for happiness and pleasure
typically lasts for six months. After this period, the potential for suffering
and sorrow begins to ripen. 2. **The time frame within which the ripening of
karma can be altered:** If, within the six-month period, an event occurs that
contradicts the ripening of happiness and pleasure, the ripening process can be
altered.   **Example of time as a factor:**  Imagine a person who is traveling
fearlessly to a new land. However, they find themselves in a dangerous forest at
night, where there are wild animals and no safe place to rest. If it were
daytime, they would not be afraid. But because it is night, they experience
fear. This fear is a result of the ripening of the karmic potential for fear,
which is triggered by the external factor of night time.   **Conclusion:**  The
ripening of karma is a complex process that is influenced by various factors,
including substance, field, and time. Understanding these factors is crucial for
cultivating Dharma-based mindfulness and achieving liberation from the cycle of
birth and death.

## Translation:  **[356]**  **Sarvarthasiddhi**  [91368 890]  When **Asata**,
**Arati**, **Shoka** and **Bhaya** karmas begin to arise and be stimulated, it
is called **Kalanimittak** arising. Similarly, one should understand
**Kshetra**, **Bhava** and **Bhavanimittak** arising and stimulation. The
experience of **Kalaprapta** karma particles is called **Uday** (arising), and
bringing the karma particles located outside the **Udayavali** into the
**Udayavali** through a special **Virya** (energy) with or without **Kashaya**
(passions) and experiencing them along with the **Udayaprapta** karma particles
is called **Udirana** (stimulation). Thus, the experience of karma particles is
taken into account in both **Uday** and **Udirana**. If there is a difference
between them, it is between **Kalaprapta** and **Akalaprapta** particles.
**Uday** involves **Kalaprapta** karma particles, and **Udirana** involves
**Akalaprapta** karma particles. The general rule is that where the **Uday** of
a karma occurs, its **Udirana** must also occur. However, the specific
characteristics of each are described here:  * The **Uday** and **Udirana** of
**Mithyatva** occur in the **Mithyatva** Gunasthan. A special characteristic is
that in the final **Avalikaal** of a **Jiva** who is facing **Upshama**
**Samyaktva**, there is no **Udirana** of **Mithyatva**, only its **Uday**. *
The **Uday** and **Udirana** of **Ekendriya** jati, **Dwiindriya** jati,
**Triindriya** jati, **Chaturindriya** jati, **Atap**, **Sthavar**, **Sukshma**,
**Aparayapta** and **Sadharan** occur only in the **Mithyatva** Gunasthan, not
beyond. * The **Uday** and **Udirana** of **Anantanu bandhi** Chatushk occur in
the first two Gunasthanas, not beyond. * The **Uday** and **Udirana** of
**Samyamithyatva** occur only in the third Gunasthan, not elsewhere. * The
**Uday** and **Udirana** of **Apratyakhyan** Chatushk, **Narakagati**,
**Devagati**, **Vaikriyik** body, **Vaikriyik** limbs, **Durbhag**, **Anadeya**
and **Ayashaskiti** occur only up to the fourth Gunasthan, not beyond. * The
**Uday** and **Udirana** of **Narakay** and **Devayuk** occur only up to the
fourth Gunasthan, not beyond. Only at the time of death, in the final
**Avalikaal**, there is no **Udirana**. * The **Uday** and **Udirana** of the
four **Anupurvi** occur only in the first, second and fourth Gunasthanas, not
elsewhere. * The **Uday** and **Udirana** of **Pratyakhyanavaran** Chatushk,
**Tiryanchgati**, **Udyot** and **Nichegotra** occur only up to the **Sanyata**
**Sanyat** Gunasthan, not beyond. * The **Uday** and **Udirana** of **Tiryanch**
Ayuk occur only up to the fifth Gunasthan. Only at the time of death, if the
final **Avalikaal** remains, there is only **Uday**, no **Udirana**. * The
**Uday** and **Udirana** of **Nidranidra**, **Prachalaprachala**,
**Styanagridhi**, **Satavedaniya** and **Asatavedaniya** occur only up to the
sixth Gunasthan, not beyond. Only those who have achieved complete **Indriya**
**Parayapti** can stimulate **Nidranidra** etc. If such a **Jiva** undergoes
**Uttara** body transformation or receives **Aharakasamudghat**, then from one
**Avalikaal** before receiving them until entering the original body, there is
no **Udirana** of these three. Similarly, **Deva**, **Naraki** and
**Bhogabhumis** **Jivas** also do not stimulate these three. * The **Udirana**
and **Uday** of **Aharak** body and **Aharak** limbs occur only in
**Pramattasanyat**, not before or after. * The **Udirana** of **Manushy** Ayuk
occurs up to the sixth Gunasthan, and its **Uday** occurs up to the fourteenth
Gunasthan. Only at the time of death, if the final **Avalikaal** remains, there
is no **Udirana**. * The **Udirana** and **Uday** of **Samyaktva** nature occur
from the fourth to the seventh Gunasthan for **Vedakasamyagdristi**. Only in the
time of **Kritakritya** **Vedak** and in the **Utpasi** time of
**Dvitiyopshama** **Samyaktva**, when one **Avalikaal** remains, there is only
**Uday**, no **Udirana**. * The **Udirana** and **Uday** of the final three
**Sanhanan** occur only up to the seventh Gunasthan. * The **Udirana** and
**Uday** of **Hasya** etc. six occur only up to the eighth Gunasthan. A special
characteristic is that from the time of the birth of **Devas** until the
**Antarmuhurt** time, **Hasya** and **Rati** are stimulated regularly, and
beyond that, it is optional.

## Chapter Nine  **The Explanation of the Three Meditations**  The explanation
of the three meditations has been given. Now, the white meditation should be
explained. It has four variations, which will be discussed. The first two
variations are for the masters, and this is said for their identification:
**The first two white meditations belong to the **Shruta Kevali** (those who
have perfect knowledge of the scriptures).**  The word "cha" (and) in the sutra
includes the righteous meditation. According to the rule, "special knowledge is
obtained through explanation," righteous meditation occurs before ascending the
ladder of knowledge, and the first two white meditations occur on both ladders.
This is how it should be explained.  **The remaining two white meditations
belong to the **Kevali** (those who have perfect knowledge).**  The arousal and
arising of the three passions (anger, greed, and delusion) and the three fires
(anger, greed, and delusion) occur only until the penultimate part of the ninth
stage of knowledge. They do not occur beyond that. This is a special feature:
whoever ascends the ladder of knowledge due to the arising of a particular
passion, does not experience its arousal in the first stage when one **avali
kala** (a very short period of time) remains.  The arousal and arising of the
passion of greed occur until the tenth stage of knowledge. It does not
experience arousal, but arises when only one **avali kala** remains in the last
stage of the tenth stage of knowledge.  The arousal and arising of the
**vajranaracha** (a type of hell) and **naracha** (a type of hell) occur until
the eleventh stage of knowledge.  Sleep and **prachalaki** (a type of hell) both
arise and experience arousal until one **avali kala** remains in the twelfth
stage of knowledge. Beyond that, they only arise until the penultimate part of
the twelfth stage of knowledge.  The five knowledge-obscurations, four vision-
obscurations, and five hindrances, these fourteen karmas, arise until the last
stage of the twelfth stage of knowledge, and experience arousal until one
**avali kala** remains in the twelfth stage of knowledge.  The human state, the
five-sense beings, the **oudarika** (a type of body), the **taijas** (a type of
body), and the **karman** (a type of body), the six substances, the **oudarika**
limbs, the **vajravrishabhanaracha** (a type of hell), the four categories
(color, etc.), the **aguru** (heavy), the **laghu** (light), the **upghat** (a
type of hell), the **ucchavas** (a type of hell), the two **vihayoga** (a type
of hell), the **bas** (a type of hell), the **badar** (a type of hell), the
**paryapt** (a type of hell), each body, the stable, the unstable, the
auspicious, the inauspicious, the beautiful, the melodious, the discordant, the
**adeya** (a type of hell), the **yashkirti** (a type of hell), the **nirman**
(a type of hell), and the **uchchagotra** (a type of hell), these thirty-eight
karmas experience arousal and arise until the thirteenth stage of knowledge.
They do not occur beyond that.  The **tirthankara** (a liberated being) karma
experiences arousal and arises only in the thirteenth stage of knowledge.  Thus,
constantly thinking about the **ajna** (command) and other things is righteous
meditation. This is the meaning of the above statement.

358] In the attainment of all auspiciousness, [91406 894 8894. There are two
types of *śukladhyāna* for the *kevali* with *sayoga* and *ayoga*, respectively,
at the end. 8 895. To explain these types in detail, the following *sūtra* is
uttered: *Pṛthaktva-vitarka*, *ekatva-vitarka*, *sūkṣma-kriyā-pratipāti*, and
*vyupara-kriyā-nivṛtti* are the four types of *śukladhyāna*. ||39|| 8896.
*Pṛthaktva-vitarka*, *ekatva-vitarka*, *sūkṣma-kriyā-pratipāti*, and *vyupara-
kriyā-nivṛtti* are the four types of *śukladhyāna*. The meaning of each should
be understood in relation to the characteristics that will be explained later. 8
897. To determine the specific object of these, the following *sūtra* is
uttered: They are of three *yoga*, one *yoga*, *kāya-yoga*, and *ayoga*,
respectively. ||40|| 8 898. The word "yoga" has been explained in the *sūtra* "
*kāya-vāṅ-manaḥ-karma yoga*". The relationship between the four types of
*śukladhyāna* and the four terms, *triyoga* etc., should be understood in order.
*Pṛthaktva-vitarka* is for the three *yoga*. *Ekatva-vitarka* is for the one
*yoga* among the three *yoga*. *Sūkṣma-kriyā-pratipāti* is for *kāya-yoga*. And
*vyupara-kriyā-nivṛtti* is for *ayoga*. 8 899. To explain the specific
understanding of the first two, the following *sūtra* is uttered: The first two
*dhyāna* are with one *āśraya*, *savitarka*, and *savicāra*. ||41|| 8 900. Those
two *dhyāna* which have one *āśraya* are called those with one *āśraya*. These
two *dhyāna* are begun by one who has attained complete *śruta-jñāna*. This is
stated in 1. *kṣaṇam-upeya sarve* (Mu.) || 2. *manvārtham-ava* (Mu.) || 3.
*ubhaye 'pi* (Ā. Di. 1, Di. 2, Nā.) ||

-9144 5906] Ninth Chapter [359 This is the meaning.  Vitaraka and Vicara are
Vitaraka-Vicara, and those who dwell with Vitaraka-Vicara are Savitaraka-Vicara.
The previous [sutra] means separate and unified Vitaraka.  8901.  There, in the
context of the sequence, this is said for the sake of the cessation of the
undesirable: The second is A-Vicara.  ||42|| 8902.  The second of the previous
two [dhyanas] should be understood as A-Vicara.  This is said:  The first is
Savitaraka and Savicara.  The second is Savitaraka and A-Vicara.  8903.  Now,
what is the difference between Vitaraka and Vicara?  This is said: Vitaraka is
the heard.  ||43|| 8904.  Specifically, reasoning and inference is Vitaraka,
meaning heard knowledge.  8905.  Now, what is Vicara? Vicara is the transition
of the meaning, expression, and yoga.  ||44|| 8906.  Meaning is the object,
which is the substance or the synonym.  Expression is the word.  Yoga is the
characteristic of the action of the body, speech, and mind.  Transition is
change.  Leaving the substance, one attains the synonym, and leaving the
synonym, one attains the substance - this is the transition of meaning.  Taking
hold of one heard word, one takes hold of another word, and leaving that, one
takes hold of another - this is the transition of expression.  Leaving the body
yoga, one takes hold of another yoga, and leaving that yoga, one takes hold of
the body yoga - this is the transition of yoga.  Thus, this change is called
Vicara.  This is the fourfold dhyana, which is specified by the general and the
specific, and is white, and is the statement of the many kinds of upaya, such as
the previously mentioned secret, etc., and its meaning.  Those who dwell with
Vitaraka and Vicara are called Savitaraka-Vicara dhyana.  The previous [sutra]
means separate and unified Vitaraka. 8901.  In the context of the sequence in
the previous [sutra], for the sake of the cessation of the undesirable meaning,
the next [sutra] is said: The second dhyana is A-Vicara.  ||42|| 6902.  The
second dhyana of the previous two dhyanas should be understood as A-Vicara.  The
meaning is that the first white dhyana is Savitaraka and Savicara, and the
second white dhyana is Savitaraka and A-Vicara. 6903.  Now, to show the
difference between Vitaraka and Vicara, the next [sutra] is said: The meaning of
Vitaraka is the heard.  ||43|| 8904.  Specifically, reasoning and inference is
Vitaraka, meaning heard knowledge.  8905.  Now, what is Vicara?  This is said by
the next [sutra]:  The transition of meaning, expression, and yoga is Vicara.
||44|| 8906.  Meaning is the object.  From this, substance and synonym are
taken.  The meaning of expression is word, and the action of the body, speech,
and mind is called yoga.  The meaning of transition is change.  Leaving the
substance, one attains the synonym, and leaving the synonym, one attains the
substance - this is the transition of meaning.  Taking hold of one heard word,
one takes hold of another word, and leaving that, one takes hold of another -
this is the transition of expression.  Leaving the body yoga, one takes hold of
another yoga, and leaving that yoga, one takes hold of the body yoga - this is
the transition of yoga.  Thus, this change is called Vicara.  This is the
fourfold dhyana, which is specified by the general and the specific, and is
white, and is the statement of the many kinds of upaya, such as the previously
mentioned secret, etc., and its meaning.

[360] Sarvarthasiddhau 191445906   A Muni who has performed all the necessary
actions is worthy of meditation for the cessation of worldly existence. There,
meditating on the dravya-paramāṇu or the bhāva-paramāṇu is not the point. The
vitarka-sāmaya is the transition of the mind in the form of meaning and
expression, body and speech, separately.  The mind, being insufficient, like a
child with excessive enthusiasm, unstable and unrefined, even with a weapon,
cuts through the nature of delusion slowly, pacifying and destroying it. This is
the vitarka-vīcara-dhyāna.  The same Muni, desiring to burn the root of
delusion, relying on the special purity of infinite virtues, prevents the
bondage of many natures that are supportive of the knowledge-obscuring karma,
reduces and destroys the state of karma, and is endowed with the use of śruta-
jñāna, free from the transition of meaning, expression, and yoga, with a steady
mind, with diminished kṣaya, like a vaidūrya gem, free from impurities,
meditates and does not return. This is called the ekattva-vitarka-dhyāna.  Thus,
the ekattva-vitarka śukla-dhyāna, like a fire that has burned the four ghatiya
karma as fuel, whose rays of pure knowledge are illuminated, shining like the
sun that has emerged from the obstruction of the cloud, such a Bhagavān,
Tīrthankara, Kevali, or ordinary Kevali, is worthy of being approached and
worshipped by the Indras, and dwells in the world for a period of time slightly
less than a previous koti. When he has only an antarmukha-muhurta of life
remaining, and the state of vedaniya, nāma, and gotra karma is equal to the
remaining āyu-karma, then he abandons all types of vāc-yoga, mano-yoga, and
bāhu-kāya-yoga, and embracing the sūṣma-kāya-yoga, accepts the sūṣma-kriyā-
pratipāti-dhyāna. But when those sāyogī, who have only an antarmukha-muhurta of
life remaining, and the state of the remaining three karmas is greater than
that, then those who have attained the atiśaya of ātmopāyoga, who have the
support of samāyika, who are endowed with special causes, who are performing the
mahā-samvara, who are digesting the laghu-karma, who are free from transition,
are called vīcara. This type of transformation is called vīcara.  This fourfold
dharmya-dhyāna and śukla-dhyāna, described in general and specific terms, when
combined with many methods such as gupti, etc., is worthy of meditation for the
destruction of the world by a Muni who has performed all the necessary actions
properly. Just as a child with insufficient enthusiasm, unstable and with a
blunt weapon, pierces the chest over a long period of time, so too, one who has
attained the power of the mind, meditating on the dravya-paramāṇu and the bhāva-
paramāṇu, pacifies and destroys the nature of the delusion-inducing karma,
through the mind that transitions separately in meaning and expression, body and
speech. This is the vitarka-vīcara-dhyāna. Again, one who desires to burn the
root of delusion-inducing karma, who has attained the special purity of infinite
virtues, who prevents the bondage of many natures that are supportive of the
knowledge-obscuring karma, who reduces and destroys the state of karma, who is
endowed with the use of śruta-jñāna, who is free from the transition of meaning,
expression, and yoga, with a steady mind, with diminished kṣaya, like a vaidūrya
gem, free from impurities, meditates and does not return. This is called the
ekattva-vitarka-dhyāna. Thus, the ekattva-vitarka śukla-dhyāna, like a fire that
has burned the four ghatiya karma as fuel, whose rays of pure knowledge are
illuminated, shining like the sun that has emerged from the obstruction of the
cloud, such a Bhagavān, Tīrthankara, Kevali, or ordinary Kevali, is worthy of
being approached and worshipped by the Indras, and dwells in the world for a
period of time slightly less than a previous koti. When he has only an
antarmukha-muhurta of life remaining, and the state of vedaniya, nāma, and gotra
karma is equal to the remaining āyu-karma, then he abandons all types of vāc-

the sūṣma-kriyā-pratipāti-dhyāna. But when those sāyogī, who have only an
antarmukha-muhurta of life remaining, and the state of the remaining three
karmas is greater than that, then those who have attained the atiśaya of
ātmopāyoga, who have the support of samāyika, who are endowed with special
causes, who are performing the mahā-samvara, who are digesting the laghu-karma,
who are free from transition, are called vīcara. This type of transformation is
called vīcara.

## Chapter Nine  **1361**  By the power of their inherent ability to destroy the
particles of remaining karma, they purify the four types of karma - danda,
kapaṭa, pratar, and lokapūraṇa - by spreading out their soul-regions for four
periods of time. Then, by contracting their soul-regions for the same four
periods of time, they equalize the remaining four types of karma. Having
attained the size of their previous body, they engage in subtle actions through
the subtle body yoga and practice the subtle action contemplation. After that,
they begin the fourth contemplation, the contemplation of cessation of actions.
This is called the contemplation of cessation of actions because it involves the
cessation of the actions of the in-breath and out-breath, and the cessation of
all actions of the body, speech, and mind, as well as the cessation of the
pulsation of the soul-regions. In this contemplation of cessation of actions,
the complete cessation of the influx of all karmic bonds and the destruction of
all remaining karma occurs. This gives rise to the complete, perfect, and well-
known conduct, knowledge, and insight of the non-liberated omniscient, which is
the direct cause of liberation, leading to the severance of all the
entanglements of the cycle of birth and death. Then, the non-liberated
omniscient, the Lord, attains liberation, having burned away all impurities,
stains, and karmic bonds by the fire of the intensity of his contemplation, and
having destroyed the impurities of the metals, stones, and jewels, and attained
a pure, golden soul. This is a two-fold austerity, as it is the cause of
restraint due to its being the cause of the cessation of the influx of new
karma, and it is also the cause of liberation due to its being the cause of the
destruction of the residue of past karma.  **8907** Here it is said: "Are all
right-believers equally liberated, or is there some difference?" To answer this,
the next aphorism says:  _Right-believers, hearers, restrained, those who have
severed the infinite attachments, those who have destroyed the doubts of
insight, those who have calmed the passions, those who have attained peace of
mind, those who have destroyed the doubts, those who have weakened the doubts,
and those who have conquered the doubts - these are liberated in countless
degrees._ **45**  **8908** These ten, right-believers, etc., are liberated in
countless degrees. For example, the future omniscient, the one who has five
senses, the one who has attained perfection, the one who has obtained the
aforementioned time-limit, etc., the one who is growing by the purification of
his transformations, the one who is gradually performing the actions of the
past, etc., and the one who is experiencing the ripening of karma in a small
amount - these are all liberated in countless degrees.

**darshan mohaniya** (karma that hinders knowledge) of **trirupa** (three
forms), becomes **darshan moha kshapaka** (one who destroys the karma that
hinders knowledge) due to the **atishya** (excess) of **vishuddhi** (purity) of
**parinama** (result) and becomes **asankhyeya guna nirjara** as mentioned
before. Thus, he becomes **kshayika samyagdristi** (one who has destroyed the
karma that hinders right faith) and, while striving towards **shreshya arohana**
(ascending the highest stage) and **charitra moha upasama** (cessation of karma
that hinders conduct), he experiences **upasamaka** (one who destroys) due to
the **prakarhsa** (excellence) of **vishuddhi** (purity) and becomes
**asankhyeya guna nirjara** as mentioned before. The same **jiva**, upon
attaining the **nimitta** (cause) for **charitra moha upasama** (cessation of
karma that hinders conduct), becomes **upashanta kshaya** (one who has destroyed
the karma that hinders conduct) and becomes **asankhyeya guna nirjara** as
mentioned before. The same **jiva**, while striving towards **charitra moha
kshapana** (destruction of karma that hinders conduct) and increasing
**vishuddhi** (purity) of **parinama** (result), experiences **kshapaka** (one
who destroys) and becomes **asankhyeya guna nirjara** as mentioned before. The
same **jiva**, while striving towards **parinama** (result) of **kshayana**
(destruction) of **charitra moha kshapana** (destruction of karma that hinders
conduct), becomes **kshina kshaya** (one who has destroyed the karma that
hinders conduct) and becomes **asankhyeya guna nirjara** as mentioned before.
The same **jiva**, upon destroying the **ghatikarma** (destructive karma) by the
fire of **dvitiya shukla dhyana** (second white meditation), becomes **jina**
(conqueror) and becomes **asankhyeya guna nirjara** as mentioned before.

-9146 8 910] Chapter Nine [363 5909. It is said, even in the presence of right
faith, if due to the exhaustion of the qualities, they are not equal to each
other, then are the Shravakas, Viratas, etc., not liberated due to the
difference in qualities? It is said, this is not so. Why? Because, even though
there is a difference due to the difference in qualities, due to the operation
of the Nayas like Negation, etc., all of them are Pulaka, Bakusha, Kushil,
Nirgrantha and Snataka, these are the five Nirgranthas. ||46|| 8910. Those whose
minds are devoid of the contemplation of the higher qualities, who do not attain
perfection even in the vows, are called Pulakas, because they are like the
impure Pulaka (withered grain). Those who are Nirgranthas, who observe the vows
without interruption, who are engaged in enhancing the beauty of their body and
instruments, who are surrounded by family and are filled with various kinds of
delusion, are called Bakushas. Here, the word Bakusha is a synonym for the word
'Shabala' (multicolored). Kushilas are of two types - Pratiseshana Kushil and
Kshaya Kushil. Those who are surrounded by possessions, who are perfect in both
the primary and higher qualities, but sometimes contradict the higher qualities,
are called Pratiseshana Kushilas. Those who have conquered the rise of other
passions and who are only subject to the burning passion, are called Kshaya
Kushilas. Just as in water, a wooden 1.- भावनोपेत  मु.। 2. शुद्धा: पुलाक- मु.।

## Chapter Nine  Kushila, while not contradicting the fundamental virtues,
contradicts some of the secondary virtues. There is no contradiction for those
who have shed the bonds of passions, Kushila, Nirgrantha, and Snataka.  8915.
All Nirgranthas are Tirthas in the Tirthas of all Tirthankaras.  8916. Linga is
of two types: Dravyalinga and Bhavalinga. All five Nirgranthas are Lingins with
respect to Bhavalinga. They are differentiated with respect to Dravyalinga,
which refers to their physical characteristics like height, color, and hair.
8917. Leshya: Pulaka has three Leshyas ahead of it. Bakush and Pratiseshana-
Kushila have six Leshyas each. Kashayakushila has four Leshyas at the end.
Sukshmasampray, Kashayakushila, Nirgrantha, and Snataka have only the white
Leshya. A yogi has no Leshya.  8918. Upapad: Pulaka's highest Upapad is in the
Sahasrar Kalpa, among the Devas who reside in the highest state. Bakush and
Pratiseshana-Kushila's highest Upapad is in the Aran and Achyut Kalpas, among
the Devas who reside in the state of twenty-two Sagaropama. Kashayakushila and
Nirgrantha's highest Upapad is in the Sarvarthasiddhi, among the Devas who
reside in the state of thirty-three Sagaropama. The lowest Upapad for all of
them is in the Saudharma Kalpa, among the Devas who reside in the state of two
Sagaropama. And the Snataka attains liberation.  8919. Sthan: There are
countless Sanyamasthans caused by passions. The lowest Labdhisthans are for
Pulaka and Kashayakushila. They both go through countless Sthans together. After
that, Pulaka's Vyuchchitti happens. Then, Kashayakushila goes through countless
Sthans alone. After that, Kashayakushila, Pratiseshana-Kushila, and Bakush go
through countless Sthans together. Here, Bakush's Vyuchchitti happens. After
that, they go through countless Sthans together.   1. षडपि ।
कृष्णलेश्यादित्रितयं तयोः कथमिति चेदुच्यते—तयोरुपक रणासक्तिसंभवादार्तध्यानं

षडपि । How do they have three Leshyas, including the black Leshya? It is said
that because of their involvement in the battle of the senses, they may
sometimes experience Artadhyana. And through Artadhyana, the three Leshyas,
including the black Leshya, are possible. Kashay - Mu.

## Chapter Ten: The End  $920.$ It is said that the time has come to explain the
nature of liberation, which was mentioned at the end. This is true. Liberation
is attained only after the attainment of perfect knowledge. Therefore, the
causes of the arising of perfect knowledge are stated in the following sutra:
**From the destruction of delusion, and the destruction of knowledge-obscuring,
sight-obscuring, and karmic obstructions, perfect knowledge arises.** ||1||
$8921.$ It is appropriate to condense this sutra. Why? Because it makes the
sutra shorter. How? By not using the word "destruction" separately, and by not
using the word "and" due to the absence of a different case ending, the sutra
becomes shorter, as in "From the destruction of delusion, knowledge-obscuring,
sight-obscuring, and karmic obstructions, perfect knowledge arises." This is
true, but the order of destruction is indicated by using different sentences.
First, by destroying delusion and attaining the designation of "diminished
karmas" for a very short time, then by simultaneously destroying knowledge-
obscuring, sight-obscuring, and karmic obstructions, one attains perfect
knowledge. The destruction of these karmas is the cause of the arising of
perfect knowledge. Therefore, the case ending indicating the "cause" is used.
**Question:** How is the destruction of delusion attained first?   **Answer:** A
future perfect being, who is growing in purity of results, having attained the
state of un-controlled perfect vision, attains the destruction of the seven
types of delusion in one of the four states of controlled-uncontrolled, deluded-
controlled, and non-deluded-controlled. Having become a "karmic" perfect being,
he becomes inclined to ascend the ladder of "karmic destroyers" and attains the
state of non-deluded-controlled. By the application of the "unprecedented
action," he experiences the designation of the "unprecedented action-karmic
destroyer" state. There, he experiences the diminishing of the state and parts
of the karmic nature of sins due to the purity of new results, and the increase
of the parts of the experience of virtuous actions. By attaining the "non-
reversal action," he attains the state of "non-reversal-karmic destroyer."

3681 Sarvarthasiddhi [912 8 922 - By ascending the Saṃpārāya Kṣapaka Guṇasthāna,
destroying the eight Kṣayās there, eliminating the Napumsaka Veda and the Strī
Veda in succession, destroying the six No-Kṣayās by transferring them to the
Puruṣa Veda, and then destroying the Puruṣa Veda by transferring it to Krodha
Saṃjvalana, Krodha Saṃjvalana to Māna Saṃjvalana, Māna Saṃjvalana to Māyā
Saṃjvalana, and Māyā Saṃjvalana to Lobha Saṃjvalana in succession through the
Bādarakṛṣṭi Vibhāga, and then by making Lobha Saṃjvalana thin, experiencing the
subtle Saṃpārāya Kṣapakatva, destroying all that is Mohaniya, destroying the
Kṣayās completely, ascending to the Kṣīṇa Kṣayā Guṇasthāna, shedding the burden
of the Mohaniya, and destroying Nidrā and Pracala in the penultimate stage of
the Kṣīṇa Kṣayā Guṇasthāna, and finally destroying the five Jñāna Avaraṇas, the
four Darśana Avaraṇas, and the five Antarāyas, one attains the Kevala Paryāya,
which is the special state of the nature of Jñāna and Darśana, which is Avitarya
Vibhūti.] 8922. It is said, "From what cause is liberation attained, and what is
its characteristic?" This is explained in the following sūtra: "Liberation is
the complete destruction of all karmas due to the absence of the causes of
bondage and their destruction." ||2|| 8923. The absence of the causes, such as
Mithyādarśana, leads to the absence of new karmas, and the destruction of the
unconquered karmas occurs due to the presence of the cause of destruction
mentioned earlier. The phrase "Bandha Hetvabhāva Nirjarābhyām" indicates the
division based on the cause. Therefore, one should understand that liberation is
the simultaneous and complete destruction of all karmas, which are the remaining
karmas that have been equated with the cause of existence. There are two types
of absence of karma: attainable by effort and unattainable by effort. Of these,
the absence of Naraka Ayu, Tiryanca Ayu, and Deva Ayu in the case of the final
body is not attainable by effort, because their existence is not available in
the final body. What is attainable by effort is mentioned further. In the four
Guṇasthānas, starting from Asamya Samyagdṛṣṭi, in one of the Guṇasthānas,

## 370] Sarvarthasiddhi  [1013 6 924$ 924. It is said, "Does liberation occur
only from the elimination of the pudgalik dravyakarma prakritis, or also from
the elimination of the bhavakarma?" This is explained in the following sutra:
And from the absence of the bhavas like auspiciousness, etc., and bhavya-tva.
||3|| $ 925. What happens? "Liberation" is understood. The inclusion of bhavya-
tva is for the purpose of negating other parinaamik bhavas. Thus, it is accepted
that liberation occurs from the absence of bhavya-tva and auspiciousness, etc.,
among the parinaamik bhavas. 8926. It is said, "If liberation is promised from
the cessation of bhavas, then, similar to the cessation of auspiciousness, etc.,
bhavas, the cessation of all kshayik bhavas would be attained by the liberated
being." This would be the case if no distinction were mentioned. But there is a
distinction here, and to establish this exception, the following sutra is said:
Except for kevala-samyak-tva, kevala-jnana, kevala-darshan, and siddha-tva.
||3|| 8927. The word "anyatra" (except) is used in the fifth case. This rule
applies to other bhavas except for kevala-samyak-tva, kevala-jnana, kevala-
darshan, and siddha-tva. If only these four bhavas remain for the anka-siddhas,
then the cessation of ananta-virya, etc., would be attained? There is no fault,
because some have it and some don't. Except for these, the existence of the
remaining prakritis is by rule. This jiva, through the guna-sthana-krama,
eliminates the causes of bondage, and therefore, there is a gradual elimination
of new bondage. And, due to the special kind of transformation of the ancient
prakritis that are present in existence, there is a gradual decrease in the
karmas that are present in existence. Thus, due to the complete separation of
all karmas from bondage, this jiva becomes liberated. Here, the word "moksha"
(liberation) is used in the sense of the separation of karma, nokarma, and
bhavakarma. A samsari jiva is bound, and therefore, he is dependent on
something. When his bondage is broken, he becomes liberated, i.e., he attains
his own independence. Thus, the nature of liberation is explained. 8924. It is
said, "Does liberation occur only from the elimination of these pudgalik
dravyakarma prakritis, or also from the elimination of the bhavakarma?" To
explain this, the following sutra is said: And from the absence of the bhavas

~1016 8 931] Chapter Ten 1371. There is no difference between infinite power,
etc., because they are inseparable from knowledge and perception.  A being
without infinite power cannot have infinite knowledge, and happiness is
knowledge-like.   Objection:  Since liberated beings are formless, they do not
exist. Solution:  They have a form in their past and future bodies. 8928.
Objection:  If the soul is shaped by the body, then when the body is absent, the
soul will naturally expand to the size of the space of the world, and thus it
will become infinite. Solution:  This is not a fault.  Why?  Because there is no
cause.  The connection with name-karma is the cause of contraction and
expansion.  Since there is no connection with name-karma, there is no
contraction or expansion. 8929. Objection:  If there is no contraction or
expansion due to the absence of a cause, then just as there is no movement
downwards or sideways due to the absence of a cause of movement, there will also
be no upward movement.  Therefore, the liberated soul will remain in the same
place where it is liberated. Solution:  This is addressed in the following
sutra: The liberated soul goes upwards to the end of the world. ||5|| 8930.
After that.  Whose?  Of the one who has been liberated from all karma.  The word
"aṅ" in the sutra is used in the sense of "command".  The liberated soul goes
upwards to the end of the world. 8931. Objection:  How can we be certain of this
upward movement, since no cause has been given? Solution:  This is addressed in
the following sutra: The liberated soul goes upwards due to past experience, the
absence of attachment, the breaking of bondage, and the nature of such movement.
||6|| 1.  Because it is synonymous with knowledge, Mu., Ta.  2.  Past and future
bodies, Mu.  3.  The connection with karma, Ta.

[372] Sarvarthasiddhi [1017 § 932 8932. It is said that even a *pushkala*
(abundant) is not capable of achieving the intended meaning without the support
of an example, therefore the next *sutra* says: Like a potter's wheel that has
been spun, like a gourd freed from its coating, like a castor seed, and like a
flame of fire. || 7 || 8933. There is a sequential connection between the *hetu*
(reasons) mentioned in the previous *sutra* and the examples mentioned in this
*sutra*. For example, the rotation of the potter's wheel is caused by the
combined effort of the hand, the rod, and the wheel. Even after it stops, it
continues to rotate due to the residual effect of the previous action.
Similarly, the liberated soul, even in the absence of the many vows it has taken
to attain liberation, continues to move upwards due to the influence of those
vows. Moreover, this is due to its non-attachment. Just as a gourd, burdened by
the weight of the clay coating, sinks in water, but when the clay coating
loosens due to the water, it quickly rises to the surface, similarly, the soul,
burdened by the weight of karma, moves erratically in the world due to its
attachment to it, but when it is freed from that attachment, it rises upwards.
Moreover, this is due to the breaking of the bonds. Just as the castor seed
rises upwards when the bond of the seed pod is broken, similarly, the liberated
soul, freed from the bonds of all karma, including the names of birth and caste,
rises upwards. Moreover, this is due to the nature of its upward movement. Just
as a flame of fire, naturally inclined to move upwards, rises upwards due to its
connection with the wind, similarly, the liberated soul, free from the karma
that causes the various forms of movement, rises upwards due to its inherent
nature of upward movement. 8934. It is said that if the liberated soul is
naturally inclined to move upwards, why does it not rise above the *loka*
(world)? The next *sutra* answers this question.

## Chapter Ten  [373 The absence of Dharma-astikaya] ||8|| 6 935. Dharma-
astikaya, the cause of the attainment of motion, is not present in the liberated
soul, therefore there is no movement beyond the Lokanta. In the absence of that,
the absence of the division of Lok and Alok is implied.  8936. It is said that
these liberated souls, due to the absence of the causes of motion, birth, etc.,
are devoid of any distinction. However, there is some distinction, because the
liberated souls can be classified based on: * Kshetra (region) * Kala (time) *
Gati (motion) * Linga (gender) * Tirtha (pilgrimage) * Charitra (conduct) *
Pratyekabuddha (self-enlightened) * Bodhitabuddha (enlightened by another) *
Jnana (knowledge) * Avagahana (understanding) * Antara (difference) * Sankhya
(number) * Alp-bahutva (fewness-manyness) ||9||  8937. The liberated souls are
classified based on these thirteen Anuyoga (principles), which are considered as
Sadhya (achievable) and Vikalpya (optional). This classification is based on the
two Nayas (perspectives) of Anugraha (grace) for the present and the past. For
example, with respect to Kshetra (region), in which region do they attain
liberation? According to the perspective of the present, liberation is attained
in the Siddhi-Kshetra (region of liberation), in one's own region, or in the
region of space. According to the perspective of the past, with respect to
birth, liberation is attained in the fifteen Karma-bhumis (regions of action),
and with respect to the end of the cycle of births and deaths, liberation is
attained in the Manushya-Kshetra (human region). With respect to Kala (time), in
which time is liberation attained? According to the perspective of the present,
one attains liberation while being in the state of liberation. According to the
perspective of the past, with respect to birth, one attains liberation when born
in the Utsarpini (ascending) or Avasarpini (descending) time cycle.
Specifically, in the Avasarpini time cycle, one attains liberation when born in
the last part of the Sushma (prosperity) or the Dushama (adversity) period, or
when born in the Dushama-Sushma (adversity-prosperity) period. One does not
attain liberation when born in the Dushama (adversity) period. And one does not
attain liberation in any other time period. With respect to the end of the cycle
of births and deaths, one attains liberation in all the time periods of the
Utsarpini and Avasarpini. With respect to Gati (motion), in which motion is
liberation attained? Liberation is attained in the Siddhi-Gati (motion of
liberation) or the Manushya-Gati (human motion). With respect to Linga (gender),
in which gender... 1.  These thirteen... Ta., Na. 2. With respect to birth,
fifteen Karma... Mu.

[374] **How is omniscience attained?**  **By what means is omniscience
attained?**  Omniscience is attained through the three Vedas, but not in a
material sense, rather in a spiritual sense. In a material sense, it is attained
through the masculine gender. Alternatively, it is attained through the non-
scriptural gender. In the context of past lives, it is attained through the
scriptural gender.  **By what means is omniscience attained through a
Tirthankara?**  There are two types of omniscience attained through a
Tirthankara: omniscience attained through a Tirthankara and omniscience attained
through others. There are two types of others: those who attain omniscience in
the presence of a Tirthankara and those who attain omniscience in the absence of
a Tirthankara.  **By what means is omniscience attained through conduct?**
Omniscience is attained through conduct that is nameless or through conduct that
is of one, four, or five types.  **By what means is omniscience attained through
knowledge?**  Omniscience is attained through one, two, three, or four types of
knowledge.  **What is the meaning of "avagahana"?**  "Avagahana" refers to the
state of being pervasively present in one's own space. There are two types of
"avagahana": inferior and superior. Superior "avagahana" is five hundred and
twenty-five dhanus, while inferior "avagahana" is slightly less than three and a
half aratnis. There are many variations in between. Omniscience is attained
through any one type of "avagahana".  **What is the difference between those who
have attained omniscience?**  The difference between those who have attained
omniscience is that the inferior difference is two times, while the superior
difference is eight times. The inferior difference is one time, while the
superior difference is six months.  **What is the number of those who attain
omniscience?**  The number of those who attain omniscience is one in one time
for the inferior and one hundred and eight in one time for the superior.  **What
is the meaning of "alp bahutva"?**  "Alp bahutva" refers to the difference in
the number of those who have attained omniscience in relation to the different
types of realms, etc. For example, in the context of the present time, there is
no difference in the number of those who attain omniscience in the realm of
omniscience. However, in the context of past lives, there are two types of those
who attain omniscience in the realm: those who are born with omniscience and
those who attain omniscience through liberation. Of these, those who attain
omniscience through liberation are the fewest. Those who are born with
omniscience are many times more numerous.  **What are the different types of
realms?**  The different types of realms are: the realm of karma, the realm of
non-karma, the ocean, the island, the upper realm, the lower realm, and the
realm of the animals. Of these, those who attain omniscience in the upper realm
are the fewest. Those who attain omniscience in the lower realm are many times
more numerous. Those who attain omniscience in the realm of the animals are many
times more numerous. Those who attain omniscience in the ocean are the fewest.
Those who attain omniscience in the island are many times more numerous.  **What
is the meaning of "sarvatah stoka"?**  "Sarvatah stoka" refers to those who
attain omniscience in the realm of salt water. Those who attain omniscience in
the realm of time are many times more numerous.

## Chapter 10  [375]  **Qualities.** The Siddhas of Jambudvipa are of countable
qualities. The Siddhas of Dhaataki-khand are of countable qualities. The Siddhas
of Pushkaradvipa are of countable qualities. Thus, in the division of time and
other things, the lesser and greater should be known according to the Agama.
||10||  8938.  With a mind desiring the happiness of heaven and liberation, the
Aryas have named this Tattvarthavrittika, Sarvarth Siddhi. It is the essence of
the nectar of the Jinenadra's teachings, therefore, it should be constantly held
in mind with devotion. ||1|| Those who, knowing the essence of the truth, listen
to and read this Tattvarthavrittika with devotion to Dharma, have, as it were,
taken the nectar of supreme happiness in their hands. Then, what is there to be
said about the happiness of the Chakravartis and the Devas? ||2|| I bow with
devotion to those Veer Bhagawan, who have illuminated this undisputed truth of
all the Tattvas with their pure, perfect knowledge, and whose feet are
worshipped by humans and Devas. ||3||  Thus ends the tenth chapter of the
Tattvarthavrittika named Sarvarth Siddhi. May all be well.

Appendix 1 Sutra Text Chapter 1 1. Right faith, knowledge, and conduct are the
path to liberation. 12. Faith in the principles is right faith. 3. It is
acquired through their nature or through learning. 4. The principles are: soul,
non-soul, inflow, bondage, restraint, destruction, and liberation. 5. Their
definition is based on their substance, nature, and application. 6. They are
acquired through the means of knowledge. 7. They are established through the
principles of indication, ownership, means, field, and state. 8. They are many
due to their existence in different numbers, fields, contacts, times, and
differences. 9. Knowledge is of six types: faith, scripture, perception,
intuition, and omniscience. 10. They are the means of knowledge. 11. The first
four are indirect. 12. Perception is direct. 13. Faith, memory, understanding,
thinking, and comprehension are synonyms. 14. They are caused by the senses and
sense-objects. 15. Perception, apprehension, and retention are the functions of
the senses. 16. They are many, varied, quick, spontaneous, spoken, certain, and
others. 17. Of the object. 18. Apprehension of the meaning. 19. Not by the eye
or other senses. 20. Scripture is of twelve types, preceded by faith. 21. The
perception of existence is the intuition of the hell-beings and the gods. 22.
The perception of destruction and cessation is the intuition of the remaining
beings. 23. The intuition of the mind is straight and vast. 24. Its specific
nature is due to purity and impurity. 25. The intuition of the mind is specific
to the pure field, the owner, and the objects. 26. Faith and scripture are
dependent on the principles, but not on all the principles.  Paragraph Number 4

discipline, and possession of virtues; absence of transgressions in the
virtuous; constant utilization of knowledge and spiritual urgency - these are

necessary for the attainment of Tirthankara-hood.  25. Censure or praise of
others, and the revelation or concealment of their good or bad qualities - these
belong to the lower gotra.  26. The opposite of this is the higher gotra, and
there should be no pride in it.  27. Causing obstacles is antaraya.  Seventh

## Chapter 9  36. For understanding the establishment of the consequences of the
actions of obedience, [it is said]: "Dharmya." 37. "The former knowers are
white." 38. "The Kevalins are others." 39. "The arguments of separateness,
subtle actions, the cessation of the practice of actions, and the cessation of
actions." 40. "The three-one, the yoga-kaya, the yoga, and the a-yoga." 41. "In
the beginning, with the support of one, with deliberation and reflection." 42.
"The second is without reflection." 43. "Deliberation is the heard." 44.
"Reflection is the meaning, the expression, the yoga, and the transition." 45.
"The Samyakdrishti Shravakas, the Vira, the Ananta, the Viyojaka, the Darshan,
the Mohakṣapaka, the Upaśama, the Kopaśānta, the Mohakṣapaka, the Kṣīṇa, the
Moha, the Jinas, are gradually free from countless qualities." 46. "The Pulaka,
the Kushakusha, the Ula, the Nigrantha, the Snātaka, the Nirgrantha." 47. "The
Samyama, the Shruta, the Pratisevna, the Ati-tirtha, the Linga, the Leshya, the
Upāpāda, the Sthāna, are attainable by choice."  ## Chapter 10  1. "From the
destruction of delusion, from the destruction of the covering of knowledge and
the inner obstacles, comes Kevala." 2. "From the destruction of the causes of
bondage, from the destruction of karma, comes complete liberation from karma,
Moksha." 3. "And from the absence of the auspicious, etc., and the state of
being." 4. "Except for Kevala, Samyaktvagyanadarshan, and Siddhatva." 5. "After
that, it goes upwards, towards the light." 6. "From the previous practice, from
the non-association, from the cutting of bondage, and from the transformation of
the path." 7. "Like a potter's wheel that has been turned, like a water-filled
pot that has been emptied, like a castor oil plant, like a new fire flame." 8.
"From the absence of the Dharmastika." 9. "The Kṣetra, the Kāla, the Gati, the
Linga, the Tirtha, the Charitra, the Pratyekabuddha, are attainable."  "From the
knowledge of the Kabuddha, from the understanding of the knowledge, from the
inner number, from the multitude."

Tattvartha-vrtti, which destroys the impenetrable darkness. (1)  'The class
(varga) is the collection of powers (shakti-samudaya), as stated in the Sutras.
(1.1)  Regarding the 'path of liberation (moksha-marga)', the 'knower
(jnataram)' refers to the Buddhist, the 'destroyer (bhettaram)' refers to the
Naiyayika-Vaiseshika, and the 'enjoyer (bhoksharam)' refers to the Yogin. (2.3)
The definition (lakshanam) is the determination (vidhanam) based on the specific
nature (prakara). The mere statement of the essence (svarupa-kathana-matram) is
the purpose (uddesha-matram). (4.5)  The 'distinctly separated (viviktam)' means
free from the obstruction of the mobile (trasa). (4.5)  A certain worthy one
(kascid bhavyah) is named Prasiddha. (4.7)  'Delusion (moha) is the firm
(nishtha) non-ascertainment.' The word 'firm' (nishtha-shabdena) denotes the
conduct (charitra) of liberation. The one whose firm state (nishtha) is near
(pratyasanna) is called 'near-firm' (pratyasanna-nishthah). (4.7)  'Agurna'
means 'uplifted (udyatah)'. (4.8)  'Visarga' means the utterance (ucchayana) in
the context of description (nirupana-karmani). (8.22)  'Upasdya' means 'having
approached near (samipe gatva)'. (11.15)  'Karma' refers to the substance-karma
and the state-karma (bhava-karma). (1.8)  The qualities (guna) of universals
(jati), attributes (guna), actions (kriya), and substances (dravya) are the
qualifiers (viseshana) where the thing (vastu) does not possess that quality
(atad-gunam). (13.2)  The doctrine (vada) devoid of proof (pramana) is false
(prada). They consider the Tirthankaras as themselves, due to the absence of the
essential nature (niscaya-rupa-shunyatva). (1.10)  'Nikshepya' means the
designated place (vivakshita-pradesha) of the dice (akshanam) and the ropes
(pashananam). The word 'adi' refers to the basket (varataka) and others. (13.6)
'Liberation (moksha) is the absolute destruction of the nine innate qualities of
the self, such as knowledge, happiness, sorrow, attachment, aversion, effort,
merit, demerit, and impressions.' (2.1)  1. There is another reading 'mala-
apratima-prabodhah'. 2. The reason for this verse is not clear. It is the 45th
verse of Amita-gati's Pañcasaṃgraha.

## 390] **Sarvarthasiddhi** 13.12 It is not appropriate to say that the three
characteristics of Audarika-Vaikriyika-Aharakalakshanatraya are six, because the
giving of the appropriate pudgala to the seven Paryapti is not karma. 13.13 The
Vedak Samyaktv, which is the beginning of the destruction of the Prakruti, is
infused and matured. 13.15 When the Yukta Jiva, having become a Kritakritya
Vedak with Samyagdristi, turns towards Kshayika Samyaktv for the elimination of
the Aprakruti, which is not present, then if he dies for the elimination of the
Mukhyajiva, then for the establishment of the Antarmuhurta of the Kritakritya
Vedak, for the description of the Kalajiva, etc., If he dies in the first part
of the four parts of the Praman, then he is born in the Devas. If he dies in the
second part, then he is born in the Devas or the Manusyas. If he dies in the
third part, then he is born in the Devas, Manusyas, or Tiryanchas. If he dies in
the fourth part, then he is born in any of the four Gatis. Therefore, the Vedak
Samyagdristi should be known as Pragrhy-Paricchidy. According to the Praman,
there is no contradiction in the birth of the Tiryancha Gati and Narak Gati,
because of the existence of the fourfold characteristics of Swarupa, etc., in
relation to the Pararupa, etc. Similarly, the Aparyaptakas should be known as
Kshayopa-samik Samyaktv, because of the non-existence of the fourfold
characteristics in relation to the Pararupa, etc. The rest is due to the special
proficiency. If the Parinati is destroyed, then the Kshayika of the Tiryanchas
does not exist. Why? Because the characteristics of Satva, Asatva, Nitya,
Anitya, etc., are based on the special Parinama, which is related to the Artha.
17.1 The human being who is born in the Karmabhumij is the one who begins the
destruction of Darshan and Moh. Before the beginning of the destruction, the
Tiryanchas are under the control of the Nidarsha...||7|| Even if the lifespan is
bound, the Tiryancha who is born in the excellent Bhogabhumijati is born only in
the Tiryancha Purushas, not in the Tiryancha Stree. It is said, "The Darshan and
Moh Kshapana, which is the beginning of the Kshayika and Kshayopa-samik
Samyaktv, is taken by the rule in the Manusya Gati, the one who is born in the
Karmabhumij, and not the Nishthaphak. Therefore, the Paryaptak and Aparyaptak
Narakas are born in the first Naraka and in all the Gatis." The word "Pattavag"
in the gatha means "the beginning", and the word "Nivago" means "Samyaktv". 17.4
The Manushees are Bhava-vedi Stree, not Dravya-vedi Stree, because the Kshayika
is not possible for them. 1. "The Vedak Dristi is born in the Karmabhumina
Rishi, who is his own. The Kritakritya, who has the Kshayika Dristi, is bound by
the lifespan in the four Gatis."

Appendix 2 [391 2- Not possible. NNN w w w w N No, because the Dravyavedi
women's Kshayik Samyaktv, Samyam, Upsham Samyaktv and both Aharak, if one of
these is present, the rest are not. 'Aharaya Doshin' from 17.5, in the state of
Apariapta, how can the Upshamik Samyaktv of the Devas be possible? - Aharak and
Aharak Mishra should be taken.  Because of the impossibility of death of the
Kta.  It is not appropriate, because the death of those who have Upshamik
Samyaktv with Mithyatv as the cause is impossible.  Those who have Upshamik
Samyaktv with Vedak as the cause, by rule, ascend the Shreni, so the Shreni-
19.7, how can the Navveyakvasi, because of being Ahminndra, die with Charitramoh
Upsham, in the state of Apariapta?  If so, it is said, some Samyakdrishti, even
in the state of Apariapta of the Devas, Upshamik Samyaktv is possible. He does
that, hearing it, another who is there, takes Samyaktv. [Doubt- How can Upshamik
Samyaktv be possible for the Devas in the state of Apariapta, because the death
of the beings with Upshamik Samyaktv is impossible?  Answer- It is not a fault.
It is not right to say so.  The beings who attain Upshamik Samyaktv from the
Mithyatv guna-sthan, their death is impossible, but those who have Upshamik
Samyaktv with Vedak as the cause, they ascend the Shreni by rule.  Doubt- Nav
Aveyakvasi Devas are Ahminndra, how can they hear Dharma Shravana?  Answer- Some
Samyakdrishti, hearing it, another who is there, takes Samyaktv.  Or, there is
no discussion about Praman Nay etc. in them.  There is general Tattv Vichar like
the Lingi, so the beings who have attained Charitramoh Upsham, die and become
Devas by rule.  There is no fault. ] Upshamik Samyaktv is possible even in the
state of Apariapta of the Devas. 8.30 20.5 The best state of Sansarik Kshayik
Samyaktv is 6. 27 Trayastrishat Sagaropamani.  The characteristic of Sagaropama
is 18.2, why is the Upshamik Samyaktv of Parihar Shuddhi Samyata not possible?
"Dahakoda Kodiyo Palljava, Sa Sayaru Uchai Ekkanaastiti Cheduchyate,
Manahparyaya Parihar Shuddhi Upshamik- Tava."  Sant Muhurta Ashtavarsha Heen
Purvakoti Dwayadhik.  Among the Samyaktv Aharakrdhi, if one is possible, the
other three are not possible later.  The Sansari Vishistta of that is not
possible.  Because, it is possible.  Because, in Manahparyaya, Mithyatv Purvak
Upsham- should be prohibited, not Vedak Purvak.  It is said- 'Padhvas Du
Parimaan Sar Khalu Sadahasakodiyo. 'Manapjjav Pariharo Ubasama Sammataharaya
Donni. Chhappanna Cha Sahasssa Nayavva Vasagananaae. 'Edasi Ekkagave 'Seshanam
Sambhavo Natthi. ' Thus, the lifespan of the one who is born with Purvakoti
years, after eight years, Aharaya Donni... Aharak Aharak Mishra... After years,
in the inner Muhurta, he destroys Darshan Moh, Kshayik [Why is the Upshamik
Samyaktv of Parihar Shuddhi Samyata not possible? Samyakdrishti is born.  He
performs Tapascharan, makes all things perfect, not possible?  The answer is
that Manahparyaya, Parihar Shuddhi, Upshamik Samyaktv and Aharakrdhi, if one of
these is present, the other three are not possible.  But because of the
impossibility of staying for a longer time.  If it happens, he becomes the
beginning of Darshan Moh Kshapana, then the other three do not cross it, it is
said- 'Khavanae Pattayago Jammi Bhave Niyamdo Tado Anna.  Nakar Nakamadi Tinni
Bhave Dasanmohammi Khiinami. ' (Pra. Panchasam. 1/203) 1. Go. Ji., Ga. 728.

## 392] **Sarvarthasiddhi** [The highest state of Kshayika Samyaktvam in the
worldly realm is thirty-three Shankas. When added to the human lifespan, it
results in sixty-six Sagaras, and eight years less than two Purvakoti Sagaras.
Does this mean that the lifespan of a human is greater than two Purvakoti
Sagaras?**  **Answer:** Such a doubt should not be entertained. Because one
Sagar is said to be equal to the lifespan of ten Kodakodi Palya. The lifespan of
the heavens is measured in Sagaras, and the worldly characteristics are shed at
the end of the last Sagar. This is explained as follows:  A being born in the
realm of karma, with a lifespan of 31 Purvakoti years, after being born in the
womb, attains Kshayika Samyakdrishti after eight years, and after that, the
destruction of Darshanamoha takes place in the last Muhurta. Thus, he attains
Sarvarthasiddhi through the practice of Tapas.  **Explanation:**  There are
numerous differences in Samyakdarshan, in terms of words. According to the
calculation of years, seventy lakh fifty-six thousand crore years constitute one
Purva. Thus, there are countless and infinite variations of Samyakdarshan.
There are countless and infinite differences in the Samyakdarshan of those who
have faith and those who are worthy of faith, because the tendencies of those
who have faith are countless and infinite. There are also countless and infinite
differences in those who are worthy of faith, because Samyakdarshan is the
subject of faith.  **Therefore, there are countless and infinite differences in
Samyakdarshan.**  **20.7** The Vedaka has sixty-six Sagaras. This is how:  In
the Saudharma, Shukra, and Satara heavens, the lifespan is two, sixteen,
eighteen, and thirty Sagaras respectively. Or, in the Saudharma heaven, if a
being is born twice, the lifespan is four Sagaras. In the Sanatkumar, Brahma,
Lantava, and Uparimauveyak heavens, the lifespan is seven, ten, fourteen, and
thirty-one Sagaras respectively.  **22.3** The lifespan of a human being is
greater than the lifespan of these heavens. This is not a cause for doubt. The
lifespan of the last Sagar is the remaining lifespan after the human lifespan
has passed. This is accepted.  **8.35** The highest state of Kshayika
Samyaktvam, the Vedaka, is sixty-six Sagaras. This is how:  In the Saudharma
heaven, the lifespan is two Sagaras. In the Shukra heaven, the lifespan is
sixteen Sagaras. In the Satara heaven, the lifespan is eighteen Sagaras. In the
Uparimauveyak heaven, the lifespan is thirty Sagaras. The total of these is
sixty-six Sagaras.  Or, in the Saudharma heaven, if a being is born twice, the
lifespan is four Sagaras. In the Sanatkumar heaven, the lifespan is seven
Sagaras. In the Brahma heaven, the lifespan is ten Sagaras. In the Lantava
heaven, the lifespan is fourteen Sagaras. In the Uparimauveyak heaven, the
lifespan is thirty-one Sagaras. The total of these is also sixty-six Sagaras.
**23.1** How is it possible that a single Anivriti Gunasthan can have both
Vedatva and Avedatva?  **Answer:** Anivriti Gunasthan is divided into six parts.
In the first three parts, the Vedas remain, hence Vedatva. In the remaining
parts, the Vedas are lost, hence Avedatva.

Appendix 2 [393 6. 37 The number of 23.5 samyag-dṛṣṭi (right belief) without
contradiction. Samyag-mithyā-dṛṣṭi (mixed right and wrong belief) is (29699103).
It is said that pure knowledge (kevala-jñāna) is not possible. Its three types
of mixed knowledge - 'The six senses, nine births, and five negligences
(pramattā) occur.' Due to the threefold basis. And it is said, 'The vigilant
(apramatta) and the restrained (saṃyata) are innumerable, that is, the
restrained with negligence are half of them-two crore ninety-nine lakh ninety-
three thousand.' In the description of its ignorance, it should be seen that the
number is one hundred and three. It is also said - due to the absence of the
object of knowledge as it really is in the case of the restrained with
negligence. 59398206 are the restrained with negligence and the vigilant are
half of them.] [In the case of samyag-mithyā-dṛṣṭi, neither pure knowledge nor
pure ignorance occurs, but in each of the eight upasama-gaṇas (stages of
subsidence of passions), in each of the eight moments, there are three types of
mixed knowledge. It is also said - 'Know the number sixteen, twenty-four,
thirty, thirty-six, forty-two, forty-eight, fifty-four, fifty-four. The mixed
stages are eight, four, two, and one.' The omniscient author, while speaking of
knowledge, has not mentioned its number, considering the highest number, but in
the description of its ignorance, one should see its number, because the samyag-
mithyā-dṛṣṭi does not know the object as it really is.] 'Know the sixteen,
twenty-four, thirty, thirty-six, forty-two, forty-eight, fifty-four, fifty-four.
The restrained and the unrestrained, the four upasama-gaṇas (stages of
subsidence of passions).' 8.45 The number, with respect to the entry of one,
two, or three, and the highest of four or five, is to be understood by the
commentators as limited to a part of a palyopama (an immeasurably large number)
with reference to the entry into the eighth moment. The previous is according to
the words. It is stated in its own time. The numbers that have arisen in their
own time are not much different from each other in terms of quantity. There, in
one or the other stage, they are of the measure of two hundred. The second is
much more than the first. The third is much more than the second, as stated. The
restrained and the unrestrained are everywhere few. The restrained with
negligence are ninety-nine thousand two hundred and eight. Koti-pṛthaktva
(multiplicity of millions) number: Koti-pañcaka-tri-navati-lakṣa-aṣṭa (five
million, ninety-three lakh, eight). They are of the measure of ninety-two
thousand two hundred. The four upasama-gaṇas (stages of subsidence of passions)
are one each in the stages. Out of the eight moments, in one moment each, they
are 16, [The numbers mentioned further are - in the case of sāsādana-samyag-
dṛṣṭi (right belief attained through spiritual effort), they are 24, 30, 36, 42,
48, 54, 54. Taking eight moments up to the restrained and the unrestrained, the
number of each is the infinitesimal part of the palyopama of the four stages.
This number contains only the numbers 16, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 54. The
similarity is in the words, not in the meaning, because there is an increase or
decrease in the specific numbers in the initial moments. The sixteen highest
numbers up to the sāsādana-samyag-dṛṣṭi should be known, but the number of those
with mixed stages is more. It is said - 'The number of upasama-gaṇas is sixteen,
and the number of those with mixed right belief is much more. Twenty-four,
thirty, thirty-six, forty-two, forty-eight, fifty-four, the restrained and the
unrestrained are the least. Know the number of the restrained with negligence
and fifty-four.']  The fifty-four that the Sarva-ārthasiddhi-kāra (the
omniscient author) has mentioned is the highest number of the apramatta-saṃyatas
(the vigilant restrained). Half of that is a koti (ten million). The entry into
the eighth moment is mentioned. In its own time.

## Sarvarthasiddhi [394]  The number of beings gathered in the
**Sarvarthasiddhi** is countable, meaning there are 25.2 **Chaturnakshapka** and
**Ayogakevali** in each of the eight **Gunasthanas**. It is also said, "The time
sequence should be seen as before. Only the **Tegamupashamaka** are 299 in the
**Gunasthanas**."  The number should be doubled. It is said, "In each
**Gunasthanas** of the **Vishesharth-Upashama** series, there are 32, 48, 60,
72, 84, 96, 108, 108. In time, the **Charitramohaniya** is pacified by the
**Chhannaudi** 78, 178, and **Bodhabhava**. From the lowest, one being enters,
and from the highest, 54 beings enter. This statement is general. In comparison
to the specific, there are eight more years. Here also, one or two, etc., are
mentioned separately from the eight-time entry. In time, there are eight
consecutive **Upashama** series suitable for the **Yogya**. Each of them has 89
**Uttarasamaya**. In the first **Samaya**, one being enters from the beginning
of the five **Gunasthanas** and ascends to 16 beings in the highest form. In the
tenth **Samaya**, one being ascends from the beginning to 24 beings in the
highest form. In the third **Samaya**, one being ascends from the beginning to
30 beings in the highest form. In the fourth **Samaya**, one being ascends from
the beginning to 36 beings in the highest form. In the fifth **Samaya**, one
being ascends from the beginning to 42 beings in the highest form. In the sixth
**Samaya**, one being ascends from the beginning to 48 beings in the highest
form. In the seventh **Samaya**, one being ascends from the beginning to 54
beings in the highest form. In the eighth **Samaya**, one being ascends from the
beginning to 54 beings in the highest form. The total of all these is 304, but
many **Acharyas** say 299 by subtracting five. In the **Dhavala**, **Vira Sena
Swami** has mentioned the number 299 as the proof of entry in the eighth
**Samaya**. He has called himself the **Acharya** tradition. See **Pu. 3, p.
92**.  The quantity of each **Kshapka** gathered in time is 598. The quantity of
all four **Kshapkas** and the fifth **Ayogakevali** in the eighth **Samaya** is
3000. It is also said, "The quantity of **Kshina Kshaya** is 3000, meaning 2990.
What then? There are five **Hima**." The quantity of **Apshamaka** is 199. The
quantity of **Sayogakevali** is double, meaning 398.  [Doubt - In eight
**Samayas**, the sum of 16, 32, etc., numbers is 304? Solution - It is not right
to say that the **Kshapkas** mentioned are different in meaning. Even if the
**Upashamaka** are not continuous in eight **Samayas**, they are not complete in
comparison to the number gathered in their own time, but they are five less. The
**Sayogakevali** are less in their own time. Therefore, the sum of the
**Upashamaka** from the eighth to the eleventh **Samaya** is 1199. The quantity
of the **Chatur Gunasthanavarti** **Upashamaka** is 898502.  It is said,

Appendix 2 [395 'Eight hundred thousand and eighty-nine thousand. Thus it is
said - measured by the fraction of Pratara. Series by series, the number of
Khamoshijana is five hundred and two. ' Multiplied by Pratara, it becomes
Pratara. Measured by the fraction of that number, -[Go. Ji. 628] the number of
series, as many regions as there are, so many Narakas are there [The number of
Sayogakevalis is also twice the number of Upshamkas, therefore, in eight times,
the first time, the first earth, the number of Mithyadristi Narakas is
innumerable, the series are in order, one or two, etc., up to thirty-two. Doubt
- What is this series? Answer - One should know the difference between the
number and the excellent number. - Like a garland of seven long pearls The rows
of regions of the sky are called series. This doubt - Then it is useless to say
that the number of Sayogakevalis is different from the number of Kshapakas
mentioned (because the Kshapakas are twice the number of Upshamkas?) Multiplying
the series by Pratara, Pratara is obtained. Measured by the fraction of that
Pratara, the number of innumerable series, as many regions as there are, so many
Mithyadristi Narakas are there in the first Naraka. The number of Sayogakevalis
in their own time is equal to the number of Kshapakas, The quantity of
Sayogakevalis in their own time is one lakh, that is, eight lakh eighty 25.11
For a subtle human being, the number of Mithyadristi humans is nine thousand
five hundred and two. It is also said - 'The number of Sayogakevalis is measured
by the fraction of the number of series. The number of Sayogakevalis, starting
from Sasadan and ending with Sanjata, is eight lakh eighty-nine thousand five
hundred and two.'] 000. Mixed 1040000000. Unsanjata: All these are together,
starting from Pramatta and ending with A-yogakevali, the number of excellent
regions is 7000000000. Regions 130000000. And if they happen to be together at
one time, then three less - It is said - The number is nine crore (89999997).
Thirteen crore regions, in the Sasana, in the Mani, or in the Misra, then twice
that number, seven crore and fifty. ' 'Twenty-seven, eighty, six in the middle,
all those who are Sanjata. [From the human path, from Sasadan Gunasthan to
Sanjata, I bow down to Anjali Mauli, Hatho, Tiyaran, Suddho, Namansami. ' The
number of humans from Sanjata to Sanjata is countable. It is also said (Go. Ji.
632) In the fifth region, in the Gunasthan, there are thirteen crore humans
[From Pramatta Sanjata to A-yogakevali, all these are there, in the Sasadan
Gunasthan, there are fifty-two crore, and in the Sanjata Gunasthan, there are
twice as many, that is, one hundred and four crore humans. If they are all
together at one time, their number is three less than nine crore. It is also
said. The number of all Sanjatas is eight crore crore. ' Ninety-nine lakh
ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine. I bow down to them with
folded hands, and with pure mind, speech, and body. 26.7 The number of
Paryaapta-Pthivyadika-Kayikas is innumerable. Now, what is this name, Loka?
Pratara multiplied by series becomes Loka, a special measure. 25.7 Innumerable
series. Now, what is this series? [If the quantity of Paryaapta-Pthivyadika-
Kayika etc. beings is mentioned, it is innumerable Lokas. Multiplying Pratara by
series, Loka is obtained, a special measure. This is a difference in quantity.]

## 396] **Saathasaddhi** 8.60 It is not correct to say that the five senses are
not found in the middle and heavenly realms, because the five senses are found
in hell, the 29.12 realms, and in the state of Dandakavat of the Sayogakevali,
in comparison to the middle and heavenly realms. The realm of the Uttaraloka is
an immeasurable part of the realm, in comparison to the Pratara.  The five
senses are found only in specific places within the Nali, just as the three
Vatalayas are found only in their respective regions, due to the pervasiveness
of the realm. The entire realm is the realm of the Sayogakevali, in comparison
to the filling of the realm. Therefore, their realm is also an immeasurable part
of the realm. (The realm of the Sayogakevali is an immeasurable part of the
realm in comparison to the Dand and Kapata forms of the opening. The realm is an
immeasurable part of the realm in comparison to the Pratara form of the opening.
8.75 33.1 The size of the realm is an immeasurable number of Yojanakoti Akash
Pradesh, because their extent is only up to the three Vatalayas. The realm is
three hundred and forty-three times the size of a square with a side equal to
the length of the Lakshana Rajju. The realm is filled with the movement of the
soul in its own place, the movement in another place, and the birth of the soul
at the end of its life, without any interval between the places. The filling of
the realm is done by the souls, in comparison to the opening. In comparison to
the movement in its own place, the realm of the Saasadan Sayogakevali is the
entire realm.  The immeasurable part of the realm is clear to the Samyagdrsti.
The immeasurable part of the realm should be seen in comparison to the movement
in its own place. 5.62 In comparison to the movement in another place, the realm
of the Saasadan Devas, the first one-sensed beings, is the entire realm. Their
movement is in all three earths, and their extent is two Rajjus. The realm of
the Vikalendriya is an immeasurable part of the realm, because they are born
above the Achyutanta. Their movement is six Rajjus, which is one-eighth of the
fourteen parts. The three Sanadas, the Devas, the Narakas, and the humans, are
born in specific places. This means that they are eight Rajjus out of the
fourteen Rajjus. The eight parts of the fourteen parts are to be seen as
follows: the first eight parts are in the first three islands, the Lavana Udal,
the Kaloda Udal, and the Samudra, and the second eight parts are in the
Swayambhu Raman Island and the Swayambhu Raman Samudra. The remaining
immeasurable islands and seas are not included. The Narakas, the Swargas, the
Bhogbhumi, and the Mlechchas are all in the seventh earth, where the Saasadan
and other groups have been abandoned. The five senses are born in the sixth
earth, like humans. This is not correct, because the five senses are born in the
Manushottara, and their realm is an immeasurable part of the realm. The five
senses are born in the Naraka, the Tiryanch, the Deva, and the Lokagre Badar
earth, and their extent is seven Rajjus, which is twelve parts. The Saasadan is
born from the Vayu Kaya, and their extent is an immeasurable part of the realm.
This is not beautiful, because the four places of the Tejas Kaya, the Naraka,
the Sarvasukshma Kaya, and the Lakshana are born in specific places within the
three Sanadas. The Saasadan is born everywhere except in these four places. This
is the reason for the immeasurable part of the realm. 'Vajjiya Thaan Chaukka
Teuu Vaaoo Yanir Ayasamham Cha. [The realm of the one-sensed beings is the
entire realm, because they are found everywhere. Annatya Savvatthaane Uvavajjadi
Saasano Jeevo.' The Saasadan Jeeva is found in all places. Some places are not
suitable for the touch of the Saasadan. The entire realm should be seen in
comparison to the places suitable for touch. [Further, the touch is mentioned.
An immeasurable number of crore Yojan Akash Pradesh is the size of one Rajju.
The realm is three hundred and forty-three times the size of a cube with a side
equal to the length of the Rajju. The souls move in their own place, move in
another place, and are born at the end of their life. The five senses are born
in the Manushottara, and their realm is an immeasurable part of the realm. The
five senses are born in the Naraka, the Tiryanch, the Deva, and the Lokagre
Badar earth, and their extent is seven Rajjus, which is twelve parts. The
Saasadan is born from the Vayu Kaya, and their extent is an immeasurable part of
the realm. This is not beautiful, because the four places of the Tejas Kaya, the
Naraka, the Sarvasukshma Kaya, and the Lakshana are born in specific places
within the three Sanadas. The Saasadan is born everywhere except in these four
places. This is the reason for the immeasurable part of the realm.  The five
senses are born in the sixth earth, like humans. This is not correct, because
the five senses are born in the Manushottara, and their realm is an immeasurable
part of the realm. The five senses are born in the Naraka, the Tiryanch, the
Deva, and the Lokagre Badar earth, and their extent is seven Rajjus, which is
twelve parts. The Saasadan is born from the Vayu Kaya, and their extent is an
immeasurable part of the realm. This is not beautiful, because the four places
of the Tejas Kaya, the Naraka, the Sarvasukshma Kaya, and the Lakshana are born
in specific places within the three Sanadas. The Saasadan is born everywhere
except in these four places. This is the reason for the immeasurable part of the
realm.  The realm of the Vikalendriya is an immeasurable part of the realm,
because the Devas, the Narakas, and the humans are born in specific places. The
Vikalendriya are born in the Lavana Udal and the Kaloda Udal seas in the two and
a half islands, and in the Swayambhu Raman Island and the Swayambhu Raman
Samudra. They are not born in the remaining immeasurable islands and seas. They
are also not born in the Narakas, the Swargas, the Bhogbhumi, and the Mlechchas
in the seventh earth. The five senses are born in the sixth earth, like humans.
This is not correct, because the five senses are born in the Manushottara, and

Appendix 2 1397 should be.  Sāsādan rajjavas are touched in comparison to
parastānavihāra.  For those with samyag and mithyādrishti, the first three
earths in the maranāntika samyagdristi deva's vihāra are produced in the
urbandhāvasthā, and due to the rule of leaving that gunasthāna, two rajus and
above, up to the achyuta svarga, the vihāra is a countless part of the loka in
comparison to the parastānavihāra, and touching it makes six rajus, in this way
eight out of fourteen rajus.  For those with asanyata samyagdristi, there is
also touching in comparison to maranāntika, that is, eight rajus out of the
fourteen rajus of sanāḍī.  This is because their field is small, as is known
everywhere.  In this way, it is known that eight out of fourteen is the same as
twelve out of fourteen. In the seventh, in comparison to the production of
maranāntika by those with mithyādrishti, the remaining countless part of the
three lokas is left out of the six and seventh earths, including sāsādan and
other gunasthānas.  The jīva with the mithyātvagunasthāna is the rule. In
comparison to parastānavihāra, there is also touching in comparison to
maranāntika, because it is a rule that the maranāntika samyagdristi produces.
And if it is not said, then the maranāntika of those who are not in naraka is
produced from the sixth earth to the middle loka, five rajus, before the
production of sāsādan.  And the samyagdristi does maranāntika.  And from the
middle loka, sāsādan does not go down, so according to the rule, the sāsādan is
in the front part of the loka, in the bādarapṛthivīkāya, jalakāya, and in the
front part of the loka, in the bādarapṛthivīkāya, etc., there is also touching
in comparison to maranāntika in the vanaspathikāya, making seven rajus, in this
way twelve rajus are touched.  The sāsādan samyagdristi is produced in the
vāyukāya, tejasakāya, naraka, and sarva sūksmakāya, leaving out these four
places, everywhere, in comparison to the maranāntika of those with
mithyādrishti.  It is clear.  Or in comparison to the production of pṛthivīkāya,
etc., there.  It is also said, "Leaving out the tejasakāya, vāyukāya, naraka,
and sūksma-kāya, the jīva is produced everywhere else.  The touching of the
sarvaloka is to be seen in this way everywhere.  Some places are not suitable
for the sāsādan, the jīva's mithyādrishti sāsādan samyagdristi deva's third
earth touching, so it is said that the loka's front part, in the
bādarapṛthivīkāya, etc., is less (deshon).  Further, in comparison to the places
that are not suitable for touching everywhere, nine rajjavas.  It is to be known
that the nine rajjavas touching is also in this way in the future. It is to be
seen.  For those with samyag and mithyādrishti, and asanyata samyagdristi, eight
rajjavas in comparison to vihāra, because there is no production in the
ekaindriya.  8.76 [For those with samyag and mithyādrishti, and asanyata
samyagdristi deva, in comparison to parastānavihāra, eight rajjavas are touched
in comparison to parastānavihāra.  Those with samyata and asanyata are touched.
For those with the fifth gunasthāna of svayambhūramaṇa, in comparison to the
maranāntika in the achyuta svarga, six rajjavas are touched.  The field of those
with pramatta samyata, etc., is fixed, and because the production place is fixed
in the bhavantara, and because the fourth gunasthāna is in the production, the
field of the jīvas with the gunasthāna is fixed, and the production place is
also fixed in the bhavantara, and because the fourth gunasthāna is in the
production, because the field is not covered by the samacaturasra rajjū pradeśa,
the countless part of the loka.  The touching of those with sayogakevali is like
the field, the countless part of the loka, countless rajjū quantity, and the
sarvaloka.  All narakī are produced in the samacaturasra rajjū pradeśa, and
because they are not covered by the samacaturasra rajjū pradeśa, their touching
is a countless part of the loka.  The production of those with sayogakevali is
in the sañjñīparyāptakapancendriya, in the tiryakṣu, or in the manuṣya.  There,
because the first earth is close, the narakī with the fourth gunasthāna touch a
countless part of the loka below.  Because the quantity of rajjū is not there,
the countless part of the loka, the countless part of the loka, and the
sarvaloka.  All narakī are produced in the sañjñīparyāptakapancendriya, in the
tiryakṣu, or in the manuṣya.  There, because the first earth is close, the
narakī with the fourth gunasthāna touch a countless part of the loka below.
Because the quantity of rajjū is not there, the countless part of the loka, the
countless part of the loka, and the sarvaloka.  All narakī are produced in the
sañjñīparyāptakapancendriya, in the tiryakṣu, or in the manuṣya.  There, because
the first earth is close, the narakī with the fourth gunasthāna touch a
countless part of the loka below.  Because the quantity of rajjū is not there,
the countless part of the loka, the countless part of the loka, and the

## Translation:  **3981**  The four *guna-sthana*-dwelling hell-beings
constitute an infinitesimal part of the *sparmana* realm. The second earth is
situated below the *madhyaloka* at the extent of one *raju*. Similarly, the
third and subsequent earths are situated at an interval of one *raju* each.
Therefore, the hell-beings with *mithyadrishti* and *sasadan samyagdristi* on
these earths have touched at least one, two, three, four, and five *rajus*. The
*samyaramadyadrishti* hell-beings, at the time of *maranantik* (death), *utpad*
(birth), and *ayubandha* (life-span), regularly leave the third *guna-sthana*
because these three actions do not occur in the third *guna-sthana*. Therefore,
their touch, compared to their dwelling place, is an infinitesimal part of the
*sparmana* realm. The touch of the restrained *samyagdristi* hell-beings is also
an infinitesimal part of the realm compared to their *maranantik*, because they
are regularly born as humans, and the human realm is small.  **Sarvarthasiddhi**
In the seventh earth, the hell-beings with *mithyadrishti* have touched six
*rajus* compared to their *maranantik* and *utpad*. The touch of the remaining
three *guna-sthana*-dwelling hell-beings is an infinitesimal part of the realm.
**Doubt:** Why is the touch of these three *guna-sthana*-dwelling hell-beings
not mentioned compared to their dwelling place and *maranantik*?  **Answer:**
The hell-beings of the seventh earth regularly leave those *guna-sthana* before
their *maranantik* and *utpad*.  It is a rule that *sasadan samyagdristi* does
not go to hell. Therefore, the touch of *sasadan samyagdristi* in the *tiryach*
realm, in the *badar prithvi* and other realms, is seven *rajus* compared to
their *maranantik*. The touch of humans with *mithyadrishti* is the entire realm
compared to their *maranantik*. Or, it is the entire realm compared to being
born as *prithvikayik* etc. humans; because the being who dies and is born
somewhere is called that in the *utpad* state. For example, a being who dies as
a *prithvikayik* and is born as a human is called a human in the *utpad* state.
The touch of the entire realm is like this everywhere.  **1. Go. Jo. Na. |
Mulachar Ga. 1134**  One should know that the hell-beings with *mithyadrishti*
and *sasadan samyagdristi* who go to the third hell have a touch of nine *rajus*
compared to their *maranantik* in the *badar prithvi* and other realms in the
front part of the realm. One should know that the touch of nine *rajus* is like
this further. And the *samyagmithyadrishti* and unrestrained *samyagdristi* are
not born as *ekendriya* beings. Their touch, compared to their dwelling place,
is eight *rajus*.  **§. 77**  **35.4. Panchendriyamipāvṛṣṭibhiḥ aṣṭau devān
prati sarvaloko manuṣyān prati sayogakevalināṁ daṇḍādyavasthāyāṁ
vāṅmanasavargaṇām avalambhyātmatra deśaparispandhābhāvātlokasya
asankhyeyabhāgaḥ.**  [One should know that the touch of the five-sense
*mithyadrishti* is eight *rajus* compared to the gods. That is, the five-sense
*mithyadrishti* gods dwell up to the third hell. Therefore, they are found
everywhere within the eight *raju* area, six *rajus* above the base of *meru*
and two *rajus* below. The touch of the entire realm is compared to humans. In
the state of punishment etc. of the *sayogakevali*, there is no expansion of the
self in the realms due to the dependence on the categories of speech and mind.
Therefore, the touch is an infinitesimal part of the realm.]  **5.85**  **37.9

[The hell-beings in the seven hells are of different shades as mentioned. It is
said:  "Time after time, they are like a drop of water in the ocean, or like a
speck of dust in the vast expanse of the sky." (Mulachar 1134)  In the sixth
earth, the hell-beings with *sasadan samyagdristi* of the black shade have
touched five *rajus* compared to their *maranantik* etc. In the fifth earth, the
hell-beings of the blue shade, excluding the black shade, have touched four
*rajus*. In the third earth, the hell-beings of the blue shade, excluding the
black shade, have touched one *raju* in the *kapotottala*. In the seventh earth,
although there are hell-beings of the black shade, *sasadan* is not possible
there in the state of *maranantik* etc. Therefore, they are not mentioned
because of the regular acceptance of *mithyatva*. The hell-beings of the

Appendix 2 [399 The six rajus are touched by the samayika-samayika jivas with
the tejo-leshya, in comparison to the maranantika, etc. The six rajus are
touched by the samayika-samayika jivas with the padma-leshya, in comparison to
the tyaga-vihara, etc. The five rajus are touched by the samayika-samayika jivas
with the shukla-leshya, in comparison to the adho-vihara, etc. The six rajus are
touched by the samayika-samayika jivas with the maranantika, etc., in comparison
to the mithyadrishti, etc. But the maranantika, etc., is not mentioned here
because the samayika-samayika jivas with the padma-leshya go towards mithyatva
due to the rule of the padma-leshya. The samayika-samayika jivas with the tejo-
leshya have touched the six rajus in comparison to the maranantika, etc., up to
the first heaven. The samayika-samayika jivas with the shukla-leshya have
touched the six rajus in comparison to the maranantika, etc., up to the sahasrar
heaven. The samayika-samayika jivas with the mithyadrishti, etc., have touched
the six rajus in comparison to the maranantika, etc., up to the sahasrar heaven.
The samayika-samayika jivas with the krishna-leshya, etc., have touched the six
rajus in comparison to the maranantika, etc., up to the sahasrar heaven. The
samayika-samayika jivas with the tejo-leshya, etc., have touched the six rajus
in comparison to the maranantika, etc., up to the sahasrar heaven. It is said:
"Teu teu tah teu pammasukka ya parmasukka lesa bhavanadi devaan." (Pra. Panch.
189) Doubt: Why are the eight rajus not touched in comparison to the vihara?
Solution: There is no need to doubt this because the shukla-leshya jivas do not
have a vihara below the heavens. As the naraki jivas have the krishna-leshya,
etc., in comparison to the three leshyas, so the deva jivas have the tejo-
leshya, etc., in comparison to the three leshyas. It is said: "Tinha donha doha
chhanha donha cha terasanha cha. Etho ya chaudasamha lesa bhavanadi devaan."
(Panch. Ga. 188) This means that the tejo-leshya is the lowest in the
bhavanavasi, vyantar and jyotishka devas. The tejo-leshya is the middle in the
saudharma and aishana heavens. The tejo-leshya is the highest in the sanatkumar
and mahendra heavens. The padma-leshya is the lowest in comparison to the tejo-
leshya, etc. The padma-leshya is the middle in the brahma, brahmoत्तर, lantva,
kapishtha, shukra and mahashukra heavens. The padma-leshya is the highest in the
shatar and sahasrar heavens. The shukla-leshya is the lowest in comparison to
the padma-leshya, etc. The shukla-leshya is the middle in the anata, pranata,
arana, achyuta and nava graveyaka heavens. The shukla-leshya is the highest in
the nava anudisha and pancha anusara heavens. It is said: "Ratnapraba adi
prithviyon mein kramse tejo-leshya, kapota, kapota, kapota-nila, nila, nila-
krishna, krishna and parmakrishna leshya hoti hain." The samayika-samayika jivas
with the krishna-leshya have touched the five rajus in comparison to the
maranantika, etc., in the sixth heaven. The samayika-samayika jivas with the
nila-leshya have touched the four rajus in comparison to the maranantika, etc.,
in the fifth heaven. The samayika-samayika jivas with the kapota-leshya have
touched the two rajus in comparison to the maranantika, etc., in the third
heaven. Although the krishna-leshya is present in the seventh heaven, it is not
present in the bhavanavasi, etc., devas because the samayika-samayika jivas with
the samayagdristi have touched the six rajus in comparison to the maranantika,
etc., in the three, two, two, six, two and thirteen heavens. There is no rule of
leshya elsewhere. [The naraki jivas have these leshyas in the seven narakas. It
is said: "Ratnapraba adi prithviyon mein kramse tejo-leshya, kapota, kapota,
kapota-nila, nila, nila-krishna, krishna and parmakrishna leshya hoti hain."

among humans, because those who have attained *Aupashmik* Samyaktvayukta with
*Vedak* Samyaktva (right knowledge) ascend the ladder of *Shreni* (spiritual
progress) and perform *Maranantik* (death-ending) actions. Those who have
attained *Aupashmik* Samyagdarshan with *Mithyatva* (false belief) cannot
perform *Maranantik* actions.]  **31** §. 89  **39.12** Why is the touch of the
*Sayogakevali* (those who have attained the state of complete liberation) an
innumerable part of the world?  **Answer:** In the state of *Aharak* (eating),
due to the absence of the *Samchatursra Rajju* (square-shaped touch) and other
types of touch, the *Sayogakevali* is *Aharak* (eating) by taking in *Pudgala*
(matter) suitable for the *Audarik* and *Audarik* *Mishra* (mixed) bodies,
through the *Galadana* (mouth) in the state of *Dand* (two-pronged touch) and
*Kapat* (two-door touch).  It is said: "In the state of *Dand* and *Kapat*,
there is *Audarik* (pure) body touch. In the state of *Pratar* (single-door
touch), there is *Audarik* *Mishra* (mixed) body touch. In the remaining three,
there is *Karman* (karmic) body touch." 1. 'Kammadao Ses Tattva Janhari' ||
Prao. Pansa 1/199  Due to the small area of the *Pinda* (body) in the *Dand* and
*Kapat* states, and the absence of the *Samchatursra Rajju* (square-shaped
touch) and other types of touch, the touch of the *Sayogakevali* is an
innumerable part of the world. In the case of *Anaharak* (non-eating) *Sasa*
(those who have attained the state of non-attachment and non-violence), there
are five Rajju (types of touch) because they are born in the *Tiryach* (lower
animal) realm from the sixth earth, and eleven Rajju because they are born in
the *Tiryach* realm from the *Achyuta* (heavenly) realm.  **Doubt:** Previously,
twelve Rajju were mentioned, and now eleven are mentioned. Is this a
contradiction?  **Answer:** This is not a contradiction, because the previous
statement was made with reference to the *Maranantik* (death-ending) state. In
the *Maranantik* state, there is no *Anaharak* (non-eating) state. The *Sasa*
performs *Maranantik* actions in the *Erkendriya* (five senses) state, not in
the *Utpad* (birth) state. At that time, the *Sasa* loses the state of *Sasa*
(non-attachment and non-violence).

Appendix 2 [401 Doubt- First you said twelve Rajus, now you have said twelve
Tapas after eight years of Nissanta Maharta. Doesn't this contradict the
previous statement? It is not appropriate to say that the remaining are created
after the completion of all the purposes and then they fall back. First, the
Marana-Kotia-Ayur-Utpann-Astavarsha-Antar-Samyama-Adadeti. In the context of the
near-death state, the twelve Rajus are said to be the least time. Because, all
beings are different in their transformations. But in the near-death state, the
being, being a dead body without food, first attains the non-distracted quality.
After that, it does not happen, but in the state of production, it is non-food.
The distracted quality is the side. There, it is in the state of the quality. In
the state of one-sense, the one who has attained the right vision, in the
remaining time of his own life, attains the distracted quality and dies. It does
not produce, because the time is the least for the one-being in the state of
production, and in the state of non-distraction, the state of being nourished is
lost. So, at the end of his own life, he attains the distracted quality and
dies. Even for the distracted one-being, the least time is four Upa-Shamakas, up
to forty-five, as far as possible, simultaneously. 40.1 Time- The least time is
one Muhurta, even thousands of Muhurtas, even though there is a possibility of
entering death, the quantity of breaths is seventy-three more than seven
hundred, in relation to different beings, in relation to one being. The least
time is one Muhurta. Now, even for the wrong vision, there is one time, why is
it not possible to have a Muhurta, a longer time, an Avali, etc. within it? This
is not justified, because the time of attaining wrong vision is very large. If
this is so, there will be countless differences. Because death is not possible
within a Muhurta. It is said, 'The one who has attained wrong vision, with
countless connections. 'Three thousand, with a hundred, always, thirteen
breaths. As long as the Avali-Pako is within the Muhurta, there is no mind. This
is the greatest of all human beings. Even in the case of right and wrong vision,
at the time of death, due to the abandonment of that quality state, there is a
change of half a Pudgala, which is less than the excellence. And that is
possible for the transmigrating being. The one who has attained restraint, the
restrained, the restrained quality, and the liberated ones' (T. Su. 2,10) will
be discussed later. The one who is nourished dies within a Muhurta, so for the
non-restrained, restrained, and restrained one-being, there are six Avalis in
excellence. Even one Avali is one time. For the four Upa-Shamakas, the non-
Kevali, there is countless time. And because of the possibility of liberation,
there is no possibility of death within the interval, the least time is less
than the one-being, and the greatest time is within the Muhurta. For the one who
has attained the Kevali, one 'Avali' is countless time. Avali is the breath. For
the one-being, the least time is one Muhurta, after attaining that quality
state, the breath is the least, the least, the least, the least. In the middle
of the Muhurta, after attaining the non-quality state. In excellence, the
previous 'thirty-three Balva, Nali-Benaliya, the greatest is. After eight years
of Koti, taking up Tapas, only produces. Thirty Muhurtas, a day, fifteen days,
it is ripe. Because of the deficiency of years, it is less. So it is said. For
the one-being of right and wrong vision, the least time is the least Muhurta,
and in excellence, the greatest time is the Muhurta. [Now, the time is being
told. The least time is one Muhurta, after that, the quality changes, it should
be understood later. Non-restrained, right-vision, one-being, in excellence,
there are thirty oceans of Muhurtas. Within it, there is a Muhurta. There are
many more. Because, some being, in the previous Koti-Ayur-Utpann- 1. Go. Ji.
573. 2. Go. Ji. 574. 'Egasamaena Heena Bhinna Muhutta Tado Ses' iti
Uttarardhapatha Jamboo. Po. 13/5-6. 3. The death should be understood at the
time of the descent of the previous action. In the first part of the ascending
previous action- 'Missahara-Ssa Ya Khavagacha Dhamanapadam Puvva Ya.
Padamuvasamma Tama Tamaguna Padivanna Ya Na Maranti.' According to the Agam,
there is no death. Now, it should not be doubted that even the four Upa-
Shamakas, having attained their respective quality states from the lower quality
states, stay there for one time each, and then there is one time each for them.
Because, it is not possible, and if it is possible, it will contradict the
statement that the least time is between the least and the Muhurta. It will be
discussed later that the least time for the four Upa-Shamakas is one Muhurta for
the one-being.

## 402] **Sarvarthasiddhi**  The **antarmuhurt** is a very short period of time.
Thus, there are countless variations of the **antarmuhurt** for the **guna
sthana** of a living being, compared to a single being. It is also said, "Time
is also a moment." For all four **upshamaka**s, as in "All humans have a
**muhurt** of entry and residence together, up to the number of 3,773
**uccha**-possible 54."  Compared to a single being, the time of death for many
beings is a very short period. The **utkrista** time is slightly less than half
a **pudgala** change.  **Doubt:** In this way, the time of death for a
**mithyadristi** is also a moment. Why is it not mentioned in the sutra
"**sansarinon muktashcha**"? We will address this later. The time of the
**sasadan** **guna sthana** is one **avali** (compared to a single being, it is
six **avali**s).  **Answer:** It is not correct to say so. There is one
**avali** of **mithyatva** **guna** time. It is said, "The death of a being who
has attained countless **sthana**s occurs in one **avali** of time of the
**antarmuhurt**. The middle of a countable **avali** is impossible. It is said,
"An **ananta anubandhi** has one **ucchavasa**. Seven **ucchavasa**s make one
**visanayojan** for a **vedaka** who is **samyakdristi** and has a **mithyatva**
**stoka**. Seven **stoka**s make one **lava**. When a **guna sthana** is
attained, there are 37.5 **lava**s in one **avali** time. Two **nalis** do not
have the **udaya** of an **ananta anubandhi**, and one **anta** is one
**muhurt**. Thirty **muhurt**s make one day. Death does not occur until the
**muhurt** time. **Samyak** and **mithyadristi** both have a **muhurt** time,
and fifteen days make one **paksha**.  The time of death for a **mithyadristi**
is not a moment because they lose their **guna sthana** when the time of death
arrives. The time of the **asanyata** and **samyata-asanyata** **guna sthana**
is much shorter than the **antarmuhurt** of a single being, and they do not die
until the **muhurt**. Therefore, the **asanyata** and **samyata-asanyata**
**guna sthana** have a longer **antarmuhurt**. The **antarmuhurt** is further
multiplied. This should be understood later.  The time of the **asanyata-
samyakdristi** **guna sthana** is slightly more than 33 **sagara**s compared to
a single being. This is because **kshapika**s and **ayogakevali**s are able to
attain **moksha** and therefore do not die in the **avantar**.  The explanation
is as follows: A being is born with a lifespan of one **purvakoti**. After one
**antarmuhurt**, they attain **samyaktva** and **tapasya**, and are born in
**sarvarthasiddhi**. After leaving there, they are born again with a lifespan of
one **purvakoti**. After eight years, they attain the **ayogakevali** **guna
sthana**. The **utkrista** time is slightly less than one **purvakoti** because
they attain **kevalgyan** after eight years of **tapasya** from birth.
Therefore, there are a few years less in the **purvakoti**.  The time of the
**pramatta** and **apramatta** **guna sthana** is a moment compared to a single
being. This is because all beings first attain the **apramatta** **guna sthana**
due to the influence of specific **parinama**s. After that, they attain the
**pramatta** **guna sthana**, which is its opposite. Therefore, a being in the
**tiryag** **sanayata-samyakdristi** **guna sthana** dies after attaining the
**apramatta** **guna sthana** when one moment remains in their lifespan. After
that, they change their **gati**.  The time of the **tiryag** **asanyata-
samyakdristi** **guna sthana** is a moment compared to a single being. A being
in the **darshan-moha** **kshay** **guna sthana** dies after attaining the
**pramatta** **guna sthana** when one moment remains in their lifespan. After
that, they change their **gati**.  A **vedaka** who is **samyakdristi** and has
one moment remaining in their lifespan is three **palyopamana**s compared to a
**darshan-moha** **kshay** **vedaka**.

Appendix 2 §. 93 A being, having become one-sensed, experiences three hundred
and thirty-one births and deaths, in the highest degree, in comparison to a
single human being with a false view, for a period of forty-seven previous
kotis.  Another comparison:  seventy-four previous kotis, due to the
distinctness of the previous kotis.  The same being, in the middle of that very
moment, experiences more than a koti.  Thus, having become a neuter, female, or
male, with two, three, four, or five senses, it experiences forty-four births
and deaths in the interval between the arising of the lifespan of a previous
koti, in accordance with the number eighty, sixty, forty, and twenty-four, due
to the diversity of its own karma.  All these, when combined, amount to one
hundred and sixty-six thousand three hundred and thirty-six.  It is said: "In
the middle of a moment, eight times are produced the small births and deaths of
a human being who is a small birth.  Again, eight times are produced with a
neuter or female, but seven times with a male.  Then, with a lifespan of three
palya, it is born in the realm of enjoyment.  By rule, those born in the realm
of enjoyment are born in the heavens.  Afterwards, there is a change of destiny.
In the highest degree, in comparison to a single human being with an
unrestrained right view, there are three palya.  For a human being born in the
realm of karma, whether he is endowed with the right view of a destroyer or with
the right view of a destroyer of the knowledge of the veiling of perception, is
born among the human beings of the realm of enjoyment.  Thus, because of not
abandoning the human destiny, there are three palya, in excess, afterwards there
is a change of destiny." [In the human destiny, the time of the false view guna-
sthana, in comparison to a single being, is three palya, in excess, due to the
distinctness of the previous kotis, that is, forty-seven previous kotis.  Its
explanation is as follows:  with a neuter, female, and male, it is born eight
times with a lifespan of a previous koti, and in the interval, within a moment,
it is born eight times with the small birth of a human being who is a small
birth.  Afterwards, it is born again eight times with a neuter or female, but
seven times with a male.  Then, it is born in the realm of enjoyment with a
lifespan of three palya.  Beings born in the realm of enjoyment are born in the
heavens by rule.  Therefore, afterwards, its destiny changes.  In the highest
degree, in comparison to a single being with an unrestrained right view, the
time of the guna-sthana is three palya.  For a human being born in the realm of
karma (bound human lifespan), whether he is endowed with the right view of a
destroyer or with the right view of a destroyer of the knowledge of the veiling
of perception, is born among the human beings of the realm of enjoyment.

Sarvārthasiddhi  In this time period, the one-sensed beings are constantly dying
and being reborn. Some of them, endowed with additional qualities, continue to
take birth again and again through the voice-body or mind-body. Later, at the
end of the time period of the imperfect or the perfect senses, they become
either five-sensed or five-sensed-and-mind.  The transition from wrong belief to
right belief, and the transition of other yogas (activities of the body, speech,
and mind) experienced by them, occurs at the end of the time period of the right
or wrong belief. This is also the case for the ascetics and the quiescent ones.
Regarding the five-sensed being with wrong belief, it should be understood that
the duration of its yoga (activity of the body, speech, and mind) is the
longest, exceeding the duration of the yogas of the other beings by ninety-six
previous infinite time periods. Similarly, the duration of the male, female, and
neuter Vedas is also the longest.  The being with the Vedas is born eight times
with the consciousness of being named, and eight times without the consciousness
of being named, within the duration of one previous infinite time period.  In
the same way, the transition of yoga and the transition of the stages of
spiritual development should be understood for the mobile beings as well, with
the difference that the duration is the shortest, being only one time period,
exceeding the previous infinite time periods by ninety-six.  The transition of
the yoga and the stages of spiritual development for the ascetics and the
quiescent ones should be understood in the same way as for the mind-yogis.

Appendix 2 [405 6. 98 43.8 A single being with false belief and female-knowledge
has a short time period, from the lowest to the inner-moment. Then there is a
transition to another quality. From the highest, there is a time period of one
hundred palya-upam-prthaktva. For example, a being with female-knowledge binds
the lifespan of a deva with false belief. Then, from there, it is born in the
realm of animals and humans. 8. 100 44.8 A single being with false belief and
knowledge of disintegration has a time period of thirty-three oceans, from the
lowest to the highest, compared to a naraka. It is sufficient that then, the
being abandons the female-knowledge. A single being with false belief and
knowledge of disintegration, who is not restrained by female-knowledge, attains
knowledge of disintegration. Therefore, it is sufficient that the inner-moment,
which is the completion of the sufficient time period, is reduced by five
hundred palya-upam, due to the inferiority of the state. Since there is no
production of right belief from female-knowledge, it is sufficient that the
being will attain right belief. The inner-moment, which is the completion of the
sufficient time period, is reduced by the inferiority of the state. [A single
being with false belief and knowledge of disintegration has a time period of
thirty-three oceans, from the highest to the lowest, compared to a naraka.  A
single being with false belief and knowledge of disintegration, who is not
restrained by neuter-knowledge, has a time period of thirty-three oceans in the
seventh earth, from the highest to the lowest, compared to a naraka. It is
sufficient that the being attains knowledge of disintegration. Therefore, it is
sufficient that the inner-moment, which is the completion of the sufficient time
period, is reduced by the inferiority of the state. The being should attain
right belief. [A single being with false belief and female-knowledge has a short
time period, from the lowest to the inner-moment. Then, there is a transition to
another quality.  . 103 45.3 A single being with false belief and knowledge of
black, blue, or pigeon-like color has a short time period, from the lowest to
the inner-moment, compared to animals and humans. There is a possibility of
their color changing. The inner-moment, which is the completion of the
sufficient time period, should be seen as being reduced by the inferiority of
the state, compared to animals and humans. From the highest, there is a time
period of one hundred palya-upam-prthaktva, compared to a naraka. In this way,
the being remains with female-knowledge until the seventh, fifth, and third
earth, up to one hundred palya-upam-prthaktva, excluding naraka and
sammochchana. Then, the being abandons the female-knowledge. A single being with
false belief and knowledge of disintegration, who is not restrained by female-
knowledge, has a time period of seventeen oceans, from the highest to the
lowest, compared to deva and naraka. Due to the inferiority of the state, the
being wanders with the rule of the color. The being wanders with the rule of the
color. There is no rule, therefore, it is excessive. The said color is present.
A single being with false belief and knowledge of disintegration, who is not
restrained by right belief, has a time period of fifty-five palya-upam, from the
highest to the lowest, compared to a naraka. The inner-moment, which is the
completion of the sufficient time period, is reduced by the inferiority of the
state. Since right belief is not produced with female-knowledge, the being with
female-knowledge attains right belief in the sufficient state. Therefore, the
inner-moment, which is the completion of the sufficient time period, is reduced
by the inferiority of the state. (It is reduced by fifty-five palya-upam). A
single being with false belief and knowledge of disintegration, who is not
restrained by right belief, has a time period of two oceans, from the highest to
the lowest, compared to deva, in the first, twelfth, and eighteenth heaven.
Because there is a possibility of the production of the state of maranantika, it
is excessive. A single being with false belief and knowledge of white color has
a time period of thirty oceans, from the highest to the lowest, compared to the
deva of the first, second, and third heaven. The being attains right belief
after resting for some time in the state of maranantika, becoming pure.
Therefore, it is reduced by the inferiority of the state.  8..99 44.5 A single
being with false belief and knowledge of four kashayas, from the beginning of
false belief to the end of apramatta, has a short time period, from the lowest
to the inner-moment, compared to a being with the mind-oriented quality.  [A
single being with false belief and knowledge of black, blue, or pigeon-like
color has a short time period, from the lowest to the inner-moment, compared to

##  [406] **Sarvarthasiddhi** It is possible. There may be a moment of time
(antarmuhūrta) for all beings with leshya. This is not correct, because it is
characterized by a large number of time units. One should look at the
perspective of animals and humans. Due to the excellence of a small number of
time units in an incalculable fraction (āvalikāsaṃkhyeya), the time for hell
beings is seven, five, and three oceans respectively, compared to the time for
gods and humans. For the liberated souls (sayogakevali), the time is thirty-
three oceans, seventeen oceans, and three oceans respectively, compared to
various beings, because they initiate the punishment, etc., at the same time.
The time for the most excellent hell beings is incalculable, because they are in
a state of suffering. When they go to punishment, etc., in a continuous uneven
time, characterized by an incalculable number of time units, they initiate it
with the same leshya. For one being, the time is the least and the most
excellent, but there are no rules for coming from there, so there is some time
that is three times the time for filling two worlds
(prataradvyalokapūraṇalakṣaṇāḥ). The time mentioned is more. For the
unrestrained (asanyata) with right faith (samyagdṛṣṭi), the time is thirty-three
oceans, etc., compared to one being with leshya, because the time for hell
beings is the most excellent, compared to one being with the least excellent
leshya (āhārakāma mithyādṛṣṭi).   There is a moment of time (antarmuhūrta) for
one being, because it is born in a small world (kṣudra bhave) by going in a
crooked path (vakragati), and again goes in a crooked path. It is born and dies
again, going in a crooked path, and does not attain right faith (samyaktva) in
the final annihilation (māranāntika) in the seventh earth. It remains without
food (anāhārak) and becomes a food-eater (āhārak) in the middle. Therefore,
there is some less time mentioned. The incalculable fraction of the incalculable
number of time units of the ascending and descending (utsapiṇī-avasarpiṇī) time
is the measure of the time for the blazing (tejo) and the foot-leshya
(padāleśyā) wrong faith (mithyādṛṣṭi) and the unrestrained (asanyata) with right
faith (samyagdṛṣṭi). The time for one being with the most excellent leshya is
incalculable, compared to the time for one being with the least excellent
leshya, because the measure of doubt (śaṅkā) and āvalikā is incalculable.
Therefore, the time for the first and twelfth heavens is two oceans, compared to
the time for the eighteenth heaven, which is eighteen oceans.   It is not
correct to say that the time for those beings with the mentioned state is
incalculable, because the time for the final annihilation and birth is possible.
Therefore, it is necessary to take some more time mentioned. The measure of time
for the wrong faith (mithyādṛṣṭi) with white leshya (śuklaleśyā) is a small
incalculable number, compared to the time for one being with the most excellent
leshya. The time for the gods of the highest graveya is thirty-one oceans. There
is also white leshya in their final annihilation and birth. Therefore, the time
for the liberated souls (sayogakevali) is some more than thirty-one oceans,
compared to various beings. The time for the restrained (samyata) and the
unrestrained (asanyata) with the qualities of the stages (guṇasthāna) with white
leshya (śuklaleśyā) is three times, compared to one being with the least
excellent leshya, because they initiate the punishment, etc., at the same time.
The time for the qualities of the stages (guṇasthāna) and the change of leshya
(leśyāparivartana) is a medium number, compared to the time for one being with
the most excellent leshya. The time for the unrestrained (asanyata) with the
qualities of the stages (guṇasthāna) is one time, and the time for the most
excellent is a moment of time (antarmuhūrta).   They initiate the punishment,
etc., at different times. The time for the unrestrained (asanyata) with right
faith (samyagdṛṣṭi) is three times, compared to one being, because the time for
the unrestrained (asanyata) with right faith (samyagdṛṣṭi) is the least
excellent, and the time for the most excellent is three times. The time for the
two worlds (pratar) and one world-filling (lokapūraṇa) punishment is one time,
compared to one being with wrong faith (mithyādṛṣṭi). The time for the least
excellent is a moment of time (antarmuhūrta). It is born in a small world
(kṣudra bhave) by going in a crooked path (vakraṇa gataḥ). It goes again in a
crooked path (vakreṇa gataḥ). The incalculable fraction of the incalculable
number of time units of the ascending and descending (utsapiṇī-avasarpiṇī) time
is the measure of the time for the unrestrained (asanyata) with right faith
(samyagdṛṣṭi), because it always goes in a straight path (śaśvadṛjugatimattvāt).
The time for the unrestrained (asanyata) with right faith (samyagdṛṣṭi) is one
time, compared to one being with wrong faith (mithyādṛṣṭi). The time for the
unrestrained (asanyata) with right faith (samyagdṛṣṭi) is sixty-six oceans,
compared to various beings, because the time for the unrestrained (asanyata)
with right faith (samyagdṛṣṭi) is the most excellent. The incalculable fraction
of the āvalikā is one time, because the time for the unrestrained (asanyata)
with right faith (samyagdṛṣṭi) is characterized by a large number of time units.
The time for the unrestrained (asanyata) with right faith (samyagdṛṣṭi) is one
time, because it remains only for that much time. Again, in the middle, the
unrestrained (asanyata) with right faith (samyagdṛṣṭi) is a food-eater (āhārak)
until the moment of time (antarmuhūrta), because it goes in a crooked path
(vakragati) at the beginning and end.

Appendix 2 [407 Until the end of the Antarmahat, he attains Samyamithyatva.
Again, he remains in the state of Vedak Samyaktv for sixty-four Sagars. At the
end of the last Sagar, he attains Mithyatva, as per the Deshon. 48.4 For a
Tiryanch Mithyatva-drishti, the Antarkal for a single Jiva is three Palyopamas,
which is an immeasurable fraction of the Antarkal for a Sasadan Jiva. Palyopamas
are the difference in Antarkal. If someone asks why it is not more, or why it is
not Antarmahat, then the answer is that a Jiva with Vedak Samyaktv is not born
in the Tiryanch realm, because he is eligible to attain Sasadan guna. He is born
in the Dev realm. Therefore, a Mithyatva-drishti who has attained the state of
Tri-Palyopamas, and who is in the state of Aupashamik Samyaktv, is born in the
Bhogabhoomi realm during the time between attaining Mithyatva and attaining
Samyaktv. The Jiva born there is called a Sasadan. His Mithyatva lasts for a
little more than forty-eight days, after which he becomes eligible to attain
Aupashamik Samyaktv. The time it takes to become eligible to attain Vedak
Samyaktv is an immeasurable fraction of the time it takes to become eligible to
attain Aupashamik Samyaktv. This is the rule. Therefore, after that many days
have passed, he attains Samyaktv by abandoning Mithyatva, and he attains the
state of Tri-Palyopamas. If he attains Mithyatva again at the end of his
lifespan, then the Antarkal is less than forty-eight days, because it is less
than the time of gestation and the time remaining after the last forty-eight
days. [Further, Antaraka says that the Antarkal for a Mithyatva-drishti for a
single Jiva is two sixty-four Sagars, which is greater than the Antarkal for a
Tiryanch Mithyatva-drishti, which is three sixty-four Sagars. This is because
the Jiva with Vedak Samyaktv remains for sixty-four Sagars. The Antarkal is
Palyopamas. At the end of the last Sagar, he remains in Mithyatva for a short
time. Thus, the Deshon is two sixty-four Sagars. For a Tiryanch and a Manushya,
the Antarkal is a little more than forty-eight days. As the days pass, the Jiva
becomes eligible to attain Samyaktv. The Antarkal is an immeasurable fraction of
the Palyopamas. Doubt: Why is it not more? Answer: This is not a valid argument,
because a Jiva with Vedak Samyaktv is not born in the Tiryanch realm. He is born
in the Dev realm. Therefore, the Antarkal for a Jiva with Vedak Samyaktv is only
sixty-four Sagars. Doubt: Why is the Antarmahat not the Antarkal? Answer: This
is not a valid argument, because a Jiva with Vedak Samyaktv is not born in the
Tiryanch realm. He is born in the Dev realm. Therefore, the Antarkal for a Jiva
with Vedak Samyaktv is only sixty-four Sagars. Doubt: Why is it not more than
three Palyopamas? Answer: This is not a valid argument, because a Jiva with
Vedak Samyaktv is not born in the Tiryanch realm. He is born in the Dev realm.
Therefore, the Antarkal for a Jiva with Vedak Samyaktv is only sixty-four
Sagars. Doubt: Why is the Antarmahat not the Antarkal? Answer: This is not a
valid argument, because a Jiva with Vedak Samyaktv is not born in the Tiryanch
realm. He is born in the Dev realm. Therefore, the Antarkal for a Jiva with
Vedak Samyaktv is only sixty-four Sagars. 6. 111 49.6 For a Manushya, the
Antarkal for a Sasadan Samyaktv-drishti, a Samyamithyatva-drishti, and an
Asanyat Samyaktv-drishti is three Palyopamas, which is greater than the Antarkal
for a Jiva with the same guna but who is born in a previous Koti. 1. In Dhavala,
5, p. 7, it is said that a Jiva attains Samyamithyatva only when the Antarmahat
time remains in the first sixty-four Sagars. -San. 2. In Dhavala, 5, p. 32, it
is said that the Antarkal for a Jiva with three Palyopamas is two months more
than the time of the first Mahart, and less than the two Antarmahats that are
available at the end of the lifespan. -San.

## Translation:  **408]** **Sarvarthasiddhi**  [In the human realm, a *Sāsādan
Samyagdṛṣṭi*, *Samyagmithyādṛṣṭi*, and a *Ekaindriyajīva* born among the
*Vikaleindriyās* become an *Asanyata Samyagdṛṣṭi* and are reborn in the
*Ekaindriya* realm. In this case, there is an interval. However, when the *Pūrva
Koṭi Pṛthaktva Kāla* has passed, it is possible for the *Guṇasthāna* to change
in the *Pañcendriya* realm born in the *Bhoga Bhūmi*. Therefore, they do. Later,
they take on their own *Guṇasthāna*. In this way, one should consider the
interval between *Mithyātva* etc. and *Samyaktva* etc. as a *Pūrva Koṭi
Pṛthaktva* due to the *Utkarsa* of one being. There is an interval of more than
three *Palya Upama*.]  **8. 114 $ 112** **51.5** The interval between
*Pṛthivīkāyikās* and *Vanaspatikāyikās* is an *Asankhyeya* number of
*Pudalaparāvartās* due to the *Utkarsa* of one being in the *Devagati* with
*Mithyādṛṣṭi*. These are like the *Naraantara Niśatsāgara Upama*. For example, a
being with *Mithyātva* is born among the *Vanaspatikāyikās* and then becomes a
*Pṛthivīkāyikās* etc. due to the *Utkarsa*. The interval is thirty *Sāgaras*
because the time is short. The *Mithyātva* returns at the end of the time
remaining. Otherwise, there would be a change in the *Gati*. This is the
*Deśona*. **50.5** Similarly, the interval between *Vanaspatikāyikās* and
*Pṛthivīkāyikās* etc. is an *Asankhyeya* number of *Lokas* due to the *Utkarsa*.
This is because the time for *Vanaspatikāyikās* to become *Pṛthivīkāyikās* etc.
is short. **8. 115** A *Dravyalinga* *Mithyādṛṣṭi* was born in the
*Uparimaveyak*. Later, he took on *Samyaktva* and remained for thirty *Sāgaras*.
At the end of the time, he became a *Mithyādṛṣṭi* again. **52.3** If this were
not the case, the *Gati* would change. Therefore, *Deśona*. **50.9** There is no
interval between the *Guṇasthānas* of *Kāyavāḍ*, *Manasayogi* etc. with
*Mithyādṛṣṭi* etc. and the *Nānakajīvas*. **8. 113** **Question:** Why is there
no interval with respect to one being? **Answer:** Because the time for
*Kāyādīyoga* is an *Antarmūhūrta Kāla*. Therefore, it is possible for the
*Mithyātva* etc. *Guṇasthāna* of a being residing in *Kāyādīyoga* to change to
another *Guṇasthāna* and then return to the same *Guṇasthāna*. **53.6**
Similarly, there is no interval between *Sāsādan Samyagdṛṣṭi* etc. and one
being. **5. 117** The interval for a *Ekaindriyajīva* to become a *Dve Sāgara
Upama Sahasra Pūrva Koṭi Pṛthaktva* is sixty-nine *Pūrva Koṭis* plus two
thousand *Sāgaras*. **53.6** The word *Pumvede* is used separately for the two
*Kṣapakas*. **50.9** The interval for a *Ekaindriyajīva* to become a *Dve Sāgara
Upama Sahasra Pūrva Koṭi Pṛthaktva* is sixty-nine *Pūrva Koṭis* plus two

two *upasham* practitioners who are *samayik* *chhed* *upasthapan* *shuddhi*
*samyata*, the difference between them is less than a *purvakoti* time period,

difference in *leshya* and then ascends the *shreni* due to the excellence of
the *shamak* practitioner. **[**In *shuklaleshya*, a *samyata* practitioner who

*sukshmasampray* *samyama*, there is no difference for the *upasham*

**57. 10** In the case of those who are not *samyata* in the lowest *gana*, the
difference between them and a *mithyadristi* practitioner is less than thirty-
three *sagars* because a *mithyadristi* practitioner is born in the seventh

*deshon*. **]** There is no difference for the *upashanta* *kshaya* practitioner
because the *upashanta* practitioner is excellent in relation to the *kshaya*
practitioner. The difference in *leshya* is less than a *purvakoti* time period
because a human being with a *purvakoti* lifespan ascends the *shreni* only
after eight years. Having taken on *samyama*, he ascends the *upasham* *shreni*
and falls. In the *pramatta* and *aprammatta* *gunasthanas*, **3.** He remains

days in relation to other beings. **[***Aupashamika* is abundant. In
*sakshmasampray* *samyama*, there is no difference for the *upasham*

*ganasthan*. In the case of those who are not *samyata*, the difference between
a *mithyadristi* practitioner and a *samyata* practitioner is less than thirty-

*purva* *upashamika* practitioner is part of the *shreni* ascension. Having
fallen, he does not ascend the *shreni* with the same *shreni* ascension. He
takes on *samyaktva* after going to *mithyatva*, and then ascends the *shreni*.
Therefore, there is no difference. **8. 124** There is no difference for the
*samana* *samyag* *mithyatva* *mithyatva* practitioner because of the difference
in *leshya*. **57. 1** In the case of *tejo* *padma* *leshya* practitioners who

is no difference for the *yukta* practitioner in relation to other beings

Appendix 2 [411 If any living being takes up the state of  *aupashamik samyaktv*
for three periods of time. If the time of their *gunasthan* does not exceed
that, then there is no taking up for seven nights and days. Therefore, there is
no possibility of a difference from their other *gunasthan*. With *aupashamik
samyaktv*, the difference in time for *sanyata* and *asanyata* is fourteen days,
and for *pramatta* and *aprammatta* it is fifteen days. For one living being,
the minimum difference in time is the minimum *antarmuhurta*, and the maximum is
61.1. The meaning is: the *mithyadristi* is the *audayik* state, and the maximum
difference in time is the maximum *antarmuhurta*. It is said: *Mithyatva
prakruter udaye pradur bhavat*. The difference in time for *sasadan samyaktv*
and *aupashamik samyaktv* is seven days, *Dristiriti parinamik bhavah*. Now,
with *ananta anubandhi aupashamik samyaktv*, the difference in time for *virata*
and *avirata* is fourteen days, and for *virata* it is fifteen days. *Krodhady
daye'sya pradur bhavad idayiktvam kasman nochyata* Why is it not said that this
is *audayik* due to the arising of *krodha* etc.? *iti cet, avivakshitvat*. It
is only necessary to know the days in relation to *darshan moha*.
*Mithyadristiyadi gunasthan chatushtaye bhavo nirupyitum upashanta kshaya ka ek
jiva ke prati antar nahin hai*. It is intended to explain the four *gunasthan*
of *mithyadristi* etc. Therefore, there is no difference for one living being in
*sasadan samyaktv*, *samyak mithyatva*, and both of these, because the living
being ascends the *upasham shreni* with *aupashamik samyaktv*, which arises from
*vedak samyaktv*, and the three types of *darshan moha* - arising, destruction,
and the appearance of destruction-pacification. *Vat parinamiktvam*. The *samyak
mithyadristi* is the *kshayopashamik* state. When it falls from that, it does
not ascend the *shreni* of the same *samyaktv* again, but takes up another
*samyaktv*. *Nanu sarvaghatinam udya bhaave desha aaroha nahin karta kintu anya
samyaktvako grahan ghatinam chodaye ya utpadyate bhavah sa kshayopashamik*. It
does not ascend the *shreni* by taking up another *samyaktv* or by going into
*mithyatva* and then taking up *samyaktv* again, because the *samyak mithyatva
prakrti* cannot be *desha ghatit*. *Na cha samyamithyatva prakrter desha
dhatitvam sambhavati, karake tab shrenipar aaroha karta hai*. Therefore, there
is no difference in it. *Atah usaka sarvaghatitvena agame tasyah pratipaditvat
iti*. It is established that it is *sarvaghatit* in the *agame*. *Tada antar
nahin hai*. There is no difference in that. *Sasadan samyaktv, samyak mithyatva
yuktam, upcharatastasya desha ghatitvasya api sambhavat*. It is appropriate that
*sasadan samyaktv* and *samyak mithyatva* are connected, because it is possible
for it to be *desha ghatit* by convention. *Aur mithyatvase yukta ek jiva ke
prati antar nahin hai*. There is no difference for one living being connected
with *mithyatva*. *Upchar nimittam cha deshata samyaktvasy ghatitvam, na hi*. It
is *desha ghatit* by convention, because the *samyaktv* is not destroyed by the
*mithyatva* in the same *gunasthan*, because the *mithyatva* of a living being
situated in the *gunasthan* of *sadan* etc. cannot be different from the
*gunasthan* of *samyak mithyatva* (the form of *samyaktv*). *Mithyatva
prakrtivat samyag mithyatva prakritya sarvasya dan adi gunasthaname sthita jiva
ka mithyatva samyag mithyatva swarupasy (samyaktv swarupasy) ghatah adi
gunasthanase antar asambhav hai*. It is possible that there is a liking for the
truth taught by the *sarvagna*. *Sambhavati sarvagna upadisht tatveshu
ruchyanshasya api sambhavat*. *Tada upadisht tatveshu ruchy ruchyatmako hi
parinamh*. The result is liking or disliking for the truth taught. 8. 130
*Samyag mithyatvam iti*. 59. 13. There is no difference for *asangni* in
relation to *nanak jiva*. *[Ab bhaavaka kathana karte hain - mithyadristi yah ek
mithyatva gunasthanavati tvana tesham sasadinan tara sambhavat*. Now, the
*bhaavaka* say: *mithyadristi* is an *audayik* state because it is possible for
it to be *mithyatva gunasthanavati*. *Hota hai. Sasadan samyak dristi yah
parinamik bhavah*. It happens. *Sasadan samyak dristi* is a *parinamik* state.

## 414] **Sarvarthasiddhi**  There is no contradiction in the statement in 8.275
that the souls connected with the pudgala dravya are not called 'rupa' (form).
Because even there, they are called so.  It is said:  119.3 "There is no change
in the non-karmic (pudgala) dravya." - The generous and changing pudgalas are
suitable for the three bodies, the aharasarira, the indriyasarira, the
pranasarira, and the six perfections of speech, mind, and non-mind. These
pudgalas are taken by one soul at one time, with the qualities of being smooth,
etc., intense, slow, and medium. The explanation of their ability to give
results and their nature. Because of their short duration, they are in their
respective states, intense, etc., and remain, being non-karmic, experience the
result, and are abandoned. Later, at some time, they are not taken as the three
bodies, etc. They are the same, in the object - soul, etc., in many souls, in
many forms. There is no contradiction, because of the non-transgression of
perception, because of the argumentation of the dravya, because of the
argumentation of the synonym of the dravya, because of the eternal nature of the
special object, etc. The practice of attaining the true nature, the business of
showing the nature as it is, the nayas, take, take, and abandon, in between, the
previous mixed ones, and the object-one-place-grasping of the knower's
intention. It is said: "Not counting the ones not taken, as long as they are
infinite, then, once, in the middle, the mixed ones are abandoned, taking the
ones taken. Again, the ones not taken are abandoned, taking them infinitely.
Again, once, the mixed ones are abandoned, until the mixed ones are infinite,
then, once, the ones taken are abandoned, taking them. By this method, by the
movement of the arga, by the infinite mixed ones, taking, taking, and abandoning
the ones taken, until they are infinite, then, the ones first taken, by the same
smooth, etc., intense, etc., type, attain the same non-karmic state, until then,
the change of the non-karmic dravya is said to be complete. That is the half-
pudgala-cycle. The change of the karmic dravya is the samsara.  The karmic
dravya destroys the multi-state karma. It is said that it exceeds the time of
the aavali, which is more than the time of the stimulation, which is the
characteristic of the unripe and ripe. The process is to be seen as before.
"The bondage is the characteristic of the knowledge, because of that, the
knowledge is. Therefore, the non-arising is the characteristic of the souls." -
Naigama ... 113311  "The intellect is the proof of the many forms of meaning,
the part of the intellect is the meaning. The nayas are dependent on other
meanings, the bad nayas are rejected because of that." - The meaning that is not
abandoned is the meaning that is not produced. Because of the increasingly
subtle subject matter. From the Naigama, the collection is of a small subject
matter, because of the grasping of only the being, the Naigama is of a large
subject matter, because of the subject matter of being and non-being. Just as
there is a concept in the being, there is also a concept in the non-being.
Similarly, it is to be applied here. The meaning is only a small part of the
purpose.  Thus ends the first chapter.  trafacarat ... 11111  §. 276  119.13
Change of field. The infinite, limited, plant-like, ordinary body, food, breath,
exhalation, death, and birth are all mixed together. The subtle, insufficient,
special characteristic of the poet is for the purpose of explaining the lowest
level of understanding. Because of their mutual rapid non-being and being, they
are all specially characterized as the lowest level of body. Such a soul is born
in the middle region of the eight lokas, in the shape of a cow's udder, below
Mount Meru, making the middle region of its body the middle region. If it is
said that the body of the lowest level of understanding is contrary to the eight
regions, then it is not so, because the body extends to the infinite space

Appendix 2 And again, by the same all-pervading body-world, the middle region is
entered twice, and continuously. Not counting those arising elsewhere or there,
or those arising by entering the boundary, thus three times, and four times, and
so on, until the extent of the expansion, elevation, and entry is reached: the
number of spaces measured by the countless parts of an angula of square
expansion, for that many times, arising there, and then, by the abandonment of
the previously occupied field, entering a new region, and so on, all the worlds
are pervaded. Now, if it is said that this measure of the world would be that
body, then no, because of the acceptance of the pervading by the abandonment of
the previously pervaded space. That §. 277 120.5 Change of Time. First, second,
etc., the ghee arises in the first, second, etc., times, until the ghee of the
measure of a koti of kotis, equal to ten oceans, is completed. So also the ghee
of that measure. Thus, the continuity of death is also to be known. The arising
and death of the arising in succession are not counted. §. 279 121.6 Change of
State. The nature of the veil of knowledge is primary, and with reference to it,
it is said. The false view, distinguished by the five senses, etc., destroys all
the most wretched states, and that is called its own appropriate state. It is
called a koti of kotis, equal to an ocean, a middle koti of kotis, and a koti of
kotis. The places of the passions and their activities are limited by the
measure of countless worlds, and are six places, which are of the form of
infinite part increase, countless part increase, countless part increase,
countless quality increase, countless quality increase, and infinite quality
increase. Those who have fallen into them have gone through that increase and
increase. By this, their decrease and increase is indicated. Those places of the
passions and their activities, thus being, become appropriate for that false-
view-being to dwell in. Among them, the most wretched place of the passions and
their activities is extremely slow, and the place of the passions and their
activities appropriate for liberation is excellent, and their nature is such
that there is no difference between them in regard to the work of dwelling. That
place of the passions and their activities, which makes such a state, makes
various experiences of the power of giving fruit to karmas, and the
characteristics of experience, and is called the cause of them. 'Joga
payadipadesa dvidianubhaga kasayado  [415 kunadi' - by this statement.
Therefore, that very place, endowed with special powers of wretchedness, makes
countless worlds of experience and activity places. This triad, the most
wretched, thus wandering about as the doer, becomes the most wretched place of
yoga, appropriate for it, and conducive to it. And since the yoga, etc., are of
the duration of an antarmūhūrta, etc., they take on another yoga, another
passion, and sometimes, in a particular time, from the first most wretched place
of yoga, they become the second place of yoga, endowed with countless part
increase, which is related to their most wretched state, etc. Thus, they fall
into four places. They are led by the increase of the four places, other than
the infinite part, infinite quality increase, until they become countless part
measured. Thus, with the most wretched experience and activity places being
countless part measured in the places of yoga, the second experience and
activity place of the one with the most wretched state and the place of the
passions and their activities becomes. Its places of yoga also fall into four
places. They are to be known as countless part measured, as before. Thus, in the
third, etc., experience places, this order is to be known until the completion
of countless worlds. Thus, the second place of the passions and their activities
becomes, which is attaining that very most wretched state. Its experience and
activity places are also countless world measured, and each is endowed with
countless part measured places of yoga, which have fallen into four places, and
are to be known as before. In the said most wretched state, the excellent state,
which increases in succession at each moment, is to be known as three hundred
ocean-like koti of kotis measured, and the places of the passions, experience,
and yoga are to be known in the order described. §. 284 The wandering being is
afraid........।।12।। 124.5 Because of being desired, because of being worthy of
worship. 8. 285 124.7 Dividing in succession, transgressing in succession. §.
286 124.10 The fourfold nature of the earth, etc., is stated in the scriptures.
Thus, Puḍavī pṛḍavīkāo puḍavīkāyā ya puḍavījīvā ya. Sāhāranopa-mukko

qualities of being a minister and an assistant. This is because they are capable
of producing effects like form, etc. Touch, taste 112311 Form... 11511 §. 535

in the previous case, there are countless regions of the dharma, etc., from the
lowest to the highest, so also in the case of space, there is the concept of

corporeal, by means of a thief, fear, etc., is an obstruction, a restraint. The
corporeal, the ear, is also obstructed by noise, etc., resulting in deafness,
etc. The corporeal, by means of unfavorable wind, is the obstruction of sound,
the intended going, the turning back. The overpowering of the ear, the ability
to produce the perception of sound immediately, is destroyed by the sound of a
bell, etc. By means of a strong wind, the sound and its production [419 The
ability to destroy is destroyed by the sound of a drum, etc., by a mosquito,

innumerable, and infinite. ... Sound bond 11411 §. 570 224.12 The non-verbal
nature of the two senses, etc., is the reason for the superior knowledge of the
one sense. Thus, there is a specific knowledge of sound for those who are well-
versed in sound, because it is not possible to have a sound organ. The one-
sensed beings, however, have only knowledge, not superior knowledge, because
they do not have a sound organ. Or, superior knowledge is pure knowledge, and it
is the reason for its own nature. The one who has superior knowledge is the one
who conveys meaning by means of non-verbal sound. But he who is not, is not so,
just as a man on a road. It is said, "The sound that is lost is the one that has
a letter." Thus, the cloud that is a whirlwind. The lotus, the drum. The city,
the disease (?) The loud sound, the Kinnara. The resin, the witness Production

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):  Sarvarthasiddhi This vessel
(bhanda) brings great benefit, surpassing even speech and breath control
(vagyoga) practices. Thus, the bodily activities (kayyoga) are of three types:
audarika, vaikriyika, and karmana.  The pure (shuddha) eightfold (ashtaka) is
marked by purity. What then is the eightfold? It is the dual (ubhaya) -
abstinence from speech, body, and begging, and the opposite - improper speech,
body, and begging, which establish discipline and decorum.  It is characterized
by the activity of displaying the vessel (bhandimapradarshaka-karyavyapara).
Elsewhere, it is ridiculous (upahsaniye) for other living beings.  Due to the
digestive fire (jatharagnivashaat), the one without hands (ahasta) and without
arms (abahu) - due to the delusion (mithyadarshanaagrahat), hunger-afflicted
(kshudabhyaadatattvaat) - the one with passions (sakashaya) is made, by a single
act (avibhagena ekakaarena).  The liquid (dravo), the invigorating (vrshya), and
the intoxicating (abhishava) - the liquid is the rice porridge soaked for three
watches of the night. The invigorating is that which increases the strength of
the senses. The one with passions subsided (aparinada), the one with passions
exhausted (ucchinṇa) - the improperly cooked (dushpakva) causes abdominal pain,
so its consumption is not recommended. This is the solution.  Regarding the
karmic merit (satkarmapekshaya), the one without desire (nirutsuka) and with
unobstructed natural inclination (shubhaparinama-niruddhasvaram) - how can it be
a transgression (atichara)? Thus.  The bodily completion (shariranirvarttiḥ) -
the procedure (vidhi) of acceptance (pratigraha), etc. The eight limbs
(ashtavangani) are mentioned. The pure conduct (punna) is of nine types, as
stated.  The ear, nose, eye, upper and lower lips, etc. are the subsidiary limbs
(upanga). The banyan tree (nyagrodha), the ant-hill (svati), the uninterrupted
structure (hundasamsthanam), and the cicada (asapātikā) are mentioned.  The
self-made noose (svayamkrtodvandha), the six classes of living beings
(shatkaayaḥ), the four ways of death (marutpatana), and the restraint of the
breath (prāṇāpātanirodhanam) are described.

Appendix 2 [423 6. 755 The maximum body size of the infinite-bodied beings is
one ocean, twenty-five oceans, fifty oceans, one hundred oceans 305.13. And it
should be known that the duration of existence is one thousand oceans. As
stated: The meaning is that the sentient five-sensed complete beings have the
following characteristics: they consume food, take in water and air, and have a
general body. The maximum duration of the binding of the deluding karmic matter
is seventy general beings. This is the general characteristic. However, the
maximum duration of the single-sensed complete beings is one ocean, of the two-
sensed complete beings is twenty-five oceans, of the three-sensed complete
beings is fifty oceans, of the four-sensed complete beings is one hundred
oceans, and of the non-sentient five-sensed complete beings is one thousand
oceans. The specification of the divisions: Sixth specification. Through the
classification, the maximum duration of the knowledge-obscuring, perception-
obscuring, feeling, and obstructive karmas of these beings is also known. The
maximum duration of these karmas is thirty koṭākoṭi oceans. Therefore, by
dividing thirty koṭākoṭi oceans by seventy, the maximum duration of the karmas
of the aforementioned beings is obtained by multiplying one, twenty-five, fifty,
one hundred, and one thousand. The same duration applies to the incomplete state
of these beings, where the maximum duration of the single-sensed beings is one
ocean less than the asaṃkhyāta (innumerable) part of a palya, and the maximum
duration of the two-sensed and other beings is proportionately less by the
counted part of a palya. It is also stated: This is the duration of the
incomplete state of the single-sensed, two-sensed, and non-sentient complete
beings. The duration of the sentient incomplete beings should be known to be
less by the asaṃkhyāta (innumerable) and saṃkhyāta (countable) parts of a palya.

## 424] **Sarvarthasiddhi**  The highest state of **Mohaniya Karma** for other
beings and **Vikalendriya** beings should be known according to the **Purva Koti
Praman** and **Ayuk** **Agam**. They bind in this way. Later they are born in
**Videha** etc. The highest state of **Mohaniya** for **Ekendriya** etc. beings
is one **Sagar**, twenty-five **Sagar**, fifty **Sagar**,  ...18111 **Sagar**
and one thousand **Sagar**. It is special that in this state of **Mohaniya**,
one should multiply by seven and divide by seven. For **Aparaptak** beings, the
subtle **Samparaya**...  The remaining part of the sentence is: The said state
is less than the **Palya** by an innumerable part and a countable part, as
before. **Vipaka**...1121 6. 774 **Vishtirnama**...||6|| 311.12
**Matigyanavarana** by one's own mouth, **Matigyanavarana** 8.765 in the form
of. By another's mouth, it is also enjoyed in the form of **Shrutagyanavarana**.
310.2 For others, as per the **Agam** - the state of the four  8.775 **Karma
Prakruti** mentioned earlier is not threefold but twofold. Therefore, **Nama**
and **Gotra** should be done. The rest is as before. 312.1 **Prasankhyata** is
meaningful. **A Prasankhyata** is meaningless. [That is, for the **Paraptak**
**Ekendriya** being, the highest state of **Nama** and **Gotra Karma** is two
parts out of seven parts of one **Sagar**.  ...||22|| For the **Paraptak**
**Dwiendriya** being,  6. 776 it is two parts out of seven parts of twenty-five
**Sagar**. For the **Paraptak** **Triendriya** being, it is two parts out of
seven parts of fifty **Sagar**. 312.3 **Darshan Shakti Uparodha** - **Darshan
Shakti Prachhada** is the part. For the **Paraptak** **Chaturindriya** being, it
is two parts out of seven parts of one hundred **Sagar**. For the **Asangyi**
**Panchendriya** **Paraptak** being, it is two parts out of seven parts of one
thousand **Sagar**.  Therefore...12311 6. 778 The lowest state should be known
as less than the **Palya** by an innumerable part and a countable part, as
before. 312.9 **Jati Vishesh Avani** in **Sanskrit**. **Anubhavodaya Avali**
stream, **Anubhavodaya Avali** three...171 flow. 6. 767 **Nama Pratyaya**-12411
310.6 For the rest, from the **Agam**, thus - for the **Asangyi**, 6. 780 the
state of **Ayush** is an innumerable part of the **Palya Upam**, the
**Tiryansangyi** binds **Ayush** in **Swarga** or **Naraka** for an innumerable
part of the **Palya Upam**. 315.3 **Nama Pratyaya** are the cause of **Karma**.
The **Pudgala** who starts **Karma** for the **Ekendriya** and **Vikalendriya**
beings, according to the **Purva Koti Praman**, later **Videha**... are done,
not others. Beings who are in the state of **Ekkshetra Avagaha** are attached,
that is the meaning. They arise. **Pancharasa** - **Madhura Rasa** includes
**Lavana Rasa**. Touch... [For the **Asangyi** **Panchendriya** **Paraptak**
being, how are there four touches due to the eightfold nature of **Ayuk Karma**?
This is not acceptable, because **Sheetoshna Sparsha** etc. do not have co-
existence with their opposites. Therefore, the **Asangyi** binds **Ayush** in
**Swarga** or **Naraka** for an innumerable part of the **Palya Upam**. For the
**Ekendriya** This is the eighth chapter.

##  Command 113611 §. 890 354.8 After the illustration of the reason, in the
absence of the illustration of the reason. Due to faith in the profound meaning
- due to faith in the aggregate of objects that are beyond the reach of our
understanding, especially all the particulars. They are turned away, they are
turned away from the other side. One-based *** 114111 900 358.15 By one who has
attained the knowledge of the scriptures, by the end of the knowledge of the
scriptures. ##  Thought 114411 Appendix 2 §. 906 358.15 The subtle nature of the
substance is the substance atom. The subtle nature of the synonym is the synonym
atom. Like the enthusiasm of a child who is not satisfied - like the enthusiasm
of a child who is not capable. The root and the wool - with the subtle greed
that is the cause of it. Unblemished - spotless. The sky - the ray. The cloud
cage obstruction - the covering of the cloud layer. The ray of Dharma is the
sun. The special activity of the excess of the use of the self. Special making -
where there are special tools like the staff and the door. The helper of the
Samayika - the Samayika, as the known conduct, is the helper of whom. ##  Pulāka
§. 910 363.6 Due to the resemblance of impure Pulāka - due to the resemblance of
impure rice. Unseparated family - uncontrolled family. Both are complete - the
qualities of the root and the end are complete. Like the staff line - like the
staff line. Emerging - arising. ##  Self-control ... 114711 §. 912 364.5 Anuyoga
- question.  8.913 364.9 The ten-part earth with unbroken letters - the ten-part
earth is complete, even with letters, there are no fewer ones, so it is said. §.
913 364.11 The eighth is the mother of the discourse, the five-committee three-
secret-expounding Agam. [427 8.914 364.12 Due to the opposition of the five root
qualities and the avoidance of night meals - due to the opposition of others.
Thinking that this is for the benefit of the Śrāvaka, etc. Serving one of the
others, he opposes. If you ask how to oppose the avoidance of night meals, then
he who feeds the student, etc., at night becomes an opponent. §. 914 364.14 Body
purification - anointing, rubbing, etc. §. 917 365.6 All six of the Bakusha-
serving and the Kusīla. How are the three, from the black speck, etc., of these
two? It is said that due to the possibility of attachment to the tools of these
two, occasional painful meditation is possible. And with painful meditation, the
three, from the black speck, etc., are possible. The four later ones of the
Kṣaya-Kusīla are the pigeon speck, and by the same principle mentioned above,
they should be understood, because even that one has only the attachment of the
object due to the presence of the inner Kṣaya, which is only the burning. 8. 919
365.12 Those caused by Kṣaya are called those caused by Kṣaya because they are
different due to the absence of the lowest level of Kṣaya. Among those, in the
countless, human-limited, restrained places, the most despicable are the places
of attainment - the restrained places. Thus ends the ninth chapter. ##  From the
destruction of delusion m1m §. 9.21 367.12 Now, the conduct before the action
that has not begun. Or, now, the action that has not begun - the meaning is that
the action that has not begun is called a special transformation. What are they?
If you ask, it is said - in one, in one time, for each living being,

## Chapter 10:   **4281** **Sarvarthasiddhi**  The results are limited by the
number of realms recognized. There, due to the absence of specific designation,
the state of being completely free from all negligence, "I am completely free
from all negligence," and so on, is the same as the state of being completely
free from all negligence, as described in the *Riju Sutra* and other scriptures,
in the form of Samayika, in the previous time. Then, in the subsequent times,
there is attainment through the five *Asamantahar* paths and the four *Parihar*
paths. The specific conduct that is practiced, or the knowledge that is self-
evident, is the power of the self. The *Riju Sutra* path is the only one that is
*kevala* (absolute). The *Abhinava Shubha Abhisandhi* (new auspicious intention)
is the *Dharmya Shukla Dhyana Jnana* (righteous white meditation knowledge), and
the *Vyavahar* path is the *Matishruta Jnana* (knowledge of the scriptures) that
is acquired later. The *Kshaya Ashtaka* (eight passions) and the *Ananta
Anubandhi Kshaya Chatushta* (four passions with infinite consequences) are the
three *Matishruta Avadhi Jnana* (knowledge of the scriptures, clairvoyance, and
knowledge of the past). The *Madhyama Kshaya Ashtaka* (eight middle passions) is
taken because the *Matishruta Manahparyaya Jnana* (knowledge of the scriptures,
telepathy, and knowledge of the mind) has already been destroyed. Or, there is
attainment through the four *Matishruta Avadhi Manahparyaya Jnana* (knowledge of
the scriptures, clairvoyance, telepathy, and knowledge of the mind). Due to the
division of *Badara Krisht* (the state of being bound by karma), there is a
difference in the *Sthula Karma Paryaya* (gross karma). The *Upaya* (means) is
the *Matishruta* (knowledge of the scriptures) that is present before and then
only produced later, and the *Phal* (fruit) is the *Abhaya* (fearlessness) that
is destroyed, and the remaining *Uddharit Sesha* (remaining residue) is the
*Upahata Shakti* (weakened power) that is attained. This is applicable
everywhere. It is said, "Karma is called *Krisht* (bound)." It is like *Dhrita
Krisht* (bound by karma). It is of two types, due to the alternative to
*Badara*. "The *Badara* is like a *Kitti* (bird) that is bound by the
*Pachhayader* (shadow) and the *Siddh Dagati Gachvana* (attainment of the path
of the liberated). It is called *Suham Kitti* (happy bird)." The *Avatari
Mohaniya Bhar* (burden of delusion that is manifested) is the *Sphutit Mohaniya
Bhar* (burden of delusion that is shattered). The *Aprat Vibhuti Vishesh*
(unmanifested special power) is the *Achintya Vibhuti Mahatmya*
(incomprehensible greatness of power).  **Ardha Chaturtha Ratna** (half-fourth
jewel)  Thus, one who is sixteen years old and seven *Hasta* (cubits) tall will
be the size of a half-fourth jewel at the eighth month of pregnancy. And he will
have *Makti* (power). Similarly, there is also a division of time, etc. There is
also a difference in the *Kalagati Linga* (time, movement, and sign). There,
time is of three types: *Utsapini* (ascending), *Avasapini* (descending), and
*Anutsapini Avasarpini* (non-ascending, descending). There, everywhere, the
*Anyaparinamik Bhava Sattwa Vastutva Amurta Stoka* (unmanifest particles of the
state of being, essence, reality, and form) are *Utsapini Siddha* (attained in
the ascending time). The *Avasarpini Siddha* (attained in the descending time)
are more due to their special qualities. The *Anutsapini Avasarpini Siddha*
(attained in the non-ascending, descending time) are countless. Elsewhere, in
comparison to the *Riju Sutra* path, there is no difference in the number of
*Siddha* (liberated) at one time. In comparison to the *Riju Sutra* path, there
is no difference in the number of *Siddha* (liberated) in terms of movement. In
comparison to the *Vyavahar* path, there is a *Avashesha* (residue) -
*Avasthiti* (state). Then, in the subsequent human movement, there is no
difference in the number of *Siddha* (liberated). It is said that there is a
difference in the number of *Siddha* (liberated) in the *Ekant Raga* (absolute
attachment). It is said that there are *Stoka* (particles) everywhere due to
previous practice. The *Sthira Yoni Antaragati Siddha* (liberated who move from
one realm to another in the stationary realm), the *Manushya Yoni Antaragati
Siddha* (liberated who move from one realm to another in the human realm) are
countless. The *Naraka Yoni Antaragati Siddha* (liberated who move from one
realm to another in the hell realm) are countless. The *Deva Yoni Antaragati
Siddha* (liberated who move from one realm to another in the heaven realm) are
countless. The *Hetvartha Pushkala* (purpose of the cause is abundant) is also
*Heturupa* (form of the cause). In comparison to the *Riju Sutra* path, there is
no difference in the number of *Siddha* (liberated) who do not know. The
*Aviddha* (unbroken) ... The *Vyavahar* path is the *Sarvata Stoka* (particles
everywhere), the *Napumsaka Veda Siddha* (liberated who know the knowledge of
the neuter gender), the *Stri Veda Siddha* (liberated who know the knowledge of
the female gender), and the *Pum Veda Siddha* (liberated who know the knowledge
of the male gender) are countless. It is said, "Twenty *Navansaya Veda*
(knowledge of the twenty-nine parts) and *Tho Veda* (knowledge of the three
parts) become forty. The *Adadala Pum Veda* (unbroken knowledge of the male
gender) are attained at one time." The *Pratyutpanna* (immediately produced) is
the *Riju Sutra* (straight path). The *Bhuta Anugraha T

## Prashasti:  **A reservoir of knowledge, pure as water, a collection of gems,
a sea of scriptures including the principles of conduct, the great teacher, Shri
Padmanandi Prabhu.**  **From his disciple, Prabhachandra, arose a clear
exposition of the essence of the Tattvartha Sutra, a work dedicated to the
highest teachings.**  **May Prabhachandra, the disciple of Shri Padmanandi, a
repository of many virtues, live long, devoted to the feet of his revered
teacher.**  **The moon among sages, Nandi, adorned his own abode of bliss. His
form, emanating nectar, brings joy to all beings.**  **Thus ends the Tattvartha
Sutra commentary.**  **This work was written by me, 'En Nemiraje', residing in
Venupure (Jannamoodi Vidi). It was completed on the seventh day of the Kartik
month, Raktakshi Samvat.**

Siddhāntācārya Paṇḍit Phūlchandr Śāstrī (1601-1962) was a renowned scholar in
the field of Jain philosophy and principles, known for his multifaceted
knowledge. He was deeply involved in contemplation, literary pursuits, and
played a significant role in national and social upliftment movements. He even
faced imprisonment during the Quit India Movement. Paṇḍitjī was a discerning
interpreter of the essence of the Āgamas. He fearlessly led the movement to
revive the fading brilliance of Jain philosophy, rooted in the principle of non-
violence, and to unveil its benevolent public form for decades. Born in Silāvan,
a small village near Lalitpur (U.P.), Paṇḍitjī influenced a long lineage of
disciples through his successful teaching roles in various institutions. He was
also associated with the Hindu University, Varanasi, as a religious teacher. He
captivated the scholarly world with his profound knowledge in numerous
discussions on philosophy, principles, and conduct.   **Original Works:**  1.
Jain Tattvamīmāṁsā 2. Jain Dharma aur Varṇa-Vyavasthā 3. Viśvaśānti aur
Aparigrahavāda 4. Varṇa, Jāti aur Dharma  **Edited Works:**  Over fifty,
including numerous volumes of Dhavalā and Jayadhavalā, Prameyralamālā,
Pañcādhȳāyī, Mahābandha, Samyasāra-Kalaśa, Labdhisāra-Kṣapaṇāsāra, Ātmānuśāsana,
and other prominent texts of Āgama literature.
