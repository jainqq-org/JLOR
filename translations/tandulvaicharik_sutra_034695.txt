## Agam Sutra 28, Payanna Sutra-5, 'Tandulavaicharik'

**Sutra**
[28] This 'Tandula Veyali' Payanna, I will speak, after paying homage to the Jineswar Mahavir, who is free from old age and death.

**Sutra-1**
[28] This 'Tandula Veyali' Payanna, I will speak, after paying homage to the Jineswar Mahavir, who is free from old age and death.

**Sutra-2**
Human lifespan is considered to be 100 years, which is divided into ten parts. The time period before these 100 years is called 'Garbhavas' (gestation).

**Sutra-3**
The 'Ahar Vidhi' (diet regimen) refers to the time spent in the womb, including the days, nights, Muhurta (a unit of time), and breaths taken by the Jiva (living being) during gestation.

**Sutra-4**
A Jiva stays in the womb for 270 full days and nights, and half a day. This is the standard time for a Jiva to remain in gestation.

**Sutra-5**
However, due to 'Upghat' (adverse conditions), the birth can occur earlier or later than this standard time.

**Sutra-6**
Normally, a Jiva stays in the womb for 8325 Muhurta, but there can be variations in this duration.

**Sutra-7**
A Jiva takes 31410225 breaths in the womb, but this number can be less or more.

**Sutra-9**
O Ayushman! Below the navel of a woman, there are two veins like the stem of a flower.

**Sutra-10**
Below these veins, there is a Yoni (vagina) shaped like an inverted lotus, resembling a sword sheath.

**Sutra-11**
Inside this Yoni, there is a fleshy mass like an 'Am' (mango) fruit. During menstruation, it bursts and releases blood particles. When this inverted lotus-shaped Yoni mixes with Shukra (semen), it becomes capable of producing a Jiva. This is what the Jinenndra has said.

**Sutra-12**
In a Yoni capable of producing a Jiva, more than a lakh of separate Jivas reside for 12 Muhurta. Later, they perish.

**Sutra-13**
After 55 years, a woman's Yoni becomes incapable of conceiving, and after 75 years, a man usually becomes devoid of Shukra (semen).

## Agam Sutra 28, Payannasutra-5, 'Tandulavaicharik'
Sutra Sutra-14
A being has a lifespan of 100 years multiplied by a koti (10 million). After half of this lifespan, a woman becomes incapable of producing offspring. And when 20% of the lifespan remains, a man becomes devoid of sperm. Sutra-15
The womb of a woman with abundant blood is capable of producing a lakh (100,000) distinct beings as offspring in 12 muhurts (48 minutes). In a maximum gestation period of 12 years, a being can have a maximum of shat (200 to 900) distinct fathers. Sutra-16
The right side of the womb is the dwelling place of a male being, and the left side is the dwelling place of a female being. A being dwelling in the middle is a eunuch. In the case of a Tiryanch (non-human) womb, the ideal gestation period is considered to be eight years. Sutra-17
Certainly, this being is born in the womb from the union of the mother and father. It first feeds on the mother's menstrual blood and the father's semen, along with their impurities and sins. Sutra-18
In the first week, the being is in the form of a liquid, in the second week it is like solidified yogurt, then it becomes like flexible muscle, and then it becomes solid. Sutra-19
After that, in the first month, it is like swollen flesh, and in the second month, it becomes dense like a lump of flesh. In the third month, it causes the mother to have cravings. In the fourth month, it nourishes the mother's breasts. In the fifth month, the five limbs - hands, feet, and head - are formed. In the sixth month, bile and blood are formed. And then the remaining limbs and organs are formed. In the seventh month, 700 veins, 500 muscles, nine arteries, and 99 lakh (9.9 million) pores for hair are formed, except for the head and mouth. Three and a half crore (35 million) hair follicles are formed, including the hair on the head and beard. In the eighth month, it is almost complete. Sutra-20
O Bhagavan! Does the fetus have excrement, urine, phlegm, mucus, vomit, bile, semen, or blood? This meaning is not appropriate, i.e., it does not happen. O Bhagavan! Why do you say that the fetus does not have excrement, etc., blood? Gautama! The fetus feeds on the mother's body. It is transformed into bones, marrow, hair, mustache, hair, and nails as the senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. Therefore, it is said that the fetus does not have excrement, etc., blood. Sutra-21
O Bhagavan! Is the fetus capable of taking food through its mouth? O Gautama! This meaning is not appropriate. O Bhagavan! Why do you say so? O Gautama! The fetus takes food from all sides. It is transformed from all sides. It breathes in and out from all sides. It continuously takes food and is transformed. It always breathes in and out. The being takes food and is transformed quickly. It breathes in and out quickly. There is a vein connected to the mother's body that touches the son's body, which is the receiver of the mother's body's essence and the collector of the son's life essence. Therefore, as it takes food, it is transformed. The son's...

## Sutra

**Aagam Sutra 28, Payannasutra-5, 'Tandulavaicharik'**

There is a vein connected to the body of the 'Tandulavaicharik' fetus and touching the mother's body. The fetus, capable of being in the womb, does not take food through the mouth. Sutra - 22

O Bhagavan! What kind of food does the fetus consume? O Gautam! The fetus consumes the essence of whatever the mother eats, like various kinds of sweet, bitter, spicy, and sour substances. The fetus has a navel like the stalk of a fruit or the stem of a lotus. The vein that absorbs the essence is connected to the mother's navel. The fetus consumes the essence through this vein and grows, eventually being born. Sutra - 23

O Bhagavan! How many maternal organs are there in the womb? And how many paternal organs? O Gautam! Three maternal organs are mentioned: flesh, blood, and head. Three paternal organs are: bones, marrow, and beard, mustache, hair, and nails. Sutra - 24

O Bhagavan! Will a fetus that dies in the womb be born in hell? O Gautam! A conscious fetus with five senses and all the necessary faculties, upon hearing the news of the approaching enemy army through the knowledge of the disintegration of semen, will think, "I will take my soul out of this place." Then, by creating a four-pronged army, it will fight the enemy army. If it dies at that time, desiring wealth, kingdom, enjoyment, and love, thirsty for wealth, etc., with the same mind, attachment, and determination, restless for wealth, etc., acting for it, motivated by it, then it will be born in hell. Therefore, O Gautam! It is said that a fetus can be born in hell. There is no other being. Sutra - 25

O Bhagavan! Is a fetus born in heaven? O Gautam! Some fetuses are born in heaven, and some are not. O Bhagavan! Why do you say that? O Gautam! A conscious fetus with five senses and all the necessary faculties, upon hearing a single word of righteousness and religion from a Shraman or Brahmin through the knowledge of the disintegration of semen and clairvoyance, will accept it and be born quickly with intense emotion. It will be attached to the intense love of righteousness. It will desire righteousness, virtue, heaven, and liberation, desiring righteousness, etc., thirsty for it, with the same mind, attachment, and determination, striving for righteousness, etc., eager for it, dedicated to it, acting for it, motivated by it, if it dies at that time, then it will be born in heaven. Therefore, some fetuses are born in heaven, and some are not. Sutra - 26

O Bhagavan! Does the fetus sleep on its back, on its side, or in a curved position? Does it stand or sit? Does it sleep or wake? Does it sleep when the mother sleeps and wake when the mother wakes? Does it feel happy when the mother is happy and sad when the mother is sad? O Gautam! The fetus sleeps on its back, and it feels sad when the mother is sad. Sutra - 27

The mother of a stable fetus protects it, nurtures it properly, and carries it. She keeps it straight and protects it in this way, both the fetus and herself. Sutra - 28. The fetus sleeps when the mother sleeps, wakes when the mother wakes, feels happy when the mother is happy, and sad when the mother is sad.

O Āyushmān! Then, in nine months, the mother gives birth to the fetus she carries in one of four forms. It is born as a woman, a man, a eunuch, or a mass of flesh. Sūtra - 33
If the semen is less and the menstrual fluid is more, then a woman is born. And if the menstrual fluid is less and the semen is more, then a man is born. Sūtra - 34
If both menstrual fluid and semen are in equal amounts, then a eunuch is born. And if only the menstrual fluid is stable, then a mass of flesh is born. Sūtra - 35
At the time of birth, the child comes out headfirst or feet first. If it comes out straight, then it is born safely. But if it comes out crooked, then it dies. Sūtra - 36
A sinful being, born impure and residing in an impure form in the womb, lives for 12 years at the most. Sūtra - 37

Then, crying and causing pain to its mother's body, it comes out of the vaginal opening. Sūtra - 39
In the womb, beings are born in an impure place like the Kuṁbhipāk Naraka, filled with excrement, feces, and urine. Sūtra - 40
Just as worms are born in excrement, so too is a being born in the midst of the man's bile, phlegm, semen, blood, and urine. Sūtra - 41
How can that being be purified, whose origin is in the collection of semen and blood? Sūtra - 42
Born from impurity, always filled with the stench of excrement, and constantly expecting purity, how can one be proud of such a body?

**Sūtra**
**Sūtra-43**
O Āyushmān! The ten stages of a being born in this way have been described in order. They are as follows:
**Sūtra-44**
Bālā, Krīḍā, Mandā, Balā, Prajñā, Hāyinī, Prapancā, Pragbhārā, Munmukhi and Śāyinī are the ten stages of life.
**Sūtra-45**
At birth, the being attains the first stage. Due to ignorance, it does not know pleasure, pain, or hunger.
**Sūtra-46**
In the second stage, it engages in various forms of play, and its mind is not sharp in its enjoyment of worldly pleasures.
**Sūtra-47**
In the third stage, it becomes capable of experiencing five types of worldly pleasures.
**Sūtra-48**
In the fourth stage, called Balā, the human being is capable of demonstrating its strength even when there is no need.
**Sūtra-49**
In the fifth stage, it becomes capable of acquiring wealth and family.
**Sūtra-50**
In the sixth stage, called Hāyinī, due to a decline in the senses, it becomes detached from worldly pleasures.

In the eighth stage, with a contracted abdomen and wrinkled skin, it becomes unattractive to women and enters old age.
**Sūtra-53**
In the ninth stage, called Munmukhi, the body becomes weak due to old age and is devoid of sexual desire.
**Sūtra-54**
In the tenth stage, its voice becomes weak, its tone changes. It becomes weak, with a confused mind, a deluded intellect, and experiences a state of sorrow and suffering.
**Sūtra-55**
Ten years of age is for physical development, twenty years for acquiring knowledge, thirty years for worldly pleasures, and forty years for acquiring specialized knowledge.
**Sūtra-56**
At fifty, eyesight weakens, at sixty, physical strength declines, and at seventy, self-awareness weakens.

Sūtrasūtra-57
The body bends by the age of ninety and life is complete by one hundred. How much happiness and how much sorrow is there in this? Sūtra-58
For those who live for 100 years with happiness and enjoy worldly pleasures, even for them, the practice of Jina-bhashit Dharma is auspicious. Sūtra-59
What is best for those who always live in sorrow and painful circumstances? For them, it is their duty to follow the superior Dharma preached by the Jina. Sūtra-60
While enjoying worldly pleasures, one should practice Dharma with the thought that they will attain superior happiness in the next life. One who is sorrowful should practice Dharma with the thought that they will not attain sorrow in the next life. Sūtra-61
Neither caste, wealth, knowledge, nor good education can liberate a man or woman from the cycle of birth and death. All these things are only enhanced by good karma. Sūtra-62
When good karma (punya) weakens, so does one's strength. When good karma increases, so does one's strength. Sūtra-63
O Āyushmān! By performing virtuous deeds, one's joy increases. There is an increase in praise, wealth, and fame. Therefore, O Āyushmān! One should never think that they have enough time, āvalikā, moments, breaths, stoka, lava, muhūrta, days, nights, fortnights, months, ayana, years, yugas, hundreds of years, thousands of years, lakhs, crores, or kroḍa-kroḍa years to live. Where we will remain steadfast by adopting many vows, virtues, restraints, rejections, medicinal fasts, etc. O Āyushmān! Why not think that this life is certainly full of obstacles? In it, various diseases like vāta, pitta, śleṣma, sannipāta, etc., harm life? Sūtra-64
O Āyushmān! In the past, the Yugalik, Arihant, Cakravartī, Baldev, Vasudev, Cāran, and Vidyādhara, etc., humans lived for lakhs of years without any disease. They were very gentle, beautiful in form, enjoyed excellent pleasures, had excellent qualities, and had beautiful bodies. Their hands and feet were like red lotus petals and soft. Their fingers were also soft. They had excellent and auspicious signs like mountains, cities, crocodiles, oceans, and wheels, etc. Their feet were well-established and stable like a tortoise's, their thighs were like the deer and kuruvinda named grass, their knees were like the joint of a round box and its lid, their thighs were like an elephant's trunk, their gait was like a mad elephant, full of vigour and luxury, their private parts were like a superior horse of a good breed, their waist was rounder than a lion's waist, the middle part of their body was like a three-legged stool, a mace, a mirror, and a sword made of pure gold, their navel was like the swirling and circumambulating Ganges, like a group of waves, like a lotus spread by the rays of the sun, deep and profound, their body hair was beautiful, their nature was beautiful, thin, black, smooth, well-proportioned, beautiful, and very…

The early humans had a body that was soft, delicate, with a belly like a fish or bird, broad and smooth like a lotus, and a slightly bent back, with little hair. Their bones were not visible through the flesh, and they were pure like gold, beautiful in form, free from disease and affliction, and possessed all 32 auspicious marks.

Their chest was bright like a golden stone, broad, flat, strong, vast, and marked with the Śrīvatsa symbol.

Their teeth were like a row of pearls, pure, white like a conch, the foam of cow's milk, a kunda flower, a water drop, or a lotus stalk. Their teeth were unbroken, well-proportioned, smooth, beautiful, and even. The soles of their feet and the bottom of their tongues were like pure gold heated in fire. Their voice was sweet like a sārasa bird, deep like the roar of a fresh cloud, and resonant like the sound of a kroñca bird and a kettledrum. Their noses were long, straight, and raised, like the beak of a garuḍa. Their faces were like a blooming lotus.

The voice of these humans was like the sound of letters, like clouds, like swans, like kroñca birds, like the sound of a bull, like the sound of a lion, like the sound of a direction-guarding deity, like the sound of a conch of the ocean-guarding deity.

They were of the Vrajṛṣabhanārāca-saṁghaṇa, with a square shape, and six thousand dhanuṣas in height.

O Āyusmān Śramaṇa! These humans were said to have 256 bones. These humans were naturally simple, humble in nature, free from vices, with little anger, pride, delusion, or greed, gentle, and compassionate. They were absorbed, simple, humble, with few desires, with little accumulation, and peaceful in nature. They were free from agriculture and trade, lived in the branches of trees like houses, desired only what was necessary, and ate the fruits and flowers of the Kalpavṛkṣa.

Sūtrakubja, Vāmana and Huṇḍaka. O Āyushmān! In the present time, only the Huṇḍaka institution exists. Sūtra-66

Due to the decline of the time, the human body's consolidation, institution, height, and lifespan gradually diminish. Sūtra-67

Anger, pride, deceit, greed, and the act of false weights and measures, all these vices increase. Sūtra-68

Scales and measures in the country are uneven. Royal families and years are uneven. Sūtra-69

In an uneven year, the potency of medicine decreases. In this time, due to the weakness of medicine, lifespan also decreases. Sūtra-70

In this way, like the waning moon in the dark fortnight, those humans who are devoted to Dharma live well. Sūtra-71

O Āyushmān! A man, regardless of his name, who bathes, worships the gods, performs auspicious rituals and atonement, bathes his head, wears a garland around his neck, adorns himself with gems and gold ornaments, wears new and expensive clothes, has a body smeared with sandalwood paste, is adorned with a pure garland and fragrant unguents, beautiful necklaces, half-necklaces, three-string necklaces, and a chest-piece, has a beautiful ring on his finger, is adorned with various gem-studded bracelets on his arms, is extremely beautiful, has a face illuminated by earrings, a head adorned with a crown, a chest adorned with a wide necklace, wears a long and beautiful upper garment, has a yellow-colored finger adorned with a ring, wears various gem-studded, pure, priceless, luminous, well-made, unique, beautiful, charming, and heroic-indicating bracelets, what more can be said?

Like a Kalpavriksha, adorned, decorated, and pure, he prostrates to his parents and says, "O son! Live for a hundred years." But if his lifespan is a hundred years, how much longer will the being live? He who lives for a hundred years lives for twenty yugas. That means he lives for 200 ayanas, or 600 seasons, or 1200 months, or 2400 fortnights, or 36,000 nights and days, or 1,080,000 muhūrtas, or 4,074,840,000 breaths. O Bhagavan! How does he consume twelve and a half 'tandulavāha'? O Gautama! A 'prastha' is twelve and a half 'pala' of rice that is pounded with a pestle, sifted through a sieve, free from chaff and husk, unbroken and complete, as prepared by a weak woman. That 'prastha' is also called 'māgadha'.

(Generally) they eat one 'prastha' of rice in the morning and one 'prastha' in the evening, twice a day. One 'prastha' contains 64,000 grains of rice. A man's daily intake is 32 'kavala' of 2,000 grains of rice, a woman's intake is 28 'kavala', and a eunuch's intake is 24 'kavala'. This is the calculation: two 'asati' make one 'prasṛti', two 'prasṛti' make one 'setikā', four 'setikā' make one 'kuḍava', four 'kuḍava' make one 'prasthaka', four 'prasthaka' make one 'āḍhaka', sixty 'āḍhaka' make one 'jighnya kumbha', eighty 'āḍhaka' make one 'madhyama kumbha', one hundred 'āḍhaka' make one 'utkṛṣṭa kumbha', and 500 'āḍhaka' make one 'vāha'. According to this 'vāha', they consume twelve and a half 'vāha' of rice. According to that calculation, Sūtra-72

It is said that there are 460 crore, 80 lakh grains of rice.

Āgama Sūtra 28, Payannāsūtra-5, 'Tandulavaicārika'
Sūtrasūtra - 73
This way, one who eats 22 and a half vahas of rice eats 5 and a half kumbhas of mung beans. Meaning, he eats 2400 āḍhakas of ghee and oil or 36,000 palas of salt. He changes clothes after two months, wearing 600 dhotis. If he changes clothes every month, he wears 1200 dhotis. This way, O Āyuṣman! This is the count or measurement of oil, ghee, salt, food, and clothes of a human being who lives for 100 years. This count of quantity has also been stated by the Mahṛṣi in two ways. Having counted those who have all this, what is there to count for those who have nothing? Sūtra - 74
First, the count of practical behavior was seen, now one should know the subtle and certain count. If it is not this way, then one should know the count as uneven. Sūtra - 75
The most subtle time, which cannot be divided, should be known as 'time'. There are countless times in one breath. Sūtra - 76
The one breath of a hṛṣṭapuṣṭa, free from debility and suffering, is called prāṇa. Sūtra - 77
Seven prāṇas make one stoka, seven stokas make one lava, 77 lavas make one muhūrta. Sūtra - 78
O Bhagavan! How many breaths are there in one muhūrta? O Gautama! Sūtra - 79
There are 3773 breaths. All the infinite knowers have stated this muhūrta-quantity. Sūtra - 80
Two palas make one muhūrta, 60 palas make one ahotraatra, 15 ahotraatras make one pakṣa, 2 pakṣas make 1 month. Sūtra - 81-82
A clock made of iron in the shape of a pomegranate flower should be made, with a hole in its bottom. The hole of the clock should be like the 96 hairs of a three-year-old calf's tail, which are straight and not bent. Sūtra - 83
Or, the hole of the clock should be like the hairs of a two-year-old elephant calf's tail, which are not broken. Sūtra - 84
There should be a hole of four angulas in a four-māśa gold bowl and a hard needle. Sūtra - 85
The quantity of water in that clock should be two āḍhakas, and that water should be used after filtering it through cloth. Sūtra - 86
The water should be like the clear water of a cloud or the water of a mountain river in the autumn season. Sūtra - 87
One year has 12 months, one year has 24 pakṣas and 360 nights and days.

## Agam Sutra 28, Payannasutra-5, 'Tandulavaicharik'
Sutra Sutra - 88
There are 1,13,900 breaths in one night and day. Sutra - 89
There are 33,55,700 breaths in one month. Sutra - 90
There are 40,74,84,000 breaths in one year. Sutra - 91
There are 40,74,54,00,000 breaths in a lifespan of 100 years. Sutra - 92
Now, observe the decay of lifespan due to the waning of night and day. (Listen) Sutra - 93
Thirty Muhurtas are lost in a night and day, and 900 Muhurtas are lost in a month. But the ignorant do not know this. Sutra - 94
In the Hemant season, the sun destroys 3600 Muhurtas of lifespan. Similarly, it happens in the summer and rainy seasons. One should know this. Sutra - 95
In this world, 50 years of lifespan are lost in sleep in a normal lifespan of 100 years. Similarly, 20 years are lost in childhood and old age. Sutra - 96, 97
The remaining 15 years are lost due to cold, heat, travel, hunger, thirst, fear, sorrow, and various kinds of diseases.
Thus, 85 years are lost. Those who live for 100 years live for only 15 years, and not everyone lives for 100 years. Sutra - 98
In this way, in a fleeting human life, those who do not follow the fourfold path of Dharma, will have to regret it later. Sutra - 99
Even after being born in this land of karma, a human being, under the influence of attachment, does not know the supreme path and the nature of the self, as taught by the Jinas. Sutra - 100
This life is as fleeting as the flow of a river, as fading as a blooming flower, and even happiness is impermanent. All three are quickly consumed. Sutra - 101
Just as a net traps a group of deer, similarly, the net of old age and death traps humans. Yet, blinded by the net of attachment, you cannot see all this. Sutra - 102
O Auspicious one! This body is dear, beloved, beautiful, pleasing, attractive, delightful, strong, trustworthy, approved, desired,

## Agam Sutra 28, Payannasutra-5, 'Tandulavaicharik'

This Sutra, praiseworthy and valuable like a jewel casket, is well-guarded like a cloth chest and an oil vessel. It is considered worthy of protection from the touch of cold, heat, hunger, thirst, thieves, bites, mosquitoes, wind, bile, phlegm, fever, and other diseases. But truly, this body is impermanent, imperishable, non-eternal, subject to growth and decay, and destined for destruction. Therefore, it must be abandoned sooner or later.

O Ayushman! In this body, there are 18 joints in the backbone. There are twelve rib bones in the shape of a casket. Six bones only surround the side part, which is called Kadah. The human abdomen is one Vitasthi (12-finger measurement) in size, and the neck is four fingers in size. The tongue is four Palas, and the eye is two Palas.

The head is made up of four sections of bone. It contains 32 teeth, a tongue seven fingers long, a heart of three and a half Palas, and a liver of 25 Palas. There are two intestines, which are called five Vamas. The two intestines are the large and the small. The large intestine expels feces, and the small intestine expels urine. Two sides are mentioned, one left and one right. The right side is associated with happiness, and the left side is associated with sorrow.

O Ayushman! There are 160 joints in this body, 107 vital points, 300 bones connected to each other, 900 nerves, 700 veins, 500 muscles, 9 arteries, 99 lakh hair follicles except for beard and mustache hair, and three and a half crore hair follicles including beard and mustache. O Ayushman! In this body, 160 veins originate from the navel and go towards the brain. They are called Rasaharani. Ascending, these veins activate the eyes, ears, nose, and tongue. And their damage destroys the functioning of the eyes, ears, nose, and tongue. O Ayushman! In this body, 160 veins originate from the navel and reach the soles of the feet. They provide the functioning of the shanks. The damage to these veins causes headache, hemiplegia, head pain, and blindness.

O Ayushman! In this body, 160 veins originate from the navel and reach the palms of the hands. They provide the functioning of the arms. And their damage causes pain in the armpit, back pain, abdominal pain, and O Ayushman! 160 veins originate from the navel and go downwards to meet the Gunda. And their damage causes
the wind to be in the right amount. And damage causes the blockage of feces, urine, and wind, making the human being disturbed and causing a disease called Pandu. O Ayushman! There are 25 veins that hold phlegm, 25 veins that hold bile, and 10 veins that hold semen. A man has 700 veins, a woman has 670 veins, and a eunuch has 680 veins.

O Ayushman! In this human body, the weight of blood is one Adhak, fat is half an Adhak, Mastuling is one Prastha, urine is one Adhak, feces is one Prastha, bile is one Kudava, phlegm is one Kudava, and semen is half a Kudava. In those who are afflicted with doshas, these quantities are less. A man has five chambers in his body, and a woman has six. A man has nine sources, and a woman has eleven. A man has 500 muscles, a woman has 470 muscles, and a eunuch has 480 muscles. Sutra - 103

If perhaps the flesh inside the body is transformed and expelled, then even the mother would feel disgust at seeing that impurity. Sutra - 104

The human body is impure due to flesh, semen, and bones. But it is adorned by clothing, fragrance, and garlands.

Sutrasutra - 115
This body is food for crows, dogs, worms, insects, fish, and scavengers like jackals, and is prone to disease. Who would be attached to such a body? Sutra - 116
Know that this body is filled with impure excrement, a house of flesh and bones, a source of waste, born from semen and menstrual blood, with nine orifices, and impermanent. Sutra - 117
You see a girl adorned with tilak, with beautiful lips. Sutra - 118
You see the external form, but you do not see the foul-smelling excrement within. Sutra - 119
Deluded by attachment, you dance and drink the impure juice of the forehead (through kissing). Sutra - 120
The juice that arises from the forehead, which you yourself spit out and despise, is the same juice you are attached to and drink with great passion.
The forehead is impure, the nose, various limbs, orifices, and cavities are also impure. The body is also covered with impure skin. Sutra - 121
A woman with eyes adorned with kohl, cleansed by bathing and scrubbing, adorned with soft flowers, and with a beautiful head of hair, causes attachment in the ignorant. Sutra - 122
The ignorant one who calls flowers an ornament for the head is only a flower. Not an ornament for the head. Listen! Sutra - 123
Fat, grease, juice, phlegm, mucus, and fat are all ornaments of the head. They are subject to the body. Sutra - 124
This body is not fit to be adorned. It is a house of excrement. It has two feet and nine orifices. It is filled with a strong stench. The ignorant human is extremely deluded in it. Sutra - 125
Stained by lust, you reveal your private parts and drink the foul-smelling excrement of your teeth and the pus that comes out of your skull. Sutra - 126
The tusks of an elephant, the teeth of a rabbit, and the flesh of a deer, the hide of a cow, the hair of a cheetah, and the nails are taken from their bodies. Sutra - 127
(What is the use of the human body?) You fool! That body is foul-smelling and subject to death. Why are you attached to it, trusting it constantly?

Phlegm, bile, urine, feces, fat, beard, etc., what is the attachment to these? Sutra - 130
There is a thigh bone, on it is the hip, above the hip is the back. There are 18 bones in the back. Sutra - 131
There are two eye bones and sixteen neck bones. There are twelve ribs in the back. Sutra - 132
This framework of hard bones bound by veins and nerves, is wrapped in flesh and skin. Sutra - 133
This body is a house of excrement, who will be attached to such a cesspool? Just as crows fly near a well of excrement. There is a sul-sul sound made by worms in it and a stench comes out of the source. (The same is the case with a dead body)
Sutra - 134
Birds peck at the eyes of a dead body with their beaks. The hands spread out like rags. They take out the intestines and the skull looks terrifying. Sutra - 135
Flies buzz around a dead body. There is a sul-sul sound from the rotten flesh. The group of worms that have arisen in it make a mis-mis sound. There is a thiv-thiv sound from the intestines. In this way, it looks quite repulsive. Sutra - 136
Know the state of the terrifying body with exposed ribs, devoid of consciousness, with dry limbs. Sutra - 137
Consider this body like a leaking, raw pot, which expels impurities through nine doors, with a feeling of detachment. Sutra - 138
Two hands, two feet and the head, are joined to the torso. They are the storehouse of dirty excrement. Why do you carry this excrement around? Sutra - 139
You are happy to see this body with its form walking on the royal path and you consider the fragrance of perfumes to be your own fragrance. Sutra - 140
You are happy to consider the smell of roses, champa, jasmine, agar, sandalwood and tarusk as your own fragrance.

## Āgama Sūtra 28, Payannāsūtra-5, 'Tandulavaicārik'

**Sūtra 'Mahilikā'**: She delights men with her gestures, hence 'Ramā'; she attracts men to her body, hence 'Anganā'; she involves men in various kinds of battles, conflicts, wars, forest excursions, taking loans without purpose, suffering from cold and heat, and causing distress, hence 'Lalana'; she controls men through yoga and niyoga, hence 'Yoṣit'; and she excites men's desires through various emotions, hence 'Vanitā'.

**Sūtra 144**: Some women behave like those who are intoxicated, some like those who are infatuated, and some like those who are suffering from respiratory ailments. Some are like enemies, and some prostrate themselves with tears. Some praise, some look with wonder, laughter, and glances. Some attract men with sweet words, some with playful gestures, some with embraces, some with words of reproach, some with displays of domesticity, some by writing or marking on the ground, some by dancing on a bamboo pole, some by embracing children, some by touching with fingers, massaging breasts, and pressing the hips. This woman is like a net in obstructing, like mud in trapping, like death in killing, like fire in burning, and like a sword in cutting to pieces.

**Sūtra 145**: This woman is sharp like a dagger, dark like ink, confusing like a dense forest, binding like a cupboard and a prison, and frightening like a deep, flowing river.

**Sūtra 146**: This woman is a vessel of hundreds of faults, a spreader of various kinds of disgrace, with a crooked heart, and deceitful thoughts.

**Sūtra 147, 148**: These women are engaged with one, play with another, exchange glances with another, and stay by the side of another. Even the wise cannot know her nature.

**Sūtra 149**: The grains of the Ganges, the water of the ocean, the size of the Himalayas, the fruit of intense penance, the child born from the womb, the hair on the back of a lion, the substance that remains in the stomach, the sound of a horse running - perhaps a wise human can know these, but not the heart of a woman.

**Sūtra 150**: Possessing such qualities, this woman is fickle-minded like a monkey and not worthy of trust in the world.

**Sūtra 151**: Just as a winnowing basket without grain, a garden without flowers, a cow without milk, and a pan without oil are useless, so too is a woman without happiness.

**Sūtra 152**: In the time it takes to close and open an eye, a woman's heart and mind become agitated a thousand times.

**Sūtra 153**: Advice is useless for the foolish, the old, those devoid of special knowledge, and those with a low nature like a pig in the indiscriminate world.

**Sūtra 154**: What is the use of a son, a father, and wealth accumulated through hard work, if they cannot provide any support at the time of death?

**Sūtra 155**: At the time of death, sons, friends, and wives leave, but well-earned Dharma does not leave.
