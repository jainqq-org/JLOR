## Āgama Sūtra 27, Payannāsūtra-4, ‘Bhaktaparijñā’

**Sūtra - 1**
I speak of the Bhaktaparijñā, in order to remember myself and others, after paying homage to the Muni Mahāvīrasvāmī, who is endowed with great wonders and great influence.

**Sūtra - 2**
The Jain religion, victorious and existing, is the giver of the garden of the Kalpavṛkṣa, by whose support the suffering beings, wandering in the forest of the world, attain the bliss of liberation.

**Sūtra - 3**
Having obtained the rare human birth and the word of the Jineśvara Bhagavān, the virtuous person should become subservient to the knowledge and the taste of eternal bliss.

**Sūtra - 4**
The wise person desires the bliss of liberation, free from afflictions, for that which is to be experienced today will be remembered tomorrow.

**Sūtra - 5**
The wise person calls the happiness of humans and gods as misery from the point of view of the ultimate goal, because it is terrible and impermanent in its consequences. Therefore, what is the benefit of that happiness? (i.e., that happiness is of no use).

**Sūtra - 6**
The human with a pure intellect should strive to follow the commands of the Jineśvara, which are the means of eternal bliss, as stated in the Jina’s word.

**Sūtra - 7**
The worship of knowledge, vision, conduct, and austerity, as spoken by the Jineśvara, is called the worship of his commands.

**Sūtra - 8**
Even the soul who is diligent in following the vows, at the time of death, attains complete devotion by worshipping according to the sūtra.

**Sūtra - 9**
The death of the diligent person is described as three types: Bhaktaparijñā death, Igni death, and Pādapōpagam death, for the courageous (the liberated) do not have the same dharma as death.

**Sūtra - 10**
Bhaktaparijñā death is of two types: with thought and without thought. The death of the diligent ascetic with a weak body, through Sanlekhanā, is with thought.

**Sūtra - 11**
The death of the ascetic without thought, without Sanlekhanā, is Bhaktaparijñā death without effort.

Page #6:
---------------------------
## Agam Sutra 27, Payannasutra-4, 'Bhaktaparijna'

I will explain the knowledge of Bhaktaparijna death as per my understanding.

**Sutra 12**
A Yati of the present time, who is devoid of patience and strength, who commits untimely death and who commits Akrit (transgression), is worthy of death without any obstacles.

**Sutra 13**
One who desires the happiness of Upasham, who is devoid of sorrow and laughter, who is hopeless for his own life, who is devoid of the desire for worldly pleasures and who is striving for Dharma, such a person is worthy of Bhaktaparijna death.

**Sutra 14**
One who has determined the state of death, who has recognized the world as diseased and devoid of qualities, such a Bhavy Yati or householder should be considered worthy of Bhaktaparijna death.

**Sutra 15**
The ocean of the world, which is like a crocodile with disease, old age, and death, which is always like a pool of water with birth, which gives terrible pain in the end, is very difficult to cross. This is a matter of sorrow.

**Sutra 16**
Those who are afflicted with remorse, who are dear to Dharma, who have a desire to condemn faults, and who are free from faults and bad character, such Pasththadics are also worthy of fasting.

**Sutra 17**
After fasting, he comes to the feet of the Guru with joy and humility, and placing his hands on his forehead like a crown, he worships the Guru and says this.

**Sutra 18**
O virtuous one! I wish to board the excellent ship of Bhaktaparijna and sail through the ocean of the world with the help of the liberating Guru.

**Sutra 19**
That Guru, beautiful with the nectar of compassion, also says to him: (O son!) Accept the criticism, accept the vows, forgive everyone, and then accept the Bhaktaparijna fast.

**Sutra 20, 21**
Saying "I wish!", with devotion and respect, with a pure resolve, having destroyed the evil, worshipping the Guru's feet properly, desiring to liberate his own self, with intense faith due to the desire for liberation (Sanveg) and the desire to leave the world (Udveg), whatever he does for purification, he becomes a worshipper of the soul.

**Sutra 22**
Now he criticizes properly, free from the fault of Aloayan, behaving like a child in his childhood.

**Sutra 23**
When the Acharya gives the atonement with all his qualities, he starts the atonement penance properly.

## Sutra
**Aagam Sutra 27, Payannasutra-4, 'Bhaktaparijna'**

The pure-hearted disciple says again. Sutra-24

To save us from the terrifying ocean of the world, which is like a group of aquatic beings suffering terrible pain, may the great Guru Maharaj, who is like a smooth-sailing ship, establish us in the great vows (i.e., bestow the vows upon us). Sutra-25

The Yati who has renounced anger is the one who has taken the unbroken great vow, even then, he is eligible for the initiation of the Pravrajya vow. Sutra-26

Just as a servant returns after diligently completing the order of his master, so too, he who observes the conduct throughout his life, returns to the Guru in the same way. Sutra-27

Even he who has observed the vow with transgression and broken the vow with the punishment of Akuti (deceit), is considered eligible for initiation by the one who is present with right understanding. Sutra-28

After that, the Guru initiates the disciple, whose head is bowed down by the weight of the great vow, which is like a mountain, with the proper procedure. Sutra-29

Now, for the Deshaviriti Shravak who is devoted to blood and Jinavachan, the pure Anuvrat is bestowed upon him at the time of death. Sutra-30

He who is free from attachment and has a generous heart, whose hair stands on end with joy at the mention of the Jinas, worships the Guru, the Sangha, and the fellow-religionists with sincere devotion. Sutra-31

The Shravak should use his wealth for the sake of the primary Jinenndra Prasad, the Jinabimb, and the highest prestige, as well as for writing excellent scriptures, for the Sutirth, and for the worship of the Tirthankaras. Sutra-32

If that Shravak is fond of all renunciation and restraint, with a mind, speech, and body that are opposed to (worldly desires), without attachment to his family, with sorrow for the suffering of others, and with dispassion... Sutra-33

...that Shravak should accept the initiation like Santhara, and by following the rules, should accept the five great vows, which are the form of all renunciation, and the primary Samayik conduct. Sutra-34, 35

When that Shravak, who is determined to observe the Samayik conduct and to accept the great vow, and who has performed the final Pacchakkhan, says to the great Guru, with specific qualities, bowing his head at his lotus feet: "O Bhagavan!"

## Agam Sutra 27, Payannasutra-4, 'Bhaktaparijna'

Sutra, with your permission, I accept the Bhaktaparijna Anashan. Sutra-36

Knowing the divine purpose of achieving well-being for both the one taking the Anashan and oneself through worship, the Acharya should administer the Anashan; otherwise (if Anashan is taken without considering the purpose), it is considered a fault. Sutra-37

After that, the Guru should show the excellent substances to the disciple and explain the three types of food, up to the Javvajiv, through Pacchakkhan. Sutra-38

Seeing (the excellent substances), a being who has reached the shore of the Bhavasagar should contemplate what use it is to him; a being who desires substances should contemplate accordingly, even after experiencing the emotions of enjoyment. Have I not enjoyed and renounced? Sutra-39

Being aware that even pure substances are ultimately impure, one should engage in auspicious contemplation; one who experiences sorrow should be given such Choyana (inspiration). Sutra-40

For the purification of the Udarmala, if Samadhipan (water with sugar, etc.) is good for him, then he should be given that sweet water to drink, and he should be given a little laxative. Sutra-41, 42

Cardamom, cinnamon, Nagakesar, and Tamalpatra, boiled with sugar and milk, cooled and given to drink, is called Samadhipan. (Drinking it relieves heat.)

After that, he should be given a laxative with a sweet medicine made from iron-like substances. Because by extinguishing the fire in the stomach, this (the one performing the Anashan) attains Samadhi with ease. Sutra-43

The ascetic performing Anashan, here he desires the three types of food (Ashan, Khadim, and Svadim) up to Javvajiv, in this way, the Acharya who is administering the Niryamaana should request the Sangh. Sutra-44

For him (the ascetic), the Sangh should perform Kayotsarga for two hundred and fifty-six breaths, explaining all matters related to worship in a non-obstructive manner. Sutra-45

After that, in the assembly of the Acharya Sangh, the ascetic should be explained the four types of food through Pacchakkhan, according to the Chaityavandan ritual. Sutra-46

Or, for Samadhi, the three types of food should be explained, including the Agara, through Pacchakkhan. After that, water should also be renounced, observing the opportunity.

## Sutra
Aagam Sutra 27, Payannasutra-4, 'Bhaktaparijna' Sutra-47

After that, bowing his head and placing his two hands on his head like a crown, he (the one who is fasting) makes the feeling of remorse known to the entire assembly. Sutra-48

I apologize for all the kashayas I have committed with the Acharya, Upadhyaya, Shishya, Kula, and Gana, with my body, speech, and mind. Sutra-49

O Bhagavan! I apologize for all my transgressions, please forgive me. I also apologize to the assembly of the virtuous, with a pure heart. Sutra-50

In this way, through veneration, apology, and self-criticism, the karma accumulated in this life is destroyed in an instant, like the queen of the deer. Sutra-51

Now, with a firm resolve for the Mahavrata, with a mind filled with the words of the Jinas, one who is mindful of food and who is pleasing to the mind through intense remorse, to him (the one who is fasting); Sutra-52

The Acharya Maharaj gives a lesson like wood to him who considers himself fulfilled by the benefits of the fast, to overcome the sin-like Kadava. Sutra-53

The root of the Kudaagrah (greed) has grown large, like a tree. Uproot this falsehood from its roots, O dear one! And nourish the right conduct, like the supreme truth, with the principles of the Sutras. Sutra-54

And then, through love for virtue, practice intense devotion to the Vitaraga Bhagavan. And develop a love for the five salutations, like the essence of the teachings. Sutra-55

Always strive for self-study, which benefits the well-being of the virtuous. And protect the five great vows daily, with your own conscience as your witness. Sutra-56

Abandon the Niyan Shalya, like a thorn, which is a hindrance to great and virtuous deeds due to delusion. And subdue the Magendras, like the senses, which are condemned by the group of Munis. Sutra-57

Destroy the Kashaya-like Pisach, which is like an obstacle to the bliss of Nirvana, a terrible destroyer leading to hell, and a constant aid in the desire for worldly pleasures. Sutra-58

When time has not arrived and a little bit of conduct remains, wield the sword to destroy the great enemy, like delusion.

## Agam Sutra 27, Payannasutra-4, 'Bhaktaparijna'

**Sutra 59:**
Like a thread and wood are beneficial for teaching, so listen to the teachings.

**Sutra 60:**
Abandoning all forms of falsehood, which is like the root-seed of the world, become skilled in the meditation of Namaskara with a firm mind for Samyaktv.

**Sutra 61:**
Just as people, due to their thirst, consider mirage as water, similarly, a deluded mind, due to falsehood, desires happiness from evil deeds.

**Sutra 62:**
The great sins that intense falsehood gives to a living being, even fire, poison, or a black snake cannot inflict.

**Sutra 63:**
A deluded mind, due to falsehood, experiences intense suffering in this very life, like the Datta Raja of Turuman city, due to the sin of hating the virtuous.

**Sutra 64:**
Do not be negligent for Samyaktv, which destroys all suffering, because knowledge, penance, vigor, and conduct reside in Samyaktv.

**Sutra 65:**
Just as you are attached to material things, attached to love, and have blood for the attachment of virtue, similarly, become attached to Jinshasan through the attachment of Dharma.

**Sutra 66:**
One who is corrupted by Samyaktv should be known as corrupted by everything, but one who is corrupted by conduct is not the most corrupted, because a living being who has attained Samyaktv does not wander much in the world.

**Sutra 67, 68:**
One who is corrupted by Darshan should be considered corrupted, because one who has fallen from Samyaktv does not attain liberation. A living being without conduct attains liberation, but a living being without Samyaktv does not attain liberation.

**Sutra 69:**
Even a living being with pure Samyaktv and without restraint earns the Tirthankara karma. Just as those who are destined for welfare in the future, like the Lord Krishna of the Harivansh and King Shrenik, etc., have earned the Tirthankara karma, similarly, living beings with pure Samyaktv attain the tradition of welfare. (Because) a gem like Samyakdarshan is invaluable for the Sura and Asura realms.

**Sutra 70:**
A living being dies due to time after attaining dominion over the three realms. But after attaining Samyaktv, a living being attains liberation with eternal happiness.

---------------------------
**Agam Sutra 27, Payannasutra-4, 'Bhaktaparijna'**

**Sutra 71**
Perform intense devotion with pure emotion due to these three reasons.

**Sutra 72**
Even solitary devotion to the Jinas is capable of preventing downfall and leads to a continuous stream of rare happiness until attaining liberation.

**Sutra 73**
If knowledge grants liberation and fruit to the devotee, then will the knowledge of liberation grant liberation to the non-devotee?

**Sutra 74**
The person who does not devote themselves to the Lord, the Victorious One, who is the leader of all worship, is like someone who sows sugarcane in barren land with great effort.

**Sutra 75**
The person who desires worship without actually performing it is like someone who desires grain without seed or rain without clouds.

**Sutra 76**
Just like the life of the gem merchant in Rajgriha who became a frog, devotion to Shri Jinendra Maharaj leads to birth in a good time and the attainment of happiness.

**Sutra 77**
Do not abandon the Navkar mantra, which destroys the world with pure intention, without focusing your mind on anything else, even for a moment.

**Sutra 78**
Jinendra Bhagwan has said that even a single salutation to the Arhant at the time of death is capable of destroying the world.

**Sutra 79**
The wicked Mahavat, who was called a thief and impaled on a stake, became a Yaksha with eyes like lotus petals, dwelling in auspicious meditation, by chanting "Namo Jinanam."

**Sutra 80**
Countless times, living beings have taken and abandoned meaningless material forms, along with devotional salutations.

**Sutra 81**
Salutation is like a flag to be taken for worship, and then it is like an unimpeded chariot for the living being to travel on the path of liberation.

**Sutra 82**
Just as knowledge, properly cultivated through worship, controls the demon, so too does knowledge, properly cultivated, controls the demon-like mind.

## Sutra
A
Agam Sutra 27, Payannasutra-4, 'Bhaktaparijna' Sutra-83
Just as the Krishna Sarpa (black snake) is subdued by a mantra chanted in the proper way, similarly, the mind, like a Krishna Sarpa, is subdued by knowledge chanted in the proper way. Sutra-84
Just as a monkey cannot stay still for even a moment, similarly, the mind cannot stay still (unchanging) for even a moment without the pleasure of worldly objects. Sutra-85
For that, one should bind the monkey-like mind, which is always restless, with the rope of Jineshwara's teachings and make it dwell in auspicious meditation. Sutra-86
Just as a needle attached to a thread does not get lost even if it falls into garbage, similarly, a being (Jiva) attached to the thread (of auspicious meditation) does not get lost even if it falls into the world. Sutra-87
If Yav Rajarshi saved a person from death through worldly verses and (the king) attained virtue, then what to say about a being who gets rid of the suffering of death through the Sutras taught by Jineshwara Bhagwan? Sutra - 88
By merely listening to (remembering) these words of Upashama, Vivek, and Sanvar, Chilatiputra, who had only Shrutagyan (knowledge gained through listening), attained knowledge and divinity. Sutra-89,90
Knowing the difference between beings, by the effort of Jiva, you should abandon the killing of the six types of beings through the right conduct of mind, speech, and body.
Just as you do not like suffering, similarly, all beings do not like suffering. Knowing this, with utmost respect, be careful, consider every being as your own self, and practice compassion. Sutra-91
Just as there is nothing higher than Mount Meru for the world and nothing bigger than the sky, similarly, there is no dharma (righteousness) equal to ahimsa (non-violence). You should believe this. Sutra - 92
This Jiva has a relationship with all beings in every way. Therefore, by killing a being, you are killing all those who are related to you. Sutra - 93
One should consider the killing of a being as one's own killing and compassion for a being as one's own compassion. Therefore, a being who desires the happiness of the soul has abandoned the killing of all beings. Sutra - 94
One should understand with subtle intelligence that all the suffering that a being experiences while wandering in the four states of existence is the result of killing.

## Sutra
Aagam Sutra 27, Payannasutra-4, 'Bhaktaparijna' Sutra-95

One should understand that great happiness, dominion, whatever is naturally beautiful, health, good fortune, all of these are the fruits of non-violence. Sutra-96

A Chandala, even though he was thrown away for the sake of a Susumar Drah, attained the proximity of the Gods due to the virtue of the vow of non-violence arising from saving a single living being in a day. Sutra-97, 98

One should abandon all four types of false speech by effort, for which even restrained men are entangled by the fault of language (through karma by false speech). Those four types of falsehood are: revealing an untrue thing, like saying the soul is omnipresent; speaking a different meaning, like using the word "cow" to refer to a dog; saying truth is falsehood, like saying the soul does not exist; and slander, like calling someone a thief when they are not. And then, one should not speak falsely through laughter, anger, greed, or fear. But one should speak truthful words that are beautiful and beneficial to the living being. Sutra-99

A truthful man is worthy of trust like a mother, worthy of worship by people like a guru, and beloved by all like a relative. Sutra-100

Whether one has matted hair or a topknot, is shaven-headed, wears bark cloth, or is naked, a liar is called a hypocrite and a Chandala. Sutra-101

Even a single lie destroys many truthful words, because a single false word sent Vasu Raja to hell. Sutra-102

O patient one! Do not even think of taking, even a small amount of another's wealth, like a probe for a toothache, without giving it back. Sutra-103

And then, the man who takes another's wealth also takes his life. Because that man sacrifices the life of a being for money, but does not give up the money. Sutra-104

Therefore, accepting the supreme Dharma of compassion for living beings, do not take what is not given, because the Jineswar Bhagwan and the Ganadharas have forbidden it, and it is against the people and also unrighteous. Sutra-105, 106

A thief suffers greatly in hell and in the animal realm even in the afterlife; in human life, he is also afflicted by poverty and destitution. The son of a Shravak who renounced stealing, obtained happiness in the same way that an old woman named Kidhi, whose house was robbed by thieves, made the big toe of one of the thieves from the back of a peacock. The king recognized this mark and spared the Shravak's son, but killed all the other thieves.

Agama Sutra 27, Paryannasūtra 4, 'Bhaktaparijñā'

Sutra 107
Through the protection of the new brahmacarya, protect the pure brahmacarya and always conquer lust, considering it to be full of great faults.

Sutra 108
Indeed, all the faults that cause suffering in this world and the next world are brought about by the human's concept of sexual intercourse.

Sutra 109, 110
Rati and arati, the two fickle-tongued ones, the fierce-hooded ones in the form of volition, the ones dwelling in the cave of sense objects, the ones with the face of intoxication, and the ones with the form of arrogant anger - these appear to be under the control of the human, who is bitten by the snake of kāma, the one with the garment of modesty, the one with the beard of ego, and the one causing unbearable suffering.

Sutra 111
The living being endures the pain of the terrifying hell and the dreadful ocean of the worldly existence, but does not see the insignificance of the desired happiness.

Sutra 112
Just as the grocer, pierced by hundreds of arrows of lust and distressed, was thrown by the king's wife into the latrine, and he remained there, enduring the foul smell.

Sutra 113
The person attached to lust does not know the accessible and inaccessible, like the ascetic Vaiśyāyana. Just as the wealthy merchant Kubera remained aloof from the sexual pleasure of his own mother who gave birth to him immediately.

Sutra 114
Considering the nature of this prohibition, leave aside the one who has incited the quarrel of lust, who is pervaded by Kāmadeva and is like the creeper of the poison of faults, for women.

Sutra 115
The woman blinded by the objects of senses, without respecting her family, lineage, husband, son, mother, and father, falls into the ocean of suffering equal to that.

Sutra 116
Comparing women to rivers, women are downward-flowing, having beautiful breasts (like the rivers holding beautiful water), attractive to see, beautiful, and slow-moving, and they also pierce the mountain-like (men) like the rivers.

Sutra 117
Who will really trust the form of the serpent-like woman who is extremely recognizable, extremely dear, and then extremely loving?

Sutra 118
The woman with destroyed hopes, extremely trustworthy, ready for favors, and deeply loving, but once displeasing, soon leads the husband towards death.

## Sutra
**Agam Sutra 27, Payannasutra-4, 'Bhaktaparijna' Sutra - 119**

A woman, like a new garland of jasmine, beautiful to look at, with delicate limbs and bound by virtue (thread), steals the heart of a man. Sutra - 120

But the beauty of her appearance, like the embrace of a woman, is intoxicating, like the garland of Kaner worn by a condemned man, it destroys the man. Sutra - 121

The sight of women is indeed beautiful, so what is the benefit of the pleasure of union? The fragrance of a garland is also fragrant, but its touch is like destruction. Sutra - 122

The king of Saketa, named Devarati, became corrupt by the pleasures of kingship because his queen, due to the rage of jealousy, threw him into the river and he drowned. Sutra - 123

A woman is a river of sorrow, a cave of sin, a house of deceit, a tormentor, like the wood of the fire-stick that kindles the fire, a mine of sorrow and the opposite of happiness. Sutra - 124

Who is the man who, not knowing the control of the mind, will be able to escape properly from the gaze of a woman with eyes like a deer, whose arrow of desire is widespread? Sutra - 125

Just as the poison of a snake increases with its high and dense cloud-like garland, so too does a woman with high breasts increase the poison of attachment in a man. Sutra - 126

Therefore, you should abandon the sight of such women, whose sight is like that of a poisonous serpent; for the arrows of women's eyes destroy life like virtue. Sutra - 127

Even the mind of a muni with little virtue melts like wax in fire from the company of a woman. Sutra - 128

Even if one renounces all company and becomes lean-bodied through austerity, like a muni dwelling in a cave (lion-cave), even a muni is moved by the company of a woman. Sutra - 129, 130

In the river of womanhood, which is like a wave of beauty, a flood of pleasure, and water of youth, what man in the world does not drown?

The wise man has crossed the ocean of youth, which is like water of desire, a crocodile of attachment, full of aquatic creatures of pleasure and pride, and a crocodile of lust.

## Sutra
Aagam Sutra 27, Payannasutra-4, 'Bhaktaparijna' Sutra-131

Renounce all internal and external attachments through the three causes of giving, causing to give, and receiving, and through the combination of mind, speech, and body. Sutra-132

With the intention of attachment (parigraha), a being kills, lies, steals, engages in sexual intercourse, and commits acts of unconsciousness without measure. (Attachment does not have a measure). Sutra-133

Attachment is the cause of great fear, because even though the son stole the wealth, the Shravak Kunchik Seth was afflicted with doubt about the Muni. Sutra-134

The man who is free from all (external and internal) attachments, has a cool result, and a calm mind, experiences a happiness that even a Chakravarti cannot attain. Sutra-135

The great vows of a Muni free from blemishes, unbroken and without transgression, are destroyed by the blemishes of Niyan. Sutra-136

That (Niyan blemish) is of three types: filled with attachment, filled with aversion, and filled with delusion. Consider the prayer for inferior lineage, etc., for the sake of Dharma as a delusion-filled Niyan. Consider the Niyan done for the sake of attachment as attachment-filled, and the Niyan done for the sake of aversion as aversion-filled. Sutra-137

The example of Gangadatta is famous for attachment-filled Niyan, the example of Vishvabhuthi, etc., is famous for aversion-filled Niyan (in the life of Mahavira Swami), and the example of Chandapingal, etc., is famous for delusion-filled Niyan. Sutra-138

The man who, neglecting the happiness of liberation, performs Niyan for the sake of temporary happiness, is like someone who destroys a vaidurya gem for a glass gem. Sutra-139

It is appropriate to pray for the benefit of suffering-destruction, karma-destruction, samadhi-death, and the seed of enlightenment. It is not appropriate to ask for anything else. Sutra-140

By abandoning the Niyan blemish, by abstaining from nighttime meals, by protecting the five great vows through the five committees and three guptis, one practices the happiness of liberation. Sutra-141

A being attached to the objects of the senses falls into the ocean of samsara like a bird with clipped wings, without any good qualities and without any chance of escape.

**Sutrasutra-142,143**
Just as a dog, even after chewing on dry bones, does not get its juice and absorbs the juice from its soles, yet feels pleasure while licking it, so too, a man who enjoys the company of women does not get pleasure, yet considers the exertion of his body as pleasure. Sutra-144
Just as there is no essence in the womb of a kel, even after searching thoroughly, similarly, there is no pleasure to be found in the objects of the senses, even after searching extensively. Sutra-145
The wife of a merchant who went abroad by the auditory sense, the merchant of Mathura by the passion of the eye, the prince by the smell, and the king of Sodas by the taste of the tongue were destroyed. Sutra-146
The king of the wicked Somalika was destroyed by the sense of touch; if he was destroyed by a single object, what will happen to him who is attached to the five senses? Sutra-147
A being who desires objects falls into the insurmountable ocean of existence, and he who is free from objects crosses the ocean of existence. The example of the two brothers (Jinpalit and Jinrakshit) who met the goddess of Ratnadweep is famous. Sutra-148
Beings who desire passion are cheated, and beings who are free from desire are free from any obstacles (desired), a being who has attained the essence of the discourse should be free from desire. Sutra-149
Beings who are attached to objects fall into the terrible ocean of the world, and beings who are not attached to objects cross the forest of the world. Sutra-150
Therefore, O valiant man! By the strength of patience, subdue the indomitable (suppressing suffering) lion-like senses; by doing so, you will conquer the internal enemy-like and hateful, and accept the flag of worship. Sutra-151
Knowing the consequences of anger, etc., and knowing the virtues that result from their suppression, O good man! By effort, suppress the afflictions like kshaya. Sutra-152
Know the cause of the increase and decrease of kshaya, which are the most intense sufferings of the three worlds and the supreme happiness, all in order. Sutra-153
Nanda, etc., by anger, Parashurama, etc., by pride, Pandurajja (Pandava Arya) by illusion, and Lohananda, etc., by greed have suffered.

Sutra-Sutra-154
Such teachings, like the nectar of immortality, soak the mind, and just as a thirsty man is calmed by drinking water, so too does the disciple, becoming extremely healthy, say:

Sutra-163

Sutra-164, 165
Therefore, O patient man! You too, relying on sattva, cultivate patience and contemplate the nirguna nature of the vast ocean of the world.
Birth, old age, and death, like water, are endless, like suffering, filled with aquatic creatures, and the cause of suffering for the soul. Such a sea of existence is very painful and fierce.
Sutra-166
I am blessed because I have found this rare boat of the true Dharma, which is difficult to obtain in millions of births, for the vast ocean of existence.
