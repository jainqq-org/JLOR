In the Jain tradition, Maryadapurushotam Ram is considered one of the 63 Shalaka
Purushas. One of his names was also Padma. This name is more prevalent in Jain
Puranas and Charitakavyas. Jain poets have presented Ram's character in various
languages like Prakrit, Sanskrit, Apabhramsha, etc., under names like
Paumachariyam, Paumachariyu, Padma Purana, Padmacharit, etc. Acharya Ravishena's
(7th century) present work, Padma Purana, is considered one of the most
excellent character-based epic poems in Sanskrit. Even though it is a Purana,
this poem is so amazing in terms of poetic art, psychoanalysis, character
portrayal, etc., that it cannot be compared to any other Purana poem. The poetic
elegance in it is so much that this poetic stream, emanating from the mental
snow-capped mountains as the poet's inner voice, has become like the Mandakini
itself. From the point of view of the subject matter, the poet has depicted the
Vidhyadharaloka, Anjana-Pavananjay, Hanuman, Sukoshal, etc., along with the main
plot, which has increased the interest of the book so much that one does not
want to leave it in the middle once they start reading it. This book, edited and
translated into Hindi by Dr. (Pandit) Pannalal Jain Sahityacharya with a
preface, appendix, etc., has been published in three parts by Bharatiya
Gyanpeeth. This is another new edition of the book, keeping in mind the
expectation and need of scholars, researchers, and self-study lovers.

## Table of Contents  **Sixty-sixth Chapter:** When the news reaches Ravana that
Lakshmana's strength has diminished due to the effects of Vishalya, he becomes
envious and starts laughing mockingly. Ministers like Mrganga try to convince
Ravana that it is best to return Sita and make peace with Rama. Ravana agrees to
their suggestion in front of the ministers, but secretly instructs the messenger
to convey a different message. The messenger reaches Rama's court and praises
Ravana, suggesting that Rama should let go of Ravana's brothers and sons. Rama
replies that he doesn't need the kingdom and will wander in the forest with
Sita, while Ravana can enjoy the earth. The messenger again supports Ravana's
side. Seeing this, Bhamandal gets angry and prepares to kill the messenger, but
Lakshmana calms him down. The messenger returns and informs Ravana of
everything.  **Sixty-seventh Chapter:** Hearing the messenger's report, Ravana
is initially confused, but then decides to master the Bahurupini Vidya and
becomes excited. He immediately orders his servants to prepare the Shanti-
Jinalaya and instructs the city's Jinalayas to perform puja for the Jindev. The
chapter describes the Jinalayas located in various places.  **Sixty-eighth
Chapter:** The Nandishwar Parva falls between the Ashtami and Purnima of Falgun
Shukla. The chapter describes its significance. Both armies decide not to fight
during the festival. Ravana also performs puja to the Jinendra Bhagwan with
devotion in the Shanti-Jinalaya.  **Seventy-first Chapter:** Ravana sits on the
throne in the Shanti-Jinalaya to master the Vidya in front of the Jinendradev.
As per Ravana's order, Mandodari instructs the Yamadanda Mantri that everyone
should remain peaceful while Ravana is engaged in mastering the Vidya and should
follow various rules for his well-being.  **Seventieth Chapter:** When the news
of Ravana mastering the Bahurupini Vidya reaches Rama's army, everyone becomes
worried. This Vidya takes twenty-four days to master. If Ravana masters it, he
will become invincible. Considering this, the army decides to disrupt Ravana's
Vidya practice.

## Padma Purana  When people sought advice from Ramachandraji on this matter, he
clearly stated that how could it be right to commit such a misdeed against
someone who has taken vows and is seated in a Jain temple.  "Rama is a great
soul, he will not indulge in unrighteousness,"  convinced of this, the
Vidhyadhar king himself did not go, but he sent his sons to Lanka to cause
trouble. The sons created havoc in Lanka, causing the Lankans to be terrified
and seek refuge in Ravana, who was seated in the Jain temple. However, Ravana
was engrossed in meditation. The people were terrified, so the presiding deities
of the Jain temple, through their power of reaction, stopped the sons. On the
other hand, in Ramachandraji's camp, the presiding deities of the Jain temples
fought with the presiding deities of Ravana's peaceful Jain temples, trying to
stop them. Subsequently, two Yaksha kings named Purnabhadra and Manibhadra, came
to Ravana's aid, stopped the sons, drove them away, and rebuked Ramachandraji
for their misdeeds. Sugriva explained the truth and calmed them down by
performing an Aryaavataran.  Later, at Lakshmana's request, both Yakshas agreed
that they would not cause any harm to the city dwellers, but would try to
distract Ravana from his meditation.  **16-23**  **Seventy-first Chapter**
Seeing the Yaksha kings calmed, Angad became eager to see Lanka. Skanda, Neel,
and other sons joined him. All these sons entered Lanka. Seeing Angad's beauty,
the women of Lanka were stirred. The sons entered Ravana's palace. The
magnificent splendor of the palace amazed them. They all worshipped the Jina in
the peaceful Jain temple. Ravana was demonstrating his knowledge while seated in
the half-lotus posture in front of Shantinath Bhagwan. Even when Angad caused
various disturbances, Ravana did not deviate from his meditation, and at that
very moment, he mastered the art of transformation. Seeing Ravana master the
art, Angad and others flew back to Ramachandraji's army through the sky.
**24-30**  **Seventy-second Chapter** Ravana's eighteen thousand wives, having
been harassed by Angad, went to Ravana and expressed their grief. Ravana
comforted them. The next day, Ravana entered the pleasure garden with great joy.
The Vidhyadharis, seated near Sita, tried to attract her towards Ravana. Seeing
Ravana's strength, Sita lamented her misfortune. Ravana wanted to attract Sita
towards him with fear and affection, but Sita said to Ravana, "O Dashaanan!
Before you shoot arrows in the battle, tell Rama this message from me: without
you, the sister of the universe has died a slow death..." and fainted. Seeing
the strong bond of love between Sita and Rama, Ravana regretted his actions, but
due to the excitement of the battle, his regret vanished, and he firmly decided
to fight.  **31-38**  **Seventy-third Chapter** The sun rose. Ravana's council
of ministers was perplexed by his stubbornness. The queen Mandodari also...

## Padma Purana  **Seventy-seventh Chapter:**  Vibhishan faints in grief after
Ravana's death, desires self-immolation and laments sorrowfully. Ravana's
eighteen thousand wives arrive at the battlefield, embrace his corpse and wail.
The entire sky and earth are filled with sorrow. Rama, Lakshmana, Bhamandal,
Hanuman and others console them. The brief story of Pritikar is narrated in
passing.  **Seventy-eighth Chapter:** Rama says, "The enmity of the wise lasts
till death, so why hold any grudge against Ravana now? Let's perform his funeral
rites." Everyone agrees with Rama and they all gather near Ravana's body.
Mandodari and other queens lament sorrowfully. Consoling them, they perform
Ravana's funeral rites with sandalwood and other fragrant substances and then
proceed to the Padma Sarovar. There, under the protection of Bhamandal and
others, Bhanukarna, Indrajit and Meghvahan are brought. All of them become monks
from the heart. They praise Rama and Lakshmana. Rama and Lakshmana encourage
them to enjoy worldly pleasures as before, but they remain indifferent to
worldly desires. Sorrow and despair spread throughout Lanka. Tears flow
everywhere. At the end of the day, a Muni named Anantvirya arrives in Lanka. He
stays in the Kusumodyan. Fifty-six thousand celestial Munis reside with him. In
the last watch of the night, Anantvirya Muni attains Kevalgyan. Devas celebrate
his Kevalgyan. The five Kalyanakas of Bhagwan Munisuvrat Jinendra are described
in a prose poem. The divine sound of the Kevali resonates. Indrajit, Meghvahan,
Kumbhakarna and Mandodari inquire about their future births. Finally, Indrajit,
Meghvahan, Bhanukarna and Madhu take Nirgranth Diksha. Mandodari, Chandranakha
and others also take the vows of an Aryika.  **Eighty-ninth Chapter:** Rama and
Lakshmana enter Lanka with great pomp and splendor. Seeing Rama's captivating
form, women praise him to each other. They praise Sita's good fortune. Walking
along the royal road, Rama reaches the garden where Sita, weakened by separation
and suffering, is staying. Sita stands up to welcome Rama. Rama embraces Sita
with his arms. Lakshmana stands respectfully, touching Sita's feet. Tears of
affection flow from Sita's eyes. Devas and Vidyadharas in the sky express their
joy at the reunion of Rama and Sita, showering them with flowers and fragrant
water. The sky resounds with the cry of "Jai Sita! Jai Rama!"  **Ninetieth
Chapter:** Taking Sita with him, Sri Rama rides an elephant and goes to Ravana's
palace. There, in the Shantinath Jinalaya, they offer devotional prayers to
Shantinath Bhagwan. They console Vibhishan and Ravana's family. Vibhishan goes
to his palace and sends his clever queen to invite Sri Rama. Sri Rama, along
with his family, arrives at his palace. Vibhishan welcomes them with an offering
of water.

## Table of Contents  **63-108 Eighty-first Parva**  Kausalya, in Ayodhya,
remains constantly sorrowful due to the separation from her son. Thinking about
the delicate body of her son enduring hardships during his exile, she starts
lamenting. At that time, Narada descends from the sky and approaches her,
inquiring about the reason for her lament. Kausalya explains everything, and
Narada, filled with sorrow, sets out to bring news of Rama, Lakshmana, and
Sita's well-being. Upon reaching Lanka, Narada informs them about the grief of
Kausalya and Sumitra. Hearing about their mothers' sorrow, Rama and Lakshmana
become eager to return to Ayodhya, but Vibhishana, bowing his head at their
feet, requests them to stay for another sixteen days. Rama, somehow, agrees to
Vibhishana's request. Meanwhile, Vibhishana sends skilled artisans to rebuild
Ayodhya and showers the city with abundant jewels. He also sends messengers to
inform Bharata about Rama and Lakshmana's well-being.  **106-117 Eighty-second
Parva** After sixteen days, Rama, mounted on the Pushpaka Vimana, departs for
Ayodhya at sunrise. Along the way, Rama introduces Sita to various significant
places. Upon approaching Ayodhya, Bharata and others welcome them with great
joy. The joy of the men and women of Ayodhya knows no bounds. Along with Rama
and Lakshmana, Sugriva, Hanuman, Vibhishana, Bhamandal, and Viradhit also
arrive. People introduce each other to them. Kausalya and the other four mothers
embrace Rama and Lakshmana. The sons pay their respects to their mothers.
**118-122 Eighty-third Parva** Description of Rama and Lakshmana's glory.
Although Bharata is the master of one hundred and fifty wives and resides in
beautiful palaces filled with luxuries, he remains detached from the world. He
wanted to take initiation even before Rama's exile but couldn't. Now, his
detachment has reached its peak. He has become indifferent to everything that
could bind him to the world. Rama and Lakshmana tried to dissuade him, and
Kaikeyi cried and screamed, but nothing had any effect on him. Rama, Lakshmana,
and Bharata's wives tried to hold him back by tempting him with worldly
pleasures, but they failed. Meanwhile, the Trilokamandan elephant goes berserk
and creates havoc in the city. Despite all efforts, he remains unpacified.
Finally, he calms down upon seeing Bharata.  **123-132**

##  Padma Purana  **Chapter 84**  Trilokamandan, the elephant, is subdued by
Rama and Lakshmana. Sita and Vishalya ride on the elephant and enter the royal
palace. The fear and anxiety caused by the elephant's rampage in the city
subside. Four days later, the mahout approaches Rama and Lakshmana, describing
Trilokamandan's sorrowful state. He says the elephant has not eaten or drunk
anything for four days and continues to breathe heavily in distress.  **Chapter
85**  The Kevali, the embodiment of virtue, arrives in Ayodhya. Joy spreads
everywhere. Everyone goes to pay their respects. The Kevali delivers a sermon.
Lakshmana, seeking answers, asks about the cause of Trilokamandan's distress,
his subsequent calmness, and his refusal to eat or drink. In response, the
Kevali elaborates on the past lives of the elephant and Bharata.  **Chapter 86**
Hearing about his past lives from the mouth of the great sage, Deshbhushan,
Bharata experiences a surge of detachment. He seeks initiation from the sage.
Inspired by Bharata's devotion, over a thousand kings embrace the Digambar path.
After Bharata's departure, his mother, Kaikeyi, is deeply saddened. Though Rama
and Lakshmana console her, she becomes so detached from the world that she seeks
solace by taking the initiation of an Aryika, along with three hundred women.
**Chapter 87**  Trilokamandan, the elephant, attains samadhi and becomes a deity
in the Brahmottara heaven. Bharata, the muni, sheds the eight karmas and attains
nirvana.  **Chapter 88**  Everyone praises Bharata. All the kings perform the
coronation of Rama and Lakshmana. After the coronation, Rama and Lakshmana
divide the kingdoms among the other kings.  **Chapter 89**  Rama and Lakshmana
tell Shatrughna to choose any kingdom he desires. Shatrughna expresses his
desire for Mathura. Rama and Lakshmana warn him about the strength of the king
of Mathura, Madhusundar, and encourage him to choose another kingdom. However,
Shatrughna remains adamant. Rama and Lakshmana, with a large army, send
Shatrughna towards Mathura. Upon reaching Mathura, a fierce battle ensues
between Shatrughna and Madhu. Finally, Madhu, seated on an elephant, is wounded
and, in a state of detachment, plucks out his hair and takes initiation. Seeing
this, Shatrughna falls at his feet and seeks forgiveness. Subsequently,
Shatrughna becomes the king.  **Chapters 133-135, 136-146, 150-152, 153-154,

## Table of Contents  **Ninety-first Parva:** Hearing the news of Madhusundar's
death by Shulratna, Chamendra becomes enraged and spreads a plague in Mathura.
Guided by his Kuldevata, Shatrughna departs for Ayodhya.  **One Hundred and
Sixty-eighth to One Hundred and Seventieth Parva:** Why did Shatrughna have such
a strong affection for Mathura?  Gautam Swami describes Shatrughna's previous
births while answering this question to Shrenik.  **One Hundred and Seventy-
first to One Hundred and Seventy-fifth Parva:** The presence of the seven sages,
including Surmanyu, removes all calamities from Mathurapuri. The sages, perhaps
seeking food, arrive in Ayodhya. Seeing them, Arhaddatta Seth thinks, "I have
paid homage to all the sages around Ayodhya. These sages have come here while
traveling during the rainy season, therefore they are not worthy of receiving
food."  Thinking this, he did not offer them food.  Later, knowing them to be
holders of Charan Riddhi from the words of a sage named Dyuti Bhattarak,
Arhaddatta Seth is deeply saddened by his own shallow intellect.  Knowing
Kartiki Purnima is near, Arhaddatta Seth goes to Mathurapuri and worships the
sages, considering himself blessed.  The same sages receive food at Sita's
house.  **One Hundred and Seventy-sixth to One Hundred and Eighty-second
Parva:** Description of the acquisition of Shridama for Ram and Manorama for
Lakshman.  **One Hundred and Eighty-third to One Hundred and Eighty-seventh
Parva:** Ram and Lakshman subdue many Vidhyadhar kings. Description of

and Ninetieth Parva:** Sita sees in a dream that two octopuses enter her mouth
and she falls from the Pushpak Vimana. Ram, after hearing the interpretation of
the dream, consoles Sita.  Considering the second dream to be a sign of some
misfortune, he performs worship of the Jinenadra Bhagwan in temples for her
peace.  A couplet arises in Sita's mind about the worship of the Jin temples.
Ram fulfills her desire. The temples are decorated and Ram, along with Sita,
visits them.  Vasanta Utsav is celebrated.  **One Hundred and Sixty-first to One
Hundred and Sixty-fifth Parva:** Shri Ram is situated in the Mahendrodya garden.
The chosen people of the kingdom go to Ramchandraji to make some requests, but
they are unable to gather the courage to speak to him.  Sita is also mentally
distressed due to the twitching of the lower part of her right eye.  Following
the advice of her friends, she calms herself and performs a peace ritual in the
temple.  She performs the abhisheka of the Bhagwan and gives the desired
donations.

##  Padma Purana  **12**  In the end, gathering courage, the leading citizens of
the kingdom describe the public slander against Sita to Rama and plead, "Since
you have brought back Sita, abducted by Ravana, the people have become
unrestrained." Hearing this, Rama's heart is deeply pained.  **166-201**  The
89th Parva: Ramachandra calls Lakshmana and tells him about the accusations
against Sita. Lakshmana is enraged upon hearing this and vows to destroy the
wicked. He praises Sita's character to appease Rama's mind. However, fearing
public opinion, Rama decides to abandon Sita. He calls the commander,
Kritantavaktra, and sends Sita to the forest under the pretext of showing her
the Jain temples. In the forest, Kritantavaktra deeply regrets his subservient
nature. Crossing the Ganges, the commander Kritantavaktra delivers Rama's order
to Sita. Sita faints like she was struck by lightning and falls to the ground.
Upon regaining consciousness, she introspects and sends a message to Rama: "Just
as you abandoned me out of fear of public opinion, do not abandon the Jain
Dharma." The commander returns. Sita laments. At that moment, the king of
Pundarika, Vajranjgh, departs from there with his army. Hearing Sita's lament,
his army stops there.  **202-216**  The 89th Parva: Seeing his army stopped,
Vajranjgh asks the reason. Before some soldiers reach Sita, Vajranjgh himself
arrives. Seeing the soldiers, Sita trembles in fear. Mistaking them for thieves,
she offers them her jewels. They comfort her and introduce her to King
Vajranjgh. Sita tells them her entire story, and Vajranjgh consoles her,
accepting her as a righteous woman.  **217-224**  The 90th Parva: Sitting in a
well-decorated palanquin, Sita reaches Pundarika. It takes her three days to
cross the terrifying forest. Vajranjgh keeps Sita in his palace with great
humility and devotion. ... When the commander Kritantavaktra returns to Ayodhya
after leaving Sita in the forest, Rama asks him about Sita's message. The
commander relays Sita's message: "Just as you abandoned me out of fear of public
opinion, do not abandon the devotion to the Jina." ... Considering the harshness
of the forest and Sita's pregnant state, Rama is deeply saddened. Lakshmana
comes and consoles him.  **225-233**  The 100th Parva: Description of Sita's
pregnancy in Vajranjgh's palace. After nine months, Anangalavan and Madanankush
are born to Sita. Due to the virtuousness of these righteous sons, King
Vajranjgh's prosperity continues to grow. A Shraman named Siddhartha educates
both sons.  **234-240**

decides to give his thirty-two daughters, Shashichula etc., born to his queen
Lakshmi, to Anangalavan when they reach the marriageable age. He starts
searching for a suitable bride for Madananakush. After much deliberation, he
sends his envoy to obtain Kanakmala, the daughter born to the Amritavati queen

## Padma Purana - **One Hundred and Fifth Chapter:** Seeing the fiery pit filled
with grass and wood, Rama is distressed. But Lakshmana tells him not to worry
and to witness Sita's greatness. Remembering the five Supreme Beings, Sita jumps
into the fiery pit. As soon as she jumps, the entire fire transforms into water.
The water from the pit spreads out, flooding the people present, causing them to
panic. Finally, the rising water calms down at the touch of Rama's feet. Sita is
seated on a lotus petal. Lava and Kusha reach her side. Ramachandra apologizes
for his offense and urges her to return home. But Sita, having renounced the
world, chooses not to go home and instead takes initiation from the Aryika
Prithivimati. ... Rama goes to Sarvabhusana Kevali. The Kevali, through his
divine voice, explains the Dharma. Hearing the description of the suffering in
the four realms of existence, Rama asks, "Oh Lord! Am I a Bhavy?" In response,
the Kevali says, "You are a Bhavy and will attain liberation from this very
birth." - **One Hundred and Sixth Chapter (279-268):** At Vibhishana's request,

commander of the army of death, Krtaantavaktra, seeks permission from Rama to
take initiation. Rama tells him, "You, who have never tolerated even a crooked
glance in your position as commander, how will you bear the insults of the lowly
as a monk?" In response, the commander says, "When I am capable of giving up the
elixir of your love, how can other things be unbearable?" Rama praises him and
says, "If you attain Nirvana or become a god, do not forget to remember me, who
is caught in delusion." Receiving Rama's command, the commander takes
initiation. When Sarvabhusana Kevali departs, Rama goes to Sita and expresses
his astonishment at her rigorous penance. - **One Hundred and Eighth Chapter
(318-323):** In response to a question from Srenic, Indra-bhuiti Ganadhara

## Padma Purana  **One Hundred and Eighteenth Chapter:** Sugriva, etc., and
Lakshmana inspire the cremation of Lakshmana, but Rama, angered by them, takes
Lakshmana and leaves for another place. Rama bathes Lakshmana's body, tries to
feed him, and adorns him with sandalwood paste, etc. In this state, some enemy
kings from the south advise an attack on Ayodhya and arrive with a large army.
But the former friend of Rama, the commander Krtaantavaktra, and the soul of
Jatayu, who had become a god in heaven, come and destroy this disturbance.
Having removed the enemy disturbance, both of them address Rama in various ways,
due to which Rama cremates Lakshmana's body after six months.  **One Hundred and
Nineteenth Chapter:** Rama, detached from the world, wants to give the kingdom
to Shatrughna, but he refuses to take it. Then, handing over the burden of the
kingdom to his son Anangalavana, he takes the Nirgrantha initiation. At the same
time, Vibhishana, etc., also give their kingdoms to their sons and take
initiation.  **One Hundred and Twentieth Chapter:** The great sage Ramachandra
comes to the city for Charya, but due to an extraordinary disturbance in the
city, he returns to the forest without taking any food.  **One Hundred and
Twenty-First Chapter:** The sage Rama takes a five-day fast and makes a rule
that if he finds food in the forest, he will eat it, otherwise not. King
Pratinanda and Queen Prabhava provide him with food in the forest itself and
make their household life successful.  **One Hundred and Twenty-Second
Chapter:** Rama is absorbed in penance. The soul of Sita, Achyuta, the king of
heaven, knowing from his divine knowledge that Rama is about to attain
liberation from this very birth, tries to distract him out of affection. But all
his efforts are in vain. The great sage Rama attains the क्षपकश्रेणी
(Ksapkashreni) and becomes a Kevali.  **One Hundred and Twenty-Third Chapter:**
The soul of Sita, Pratindra, goes to hell and addresses the soul of Lakshmana.
He gives him religious instruction. He is saddened by his suffering and tries to
get him out of hell, but all his efforts are in vain. ... After getting out of
hell, he goes to the shelter of the Kevali Rama and asks him where the soul of
Dasharatha was born? What is the state of the Bhamandala? What will happen to
Lakshmana, Ravana, etc. in the future? He asks all this. The Kevali Rama answers
him through his divine voice. The Kevali Rama attains Nirvana. ... In the end,
the author, Ravishenacharya, writes his own praise.  **One Hundred and Twenty-
Fourth Chapter:** ...

The Padma Purana, also known as the Pacharita, composed by the venerable Acharya
Shrimad Ravishena, Chapter 66.  **Verse 1:** Hearing the news of Lakshmana's
recovery, as befitting the character of Vishalya, Ravana was filled with both
wonder and envy.  **Verse 2:** He smiled faintly and asked, "What harm is
there?" Then, he turned to his ministers, skilled in mantras, like Mrigaanka.
**Verse 3:** "O Lord," they said, "I speak the truth and what is beneficial to
you. Whether you are pleased or displeased, it is the duty of servants to offer
fearless advice for your benefit."  **Verse 4:** "O Lord, you have seen that
Rama and Lakshmana, through the power of their virtuous deeds, have effortlessly
obtained the knowledge of the lion-borne and Garuda-borne celestial vehicles."
**Verse 5:** "You have also seen that their brother, Kumbhakarna, and their two
sons are bound, and the divine power of the most powerful celestial being has
been rendered useless."  **Verse 6:** "Even if you conquer your enemy, know for
certain that the destruction of your brothers and sons is inevitable."  **Verse
7:** "O Lord, we beseech you to be gracious to us, knowing this. You have never
before disregarded our words of advice, which are for your benefit."  **Verse
8:** "Abandon Sita and embrace your former righteous wisdom. May all beings,
protected by you, be prosperous and well."  **Verse 9:** "Make peace with Rama,
speaking sweetly. There is no harm in doing so, but only great benefit."
**Verse 10:** "You are the protector of all the norms of the world. You are the
source of all righteousness, like the ocean is the source of all jewels."
**Verse 1-2:** Then, Ravana, after hearing from his spies about Lakshmana's
recovery, as befitting the character of Vishalya, was filled with both wonder
and envy. He smiled faintly and asked, "What harm is there?" Then, he turned to
his ministers, skilled in mantras, like Mrigaanka.  **Verse 3-10:** "O Lord,"
they said, "I speak the truth and what is beneficial to you. Whether you are
pleased or displeased, it is the duty of servants to offer fearless advice for
your benefit."  "O Lord, you have seen that Rama and Lakshmana, through the
power of their virtuous deeds, have effortlessly obtained the knowledge of the
lion-borne and Garuda-borne celestial vehicles."  "You have also seen that their

"Abandon Sita and embrace your former righteous wisdom. May all beings,

In the Padma Purana, Having said this, the aged ministers, with their hands
folded in salutation, bowed their heads.  Seeing their confusion, Dashaanan
(Ravana) raised them up and said, "I will do as you say."  ||11|| Then, the
ministers, who were well-versed in mantras, were pleased and instructed a very
handsome and wise Samanta (minister) to be the messenger.  ||12|| Ravana,
recognizing the messenger's intelligence and ability to understand subtle hints,
quickly conveyed his message through gestures.  ||13|| The message given by the
ministers, though beautiful, was corrupted by Ravana's intentions, just as
poison contaminates a great medicine.  ||14|| Then, the Samanta, who was as wise
as Shukracharya, possessed great strength and prowess, was a kingmaker, and
skilled in pleasing speech, bowed to his master, pleased, and prepared to
depart.  He, with his sharp intellect, saw all beings as insignificant as the
dust under a cow's foot.  ||15-16|| As he departed, a fearsome army, adorned
with various weapons, and seemingly created by his intellect, followed him
without fear.  ||17|| Hearing the sound of the messenger's trumpet, the Vanara
(monkey) soldiers were agitated and, fearing Ravana's arrival, looked up at the
sky.  ||18|| When the messenger drew near, and it was understood that he was not
Ravana but a mere human, the Vanara army regained their composure.  ||19|| The
messenger, having been informed by the gatekeeper of Videha, and having
stationed his soldiers outside the camp, arrived with a few close associates.
||20|| Seeing Padma, he bowed, performed the duties of a messenger, and,
standing for a moment, spoke in a measured tone.  ||21|| He said, "O Padma! My
master, Ravana, speaks to you through my words. Please make an effort to listen
attentively for a moment."  ||22|| "He says that he has no need for war in this
matter. Many men, proud of war, have met their destruction."  ||23||

## The Sixty-Sixth Chapter  **24.**  The destruction of people is the result of
war, not the attainment of any good fortune.  The greatest fault is failure in
war, and even if victory is achieved, it is always accompanied by many
drawbacks.  **25.**  Those who were driven by the desire for war, like Duvritta,
Naraka, Shankha, Dhavalanga, and Shambara, have all perished.  **26.**  It is in
your best interest to be friendly with me.  Just as a lion finds happiness in a
cave, so too will you find happiness in our friendship.  **27.**  He who, in
battle, terrified the gods, even Indra, the king of the gods, and imprisoned him
in a cell fit for a common criminal.  **28.**  He whose movement is at his will,
in the netherworld, on earth, and in the sky, and whom even the angry gods and
demons cannot defeat.  **29.**  I, Ravana, the ten-headed one, who has captured
the goddess of fortune in many great battles, have you never heard of me?
**30.**  O King, I give you this entire earth, extending to the ocean, along
with the Vidyadharas, and I also give you half of Lanka.  **31.**  Today, send
my brother and sons with a good heart, and agree to give me Sita.  This will
bring you prosperity.  **32.**  If you do not do this, how can you expect to
prosper?  Sita is already in our possession, and we will forcibly take back our
brothers and sons who are bound in battle.  **33.**  Padmanabha then said, "I
have no desire for your kingdom, nor for other women or great pleasures."
**34.**  "O ten-headed one, if you send Sita back to me with the utmost respect,
I will send your brother and both your sons immediately."  **35.**  "With Sita
by my side, I will wander happily in the forest, a place frequented by deer and
other animals.  You, however, may enjoy the entire earth."  **36.**  "O
messenger, go and tell the lord of Lanka this.  This is the only path to his
well-being, there is no other way."  **37.**  Hearing these words of Padmanabha,
which were praised by all and spoken with grace, the messenger, the king's
minister, spoke.  **38.**  "O King, you have crossed the terrible ocean without
fear, and you have come here to do a great good deed.  Why are you afraid?"

---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, Your hope for Janaki is not at all auspicious. Even if you
were to be in the company of the king of Lanka, give up all hope for your life.
||36|| A wise man should always protect himself, even from his wives and wealth.
||40|| Even if the lord of the Garuda has sent you two vehicles, or if you have
bound my sons and brothers by deceit, what is this inflated ego of yours?
Because while I am alive, you will not achieve your goal. ||41-42|| If you
strive in battle, you will neither get Sita nor will your life remain.
Therefore, do not be corrupted on both sides, give up your stubbornness
regarding Sita. ||43|| In all the scriptures, I have caused the death of great
celestial kings like Indra. ||44|| Look at these piles of bones, like the peaks
of Kailasa, of the kings who have been destroyed by the strength of my arms.
||45|| Thus, when the messenger spoke, the radiant sun, illuminating the sky
with the brilliance of his face, spoke in anger, "Oh, wicked messenger! Oh,
jackal! Skilled in fabricating words! Oh, foolish one! Why are you babbling like
this without any fear?" ||46-47|| What is the talk about Sita? Who is this vile
demon Ravana, like a beast, who is engaged in vile deeds, to slander Rama?
||48|| As soon as the sun said this, he drew his sword, but Lakshmana, the
keeper of the eyes of righteousness, stopped him. ||46|| The sun's eyes, which
were like red lotus petals, became corrupted by anger and took on the form of
twilight - they became red like twilight. ||50|| Just as a great serpent,
manifesting the brilliance of its venom, is pacified by a mantra, so too was the
sun gradually pacified by the good advice of his ministers. ||51|| The ministers
said, "Oh, king! Give up your anger, which has arisen in an inappropriate
matter. Even if this messenger is killed, what is the purpose?"

## The Sixty-Sixth Chapter  The wise, who is skilled in crushing elephants with
the force of the monsoon clouds, does not get agitated by a mouse, even if it
has moving whiskers.  ||53||  What anger can a righteous person have towards
echoes, wooden puppets, birds like parrots, or mechanical human figures?  ||54||
Thus, being spoken to by Lakshmana, the son of Janaka, became calm.  Then, the
fearless messenger, free from fear, spoke to Padma again.  ||55||  You are being
misled by these foolish and wicked ministers, who are entangled in evil
practices and are full of doubts.  ||56||  Understand that you are being
deceived by them and, with your own wise intellect, consider what is beneficial
for you.  ||57||  Abandon your association with Sita, become the lord of all the
worlds, and, riding the Pushpaka chariot, adorned with wealth, roam freely as
you please.  ||58||  Give up your false pride, do not listen to the words of
petty people, and focus your mind on what needs to be done.  You will become
supremely happy.  ||59||  Thinking, "Who will answer this petty person?", Janaka
remained silent, but others severely rebuked the messenger.  ||60||  Pierced by
sharp words like arrows and subjected to utter disrespect, the messenger, deeply
distressed, went to his master.  ||61||  There, he reported, "O Lord! Following
your command and guided by your influence, I spoke to Rama in a manner
consistent with the principles of diplomacy.  ||62||  I offered you the earth,
filled with diverse kingdoms, rich in precious mines, and adorned with celestial
dancers, along with mighty elephants, horses, chariots, and the Pushpaka
chariot, which even the gods cannot despise.  ||63||

I offer you three thousand beautiful maidens along with their retinue, a throne
that shines like the sun, and an umbrella that resembles the moon. Or what more
can be said on this matter? If Sita accepts me by your command, then enjoy this
entire, thornless kingdom. ||62-66||  O wise one! If you do what we say, we will
be content with a simple mat made of reeds and a meager livelihood. ||67||
Although I repeatedly said these words to him, he does not abandon his stubborn
attachment to Sita. His devotion lies solely in her. ||68||  Just as the conduct
of a truly peaceful sage is dear, so too is Sita dear to Rama. O master! Forget
about your kingdom, even if you offered the three worlds, no one could separate
that beautiful woman from him. ||69||  And Rama said to you, "O Dashaanan! It is
not fitting for you to engage in such an act condemned by all." ||70||  Why
haven't the tongues of you, a wicked and lowly man, been torn into a hundred
pieces for speaking in this manner? ||71||  I have no need for the pleasures of
Indra without Sita. You may enjoy the entire earth, and I will dwell in the
forest. ||72||  If you are determined to die for the sake of another man's wife,
then why shouldn't I strive for my own beloved? ||73||  O beautiful one! Enjoy
all the maidens in the world. I, who eat fruits and leaves, will wander only
with Sita. ||74||  The messenger continues to speak to Ravana, "My lord!
Sugriva, the king of the monkeys, mocked you and said that your master seems to
be under the control of some demon." ||75||  Or perhaps your master is afflicted
by a very strong wind, which causes him to speak nonsense. This is the reason
why he is behaving so strangely. ||76||  It seems that there are no skilled
physicians or spellcasters in Lanka, otherwise they would surely have treated
him with remedies like heated oil and other wind-expelling substances. ||77||
Or perhaps Lakshmana, the physician of poisons, will quickly cure all his
ailments with arrows in the battlefield, which is like a circle. ||78||  Then,
my heart, burning with anger at his insults, will become like a lion, and the
eight monkey-bannered moons will become like eight lions. ||79||

## The Sixty-Sixth Chapter  **Sughreeva!** You surely wish to die by the pride
of your heart. You are insulting the lord of the Vidyadharas in anger. ||80||
Viradhit has also told you, if you have the strength, come, fight me alone. Why
are you sitting? ||81|| I told Dasharatha's son again, "O Rama! Have you not
seen Ravana's supreme valor in the battlefield?" ||82|| You wish to bring him to
his senses, who is like the sun to the fireflies that are the kings, who is a
hero, whose fame is known throughout the three worlds, who is currently merciful
due to your auspicious influence, who is generous, and who loves the humble.
||83-84|| Do you wish to swim across the ocean that is Ravana, who is filled
with waves of fierce armies and a multitude of weapons like aquatic creatures?
||85|| How do you intend to enter the impenetrable forest of Ravana, which is
filled with ferocious beasts and dense trees of foot soldiers? ||86||  **The
Lineage**  The Sumeru mountain is not lifted by the wind, the ocean does not dry
up by the rays of the sun, the earth does not tremble by the horns of the bull,
and Ravana is not conquered by those like you. ||87||  **The Sub-Lineage**
While I was speaking thus, Bhamandala, with eyes red with anger, was about to
draw his shining sword, but he was stopped by Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra.
||88|| Lakshmana said to Bhamandala, "O son of Videha! Calm down, a lion does
not get angry at a jackal, he plays with a string of pearls by tearing the chest
of an elephant." ||89||  **The King**  Those who possess great strength and
valor do not attack the fearful, the Brahmanas, the ascetics, the unarmed, the
women, the children, the animals, or the messengers. ||90||  Thus, I rebuked him
in the same way a dog rebukes an elephant. ||76||

In the Padma Purana, when the wise Lakshmana, adorned with auspicious qualities,
gently reasoned with him, the one who bore the unbearable wheel of brilliance,
gradually relinquished his anger. ||11||  The wicked Kumaras, filled with
malice, scorned him with words like thunderbolts. His soul, crushed by
unprecedented causes, considered itself as insignificant as a blade of grass.
||12||  Driven by fear, I ascended to the sky and have returned to your feet. O
God! If Lakshmana had not been there, I would have surely perished at the hands
of Bhammandala. ||13||  O God! I have recounted the character of the enemy as I
have experienced it, without any hesitation. Do what is right, for we, like me,
are only those who follow orders. ||14||  Gautama Swami says, O Shrenik! Even
those who are well-versed in many groups of scriptures, who are always engaged
in matters of ethics, and who have good ministers by their side, become subject
to delusion when they are enveloped by the dense clouds of delusion of the sun-
like man. ||15||  Thus ends the sixty-sixth chapter of the Padma Purana, known
as Ravana's Messenger's Arrival and Departure, narrated by the sage Ravishena.
||66||  And they do not attack the messenger. ||60||

The sixty-seventh chapter: Hearing the words of his messenger, the lord of the
Rakshasas, after a moment's deliberation with his ministers, the wise men,
placed his hand on his cheek, shining with the light of his earrings, and sat
down with his face downcast, lost in thought.  If I win the battle against the
enemy, who are united like a herd of elephants, then the loss of the Kumaras is
evident. Therefore, when the enemy force is asleep, I should attack them
secretly and bring back the Kumaras. Or what should I do? What will bring about
my welfare?  Thus, while he was pondering, this thought arose in the mind of the
king of Magadha, making his heart happy. I will attain the great knowledge,
known as Bahurupi, which even the gods, who are always vigilant, cannot
obstruct.  Thinking thus, he quickly summoned his servants and commanded them:
"Quickly, decorate the peaceful abode with beautiful toranas and other
ornaments. And perform the worship of the Jina in all the temples, equipped with
all the necessary paraphernalia. He entrusted the entire responsibility of the
arrangements for the worship to Mandodari, who was of a noble mind.  The time of
the great rise of the Lord Munisuvrata, worshipped by gods and demons, had
arrived. At that time, this vast land of Bharat was adorned with the holy images
of the Arhant.  The kings, the rulers of the land, and the wealthy merchants,
erected magnificent Jina temples, shining brightly.  These temples were presided
over by the righteous gods of the kingdom, who were devoted to the protection of
the righteous path and were auspicious.  The people of the land, always
prosperous, performed abhisheka and worship in them, and the glorious beings
always worshipped them. These Jina temples were as beautiful as the celestial
chariots of heaven.  O King! At that time, on every mountain, in every beautiful
village, in every forest, in every port, in every city, in every town,

10 Padmapurana In villages, forests, towns, cities, palaces, and cities, at
every confluence and beautiful intersection, there were Jain temples adorned
with great splendor. || 14-15 || These temples were radiant like the autumn
moon, melodious with the sound of music, and resonated with the sound of the
ocean, stirred by the sounds of various musical instruments. || 16 || These
temples were filled with groups of virtuous people eager to offer prayers at all
three times of the day, were profound, accompanied by various teachers, and
adorned with offerings of various flowers. || 17 || They were endowed with
supreme splendor, glittering with the brilliance of jewels of various colors,
very spacious, tall, and adorned with large flags. || 18 || In these temples,
there were statues of the Jinas made of gold, silver, and other materials,
adorned with five colors, and accompanied by their families. || 19 || The peak
of Mount Vijayardha was adorned with the beautiful Jain temples built in the
city of the Vidyadharas at every location. || 20 || This entire world was filled
with auspicious and beautiful Jain temples, adorned with gardens, made of
various jewels, and was extremely beautiful. || 21 || Lanka, like the city of
Indra, was also extremely beautiful, both inside and outside, with Jain temples
that destroyed sins. || 22 || Gautama Swami says that Dasanana, whose radiance
was like that of a rain cloud, whose arms were long like an elephant's trunk,
whose face was like the full moon, whose lips were red like the midday flower,
who was himself beautiful, whose eyes were large, whose movements were
captivating to women's hearts, whose form was like that of Lakshmīdhara-
Lakshmana, and who was endowed with a divine form, played with his eighteen
thousand wives, who were like lotuses, like the sun. || 23-25 || In the house of
Dasanana, which was surrounded by a row of other palaces, made of various
jewels, and adorned with chaityas, and on which the eyes of all people were
fixed, there was a peaceful house in the middle, which was spacious, radiant,
and adorned with thousands of golden pillars, where the peaceful Jina, the Lord
of Peace, was established. || 26 || 1. समाकुलः म० ।

## The Sixty-Seventh Chapter  **The Praise of the Tri-Lokeshwaras**  **Verse
27:** Blessed are those who, knowing all things to be impermanent, fix their
minds firmly on Dharma and build magnificent temples for the Jinas in this
world. Their temples are adorned with the brilliance of the Jinas, whose feet
shine brighter than the gems adorning the crowns of the Indras.  **The Story of
the Up-Caste**  **Verse 28:** Wise men say that the fruit of wealth is the
attainment of merit. Jain Dharma is the supreme treasure in this entire world,
illuminating the desired object like the sun.  **Thus ends the Sixty-Seventh
Chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the "Shanti Griha Kirtan," narrated by
Acharya Ravishena.**  **Note:**  * The text refers to the "Shanti Griha Kirtan,"
which is a section within the Padma Purana. * The term "Tri-Lokeshwaras" refers
to the Jinas, who are the masters of the three worlds (heaven, earth, and hell).
* The term "Up-Caste" is a translation of "Up-Jati," which refers to a higher
social class.

The eighth festival of the sixty-four festivals, the Nandishvara Ashtahnika,
began on the eighth day of the bright fortnight of the month of Phalguna and
continued till the full moon. ||1|| Upon the arrival of this Nandishvara
festival, people from both sides of the army, filled with utmost joy, became
eager to observe the vows. ||2|| All the soldiers thought in their minds that
these eight days are extremely sacred in all the three worlds. ||3|| We will not
engage in war during these days, nor will we commit any other kind of violence,
but will remain devoted to our own welfare and worship the Jina as much as we
can. ||4|| During these days, even the gods abstain from enjoyment and, along
with the Indras, remain devoted to the worship of the Jina. ||5|| Devotees, with
golden pitchers filled with the water of the ocean of milk and adorned with
lotuses, perform the abhisheka of the Jina. ||6|| Others should also perform the
abhisheka of the Jina with unmatched images, made of leaves, etc., if pitchers
are not available, with devotion. ||7|| If the Indras, going to the Nandishvara
island, worship the Jina with devotion, then are the Jinas not worthy of worship
by the lowly humans residing here? ||8|| If the gods worship the Jinas with
jewels and golden lotuses, then the poor humans on earth should also worship
them with the lotus of the mind, if nothing else. ||9|| Thus, the people who had
attained meditation, adorned the beautiful temples in the Lanka island with
flags, etc., with great enthusiasm. ||10|| Magnificent assemblies, water-
fountains, platforms, scripture halls, beautiful drama halls, and large gardens
were constructed. ||11|| Many beautiful lakes, adorned with lotuses, were
shining with excellent steps and whose banks were adorned with temples made of
cloth, etc. ||12|| The temples were adorned with various kinds of mandalas made
of gold dust, etc., and with excellent doors decorated with cloth, banana trees,
etc. ||13|| The pitchers, filled with ghee, milk, etc., had lotuses covering
their mouths, and were adorned with jewels and rays of light. ||14||

The Eighty-sixth Festival  Hundreds and thousands of kalashas, adorned with
strings of pearls, shining with the radiance of gems, and decorated with various
ornaments, were seen in the homes of the householders, gathered for the
abhisheka of the Jina images. [14-15]  In the temples, garlands made of
Karnikar, Ati-muktak, Kadamba, Sahakar, Champaka, Parijataka, and Mandara
flowers, all born in the Nandana forest, were adorned, their fragrance
attracting swarms of bees. [16-17]  The Sri Jinendra Deva was worshipped with
excellent offerings of lotuses made of gold, silver, and gems. [18]  The temples
resounded with the loud sounds of excellent drums, trumpets, mridanga, conch
shells, and other instruments. [19]  The Lankans, their mutual animosity
extinguished and united in great joy, manifested the supreme glory of the
Jinendra Deva. [20]  Just as the Devas in Nandishvara Dvipa, eager to worship
the Jina images, manifest great glory, so too did the Vidyaadharas, devoted to
devotion, manifest great glory. [21]  Ravana, the great hero, went to the Shanti
Jin-alaya and, becoming pure, performed a beautiful worship of the Sri Jinendra
Deva, just as Bali Raja had done before, with devotion. [22]  Gautama Swami
says, "Who is capable of describing the accumulation of merit of those men who,
endowed with appropriate wealth and bearing the burden of excellent devotion,
worship the Sri Jinendra Deva?" [23]  Such beings, enjoying the wealth of the
Devas, obtaining the good fortune of the Chakravarti's enjoyments, and finally
performing austerities greater than the Sun, attain the supreme liberation,
following the Jain path. [24]  Thus ends the Eighty-sixth Festival, which
describes the glory of the Ashtahnika of the Phalguna month, as narrated by the
Acharya Ravishena in the Padma Purana, known as the Aarsha. [18]  1. Chaitya,
etc. [2. Golden] [3. Great sounds]

The 76th chapter. Hail to Shantinath, whose abode is the cause of peace. It is
like the peak of Mount Kailash, resembling a cluster of autumn clouds. (1) It is
self-luminous, divine, surrounded by a row of palaces, and situated in the
middle of Jambudvipa, like Mount Meru. (2) With a mind filled with the means of
knowledge, and with firm determination, Ravana entered and performed a most
wonderful worship of Shantinath. (3) With abhishekas, musical instruments, very
beautiful garlands, incense, offerings of food, and unguents of excellent color,
(4) the ten-headed Ravana, with a peaceful mind, performed the worship of
Shantinath with great splendor, like a dog eager for a bone. (5) With a crown of
hair adorned with a jewel, a radiant crown, wearing white clothes, with thick
arms adorned with bracelets, (6) with folded hands, pressing the earth with his
knees, he bowed to Shantinath with three-fold prostration. (7) Standing before
peace, on the pure earth, with his limbs arranged on a seat, on a carpet of
flowers, (8) holding a rosary of crystal beads in his hand, resembling a cluster
of blue clouds with rows of lightning, (9) with concentrated meditation, his
eyes fixed on the tip of his nose, the king of the Rakshasas began to seek
knowledge. (10) Then Mandodari, who had been instructed by the Lord, ordered her
minister named Yamadanda, saying, "Let a proclamation be made everywhere, so
that people everywhere may be devoted to the rules and regulations, and may be
filled with great compassion." (11-12) Let the worship of the Jina be performed,
abandoning all other activities, and let wealth be given to those who ask,
without envy, as they desire. (13) As long as the yoga is not completed, let the
people remain restrained, being devoted to faith. (14)

you, a strong person should definitely endure it. ||15||  Whoever shows anger in
these days, even if he is a father, what to speak of others, he will be my
enemy. ||16||  Whoever is not a follower of this order, even if he is endowed
with knowledge and meditation, will be bound to the endless cycle of birth and
death. He will not be liberated. ||17||  Then, saying "As you command," with
haste and joy, Mandodari's minister, Yamadanda, announced it. All the people,
free from doubt, carried out the order. ||18||  Gautama Swami says that all the
people of Lanka, who reside in the most excellent palaces, shining like the sun,
and who possess pure and elevated thoughts, abandoned all other activities and
became absorbed in the worship of the Jina. ||16||  Thus ends the sixty-seventh

The Seventy-Seventh Chapter 9 This news was heard from the spies. The celestial
kings, eager for victory, said: "It is heard that the lord of Lanka, Ravana, has
entered the refuge of the Shantinath Jinendra and is engaged in attaining the
Bahurupi Vidya." ||19|| This Vidya is attained in twenty-four days and is
capable of breaking the pride of even the gods. ||3|| Therefore, before this
Vidya is attained by him, go quickly and arouse the anger of Ravana, who is
seated in meditation. ||4|| Once this Vidya is attained, he will not be
conquered even by the Indras, let alone us, who are insignificant. ||5|| Then
Vibhishana said: "If this deed is to be done, then let it be started quickly.
Why are you delaying?" ||6|| After deliberation, all the celestial kings said to
Rama: "On this occasion, let Lanka be taken." ||7|| Let Ravana be bound and let
the desired action be taken. Thus, being told, the valiant Rama, who was engaged
in the deeds of great men, said: "Even against those who are extremely fearful,
it is not proper to commit violence. How then can it be proper to commit this
evil against one who is seated in the temple of the Jina, observing vows?" ||8||
This conduct is not praiseworthy for Kshatriyas who are born in noble families,
who are proud and who have practiced the use of weapons. ||10|| Our lord Rama is
a great soul and will not engage in unrighteousness. Thus, having decided, they
secretly sent their sons towards Lanka. ||11|| Even after deciding, "We will go
tomorrow," the celestial kings remained in deliberation for eight days. ||12||
Then, on the day of the full moon, with faces like the full moon, with eyes like
lotuses, and adorned with various auspicious marks, they...

The Seventy-Seventh Chapter  The Vidyaadhara Kumaras, adorned with various
flags, mounted on chariots drawn by lions, tigers, boars, elephants, and
Sharabha, and on Vimanas, proceeded towards Lanka, fearless and with respect. At
that time, those monkey Kumaras, bearing the best weapons and filled with the
desire to anger Ravana, were shining like the gods who dwell in the celestial
mansions. 13-15.  The names of some of the Kumaras are as follows: Makaradhwaja,
Satop, Chandraabha, Vaatayan, GuruBhar, SuryaJyoti, MahaRath, PreetiKakar,
DridhaRath, SamunnataBala, Nandan, Sarvada, Dusht, Singh, Sarvapriya, Nal, Neel,
SagaraNishwan, PurnaChandra with his son, Skanda, ChandraMarichi, Jambavan,
Sankat, SamadhiBahul, SinghKati, IndraAshani, and Bala. Each of their chariots
was drawn by a hundred horses. 16-16.  The remaining Kumaras, with their supreme
valor, proceeded towards Lanka on vehicles resembling lions, boars, elephants,
and tigers, as swift as thought, while the foot soldiers stood in their ranks.
20.  Their banners bore various emblems, and they were marked with various
toranas. They were adorned with colorful victory flags, and their army, like a
vast ocean, filled the sky with its deep roar. They carried themselves with
dignity and were extremely exalted. 21-22.  Reaching the outskirts of Lanka,
they pondered, "What a wonder! This Lanka is at peace." 23.  The inhabitants of
this Lanka appear to be healthy and calm, and their warriors are stationed as if
they have never experienced war before. 24.  Oh, the immense courage, the
profound composure, and the strength enhanced by Lakshmi and prowess of the Lord
of Lanka! 25.  Although the mighty Kumbhakarna, Indrajit, and Meghanada are
imprisoned, and many valiant warriors, including Aksha, who were invincible even
to the strongest, have been slain in battle, this king does not seem to have any
fear. 26-27.  Thinking thus and conversing among themselves, the Kumaras were
filled with immense wonder, as if they were apprehensive. 28.  1. Dyotimaharatha

The Seventy-Seventh Chapter  The mighty demon Maya, filled with rage and adorned
with armor, quickly set out for battle, accompanied by his armored ministers.
His spirit soared high.  He reached the palace of the king of Lanka, the abode
of the glorious Harinakeshi, like the sun.    Mandodi, his daughter, rebuked him
severely, saying, "Father, this is not your duty.  Do not plunge into the ocean
of sin."    "Have you not heard the proclamation of the Jain dharma?  If you
desire your own well-being, then be merciful and calm."  Hearing his daughter's
words, which were for his own good, the demon king Maya calmed down and
restrained his weapons, like the sun retracting its rays.    Covered in
impenetrable armor, adorned with jeweled earrings, and his chest adorned with a
necklace, Maya entered his own Jain temple.    Meanwhile, the princes,
resembling surging oceans, arrived, their speed like the wind, stripping the
palace of its towers.    These valiant princes, eager for great destruction,
broke through the fortified gates of the tall tower and entered the city.    As
they arrived, the city was filled with cries of "They've come!  Run!  Where
shall I go?  Enter your homes!  Alas, mother, what has happened?  Father,
father, look!  Good people, save us!  Brother, what, what?  Why, why?  Noble
son, return, stay!  Alas, alas, great fear!"    The city was filled with the
terrified cries of its people, overwhelmed by the fear of the ten-headed demon.
One woman, in her extreme panic, stumbled over her fallen garment, tripped over
it with her own foot, and fell to the ground, her knees broken.    Another
woman, her clothes slipping from her grasp, was in a state of utter panic,
holding her child close, ready to flee.    Yet another woman, her large pearls
scattered in her haste, was running like a swift cloud, a streak of lightning.
The sounds of panic and fear echoed throughout the city.

## Padma Purana  **57.** A woman, like a streak of lightning, was running away,
showering a multitude of pearls.  **58.** A woman, with eyes like a frightened
deer and hair scattered, clung to her beloved's chest, her trembling subsided.
**59.** Seeing the people terrified, the Deva's of the Shaasana, residing in the
Shanti Prasada, were filled with compassion and, determined to protect their
own, quickly became doorkeepers, preventing anyone from entering.  **60-63.**
Emerging from the Shanti Chaitya, they took on terrifying forms, adorned with
various ornaments, their mouths filled with rows of teeth, their eyes like the
midday sun, filled with anger and venom, their lips curled, their bodies
massive, roaring with various sounds. Their very presence filled the enemy with
fear and confusion, causing the monkey army to flee in terror.  **64.** These
Deva's could transform into lions, fire, clouds, elephants, serpents, wind, and
mountains in an instant.  **65-66.** Seeing the monkey army defeated by the
Deva's residing in the Shanti Prasada, the Deva's residing in the Jinalaya, who
were concerned for the welfare of the monkeys, also came to the battlefield,
transforming themselves into various forms. It is only natural, for the Deva's
who reside in their own places are the protectors of those places.  **67.** As
the Deva's engaged in a fierce battle, their transformations caused doubt even
in the minds of those who were naturally inclined towards truth.  **68-69.**
Seeing his own Deva's defeated, the other Deva's powerful, and the arrogant
monkeys marching towards Lanka, the supremely powerful and wise Yaksha king,
Purnabhadra, addressed the Yaksha, Manibhadra, in a fit of rage.  **70.** "Look
at these merciless monkeys, who, despite knowing all the scriptures, have fallen
prey to their vices."

## The Seventy-Seventh Chapter  21  Those who are eager to kill the peaceful-
hearted, who are engaged in evil deeds, who are small and strike at the weak
points, who are devoid of heroic deeds, should be abandoned. ||72||  Then Mani-
bhadra, who was like Purna-bhadra, spoke. He said, "The hero who is imbued with
the spirit of right conduct, who is a devotee of the feet of the Jina, who is
adorned with excellent qualities, who is peaceful and radiant, even Indra could
not defeat Ravana. What to speak of these?" ||73-74||  Then, Purna-bhadra, the
radiant one, said, "So be it." Thus, the two Yaksha-indras, who were the
destroyers of obstacles, were born. ||75||  Seeing the two Yaksha-indras ready
for battle, the other gods, filled with shame and fear, went to their respective
places. ||76||  The two Yaksha-indras, driven by a great wind, rained down
stones, and roared like thunderclouds at the end of an epoch. ||77||  The army
of the Vidyadharas, driven by the wind from the thighs of the Yaksha-indras,
became like a heap of dry leaves, that is, they fled in fear. ||78||  Chasing
after the fleeing monkeys, the two Yaksha-indras came to Rama, intending to
rebuke him. ||79||  Purna-bhadra, the wise one, praised Rama, saying, "You are
the son of the glorious King Dasharatha. ||80||  You are always free from
unworthy deeds and always engaged in good deeds. You have reached the shore of
the ocean of scriptures and are elevated by pure qualities. ||81||  O Bhadra!
Being so powerful, is it right that your army has destroyed the citizens of the
city?" ||82||  "Whoever takes away the wealth earned by another's effort, takes
away his life, for wealth is said to be external life." ||83||  "Your people
have destroyed Lanka, which is filled with priceless diamonds, sapphires,
pearls, and corals, and have made its women distraught." ||84||  Then,
Lakshmana, who was like a full-blown blue lotus, who was skilled in all the
scriptures, spoke with a powerful voice. ||85||  He said, "This wife of Raghu-
chandra, who is a repository of great qualities and adorned with virtue, is more
precious than his life. ||86||  That demon, by deceit, took her away. How can
you have compassion for Ravana?" ||87||

22 Padmapurana What wrong have we done to you, or what good has he done to you?
Tell us, O Lord of the Guhyakas, even a tiny bit. ||88|| With a crooked and
fierce frown on his forehead, like the red glow of the evening, you are angry, O
Lord of the Yakshas, and have come here without any reason. ||86|| Giving him an
offering with a golden cup, Sugriva, the king of the monkeys, said, "O Lord of
the Yakshas, be pacified!" ||60|| See with equanimity the strength of our army
and the state of the ocean of Lanka's army, which has been witnessed by the very
Itipanas. ||61|| Even so, the lord of the Rakshasas, Ravana, is still trying. By
whom was he ever conquerable before? And now that he has mastered the art of
assuming many forms, what can be said? ||12|| Just as those who argue are
defeated by the learned in the Jain scriptures, so too are the kings defeated by
the enraged Ravana in battle. ||33|| Therefore, I will provoke Ravana, who is
sitting calmly, because just as a person with false vision cannot attain Siddhi,
so too cannot a common man attain knowledge while he is agitated. ||64|| Our aim
in provoking Ravana is to become equal in strength to him, so that we can fight
him on equal terms. Otherwise, our battle with him will be unequal. ||65|| Then,
Purnabhadra said, "It may be so, but O virtuous one, even a tiny bit of
suffering should not be inflicted on Lanka." ||66|| Without causing him any
pain, etc., try to provoke him by keeping his body well. But I think Ravana will
be very difficult to provoke. ||67|| Saying this, the two lords of the Yakshas,
whose eyes were filled with joy, who were affectionate towards the noble ones,
who were devoted to the Sangha of the Shramanas, who were always eager to serve
them, and who had faces as bright as the moon, praised Rama, saying,  1. Abhi =
spear. 2. Kin nu ma. 3. Nadyaapi ma. 4. Evamuktau ma.   7

Lakshmana, those two, Sulājita and Sujita, became greatly ashamed. They sat down

freedom from fault, there is great affection from those who are close. Who

The Seventy-First Chapter  Knowing the peaceful Yaksha king, the son of the
carpenter, Sundara, was extremely eager to see the city of Dasanana.  ||1||  He
was mounted on a magnificent elephant named Kishkindhakanda, whose radiance was
like that of a great cloud, adorned with pearl garlands, shining with white
chowries, and resounding with the sound of great bells. ||2||  He shone like the
full moon on the back of a cloud. ||3||  The princes, Skanda, Indra, Nila, and
others, all adorned with great wealth, were also eager to go, mounted on horses
and other steeds. ||4||  Foot soldiers, countless in number, their bodies
anointed with sandalwood, their lips red with betel, adorned with beautiful
garlands of flowers, their arms shining with bracelets, their swords resting on
their shoulders, their earrings dangling, wearing beautiful and varied garments,
their crowns adorned with golden threads, their movements graceful, their speech
full of pride, and their radiance great, marched ahead of the princes. ||5-7||
Skilled musicians played flutes, lutes, mridangas, and other instruments, and
performed graceful dances in front of the princes. ||8||  The sound of the soft,
melodious trumpets, skillfully played, combined with the sound of conch shells,
rose up like the roar of a war-trumpet. ||9||  Then, adorned with ornaments and
full of joy, the princes entered Lanka, a city like the city of the gods, like
playful Asura princes. ||10||  When the women of Lanka saw Angada, who was
adorned with great glory, entering the city, they said to each other, ||11||
"Oh, friend, look! In one ear, he wears a beautiful, delicate, and pure
talapatrika made of ivory, and in the other ear, he wears a dazzling, sparkling,
and playful pearl earring, which shines like the combined radiance of all the
planets. ||12-13||

The Seventy-First Chapter  This Angada, skilled in creating the unparalleled
moonlight, has risen in the city of Dasamukha, fearless. ||14|| What has he
begun here? How will this happen? Will this play of his, devoid of fault, be
successful? ||15||  The foot soldiers, seeing the jewel-studded exterior of
Ravana's abode, mistook it for a crocodile-infested lake and were filled with
fear. ||16|| Seeing the immobility of the form, they realized it was a jewel-
studded floor, and then, filled with wonder, they moved forward. ||17||  They
reached the grand entrance of the palace, built with great jewels, resembling
the cave of Mount Meru, shining with jewel-studded arches. ||18||  There, they
saw elephants made of indigo lapis lazuli, resembling the Anjanadri mountain,
with smooth cheeks, large teeth, and extremely bright. ||19||  They also saw
lion cubs, with their tails raised, their mouths fierce with fangs, their eyes
terrifying, and their beautiful manes, standing on the heads of these elephants.
||20||  Seeing these, the foot soldiers, mistaking them for real elephants and
lions, were terrified and fled, reaching the utmost state of bewilderment.
||21||  Then, Angada, knowing their true nature, explained to them, and with
great difficulty, they turned back after a long time. ||22||  The soldiers, with
their eyes darting about, entered Ravana's palace, filled with fear, like a herd
of deer entering a lion's den. ||23||  They crossed many doors, but unable to go
further, they wandered about in the dense palace structure, like the blind born.
||24||  Seeing the walls made of indigo lapis lazuli, they mistook them for
doors, and seeing the buildings studded with crystal gems, they went towards
them, mistaking them for the sky. As a result, they fell from both places, their
heads hitting the stones, and they were filled with great distress, their eyes
closed in pain. ||25-26||  Somehow, they got up and moved forward, but reaching
another chamber, they again collided with the sky-crystal walls. ||27||  Their
foreheads were bruised, and they were in pain from the impact, but they could
not find their way out. ||28||

## Chapter 16 of the Padma Purana  16 Padma Purana  Remembering the Indranila-
made land, they were confused and deceived by their minds, and fell into the
houses on the surface of the earth. ||21||  Then, fearing that the earth might
split open, they sought refuge in another place. Knowing, knowing, they placed
their feet on the Indranila-made lands. ||30||  Seeing the steps made of
crystal, they were ready to go up. They understood that it was the sky, but they
placed their feet differently again. ||31||  Fearing, they went inside, and
again they fell against the walls, and stood there, bewildered by the crystal.
||32||  They saw the peak of the Shanti Bhavan, facing them. But they were
unable to go there, because of the crystal walls. ||33||  "O beautiful one, tell
me the way," said a warrior, in a hurry. He grabbed the hand of a doll, attached
to a pillar. ||34||  He saw a doorkeeper, holding a golden vine. He asked him,
"Tell me the way to the Shanti Bhavan, quickly." ||35||  "How can this arrogant
one not speak?" Thinking this, a warrior slapped him with force, and his fingers
were crushed. ||36||  Knowing that it was artificial, after touching it with his
hand, they went into another chamber, having found the door with difficulty.
||37||  "Is this not a door, but a wall made of great Indranila gems?" They were
filled with doubt, and stretched out their hands first. ||38||  They themselves
were unable to return by the same path they had come. Their minds, filled with
deceitful illusions, decided to go to the Shanti Bhavan. ||39||  Then, seeing a
man, and knowing him to be real by his speech, a warrior grabbed him by the hair
and said harshly, "Go, go, show me the way to the Shanti Bhavan." When he
started to go ahead, they were relieved. ||40-41||  1. This is a Kshatriya. (1)

The Seventy-First Chapter  Reaching the abode of Shantinath, they all arrived,
their hearts filled with joy, offering floral tributes and chanting victory
cries. ||42||  They saw cities adorned with crystal pillars, situated in
beautiful lands, as if suspended in the sky, a sight that filled them with
wonder. ||43||  "Look at this wonder! Look at this wonder! And this is the
greatest wonder!" They exclaimed, showing each other the magnificent treasures
of the temple. ||44||  Angad, having already renounced his chariot, was filled
with awe at the wondrous architecture of the temple. With lotus-like hands
placed on his forehead, he circumambulated the temple, his mouth chanting hymns.
||45||  He had stationed his entire army outside the inner sanctum, surrounded
by his closest companions. His eyes, like blooming lotuses, were capable of
captivating the hearts of even the most beautiful women. ||47||  Gazing at the
silent paintings depicting the life of the Jain sage, he offered his heartfelt
salutations to them, standing before the walls of the main hall. ||48||  With a
calm and joyful heart, he entered the sacred abode of Shantinath. He performed
his obeisance with utmost reverence. ||49||  There, he saw Ravana seated in a
half-lotus posture, facing Shantinath. Ravana, radiating the brilliance of a
thousand Indranila gems, sat before the Lord like Rahu before the Sun. ||50||
He was deeply absorbed in meditation, contemplating knowledge, just as Bharata
had contemplated taking the vows of renunciation. ||51||  Angad addressed
Ravana, "Tell me, Ravana, what is your state of mind now? I will inflict upon
you a fate that even the powerful Yama cannot bring about." ||52||  "What
audacity you have to spread deceit in the presence of the Jina! Shame on you,
wicked one! You have embarked on a futile endeavor." ||53||  With these words,
he struck Ravana with a piece of his upper garment, laughing loudly and
arrogantly. ||54||  He then picked up the flowers placed before Ravana and, with
a harsh voice, hurled them at the women standing below. ||55||

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):  28 In the Padma Purana The fallen
Angada, with cruel and squinting eyes, snatched the lotus flowers from the hands
of the women. He performed the worship of the Jina (Tirthankara) ॥56॥ Then,
returning, he repeatedly incited them with distressing words. The fickle Angada
seized the rosary from his hand and broke it ॥57॥ Scattering it before him, he
again gathered it from all sides. Slowly, he re-strung it and placed it back in
his hand ॥58॥ Pulling his hand, he cut it again and then repeatedly struck it.
He placed it again on the neck and then on the head ॥59॥ Then, he entered the
inner palace, like the middle of a forest of lotus flowers. He engaged in the
sport of the forest-dwelling elephant scorched by the summer heat ॥60॥ Like an
untamed horse released from bondage, he roamed fearlessly, engaged in disturbing
the inner palace ॥61॥ He took the garment of someone and made a rope, binding it
around the neck of a certain woman. Smiling slightly, he loaded some heavy
object on it ॥62॥ With another woman's upper garment, he bound her to a pillar.
When she began to suffer, he quickly released her ॥63॥ The fickle Angada, eager
to play, sold a certain woman with a girdle cord for five dinars to one of his
own men ॥64॥ He put anklets on the ears of another, a girdle in her hair, and a
gem on the feet of someone ॥65॥ Trembling with fear, he bound other women to
each other with their own hair. He placed a chattering peacock on the head of
another ॥66॥ Thus, like a great bull, he greatly disturbed the inner palace of
the lord of the Rakshasas ॥67॥ He said angrily to Ravana, "O wretched Rakshasa!
You had abducted the princess through deception when you were devoid of valor.
Now, I see all your beloved ones. If you can, then make an attempt to retaliate"
॥68॥

The Seventy-First Chapter  Having said this, he leaped forward like a lion, and
seizing the queen, who was most dear to him, and who trembled with fear, her
eyes rolling, and her hair dishevelled, he dragged her along, as the king
Bharata drags the goddess of fortune.  Then he said to Ravana, "O hero! This is
the great queen Mandodari, who is dearer to you than life itself, and who is the
very embodiment of virtue, who is being carried away."  "She will be the
excellent fly-whisk bearer of Sugriva, the king of the Vidyadharas, who dwells
in the assembly hall."  Then she, whose bosom was trembling, and whose garment
was slipping from her breast, kept adjusting it with her restless hands, and her
lower lip was constantly wet with tears, and her whole body was resounding with
the tinkling of her ornaments, she, who was overwhelmed with grief, fell at the
feet of her lord, and then entered his embrace, and said, "O lord! Protect me!
Do you not see my plight? Are you someone else? Are you not the same Dasamukha?
Alas! You have adopted the indifference of the liberated ones, but what will
this indifference avail you in the face of such sorrow?  "Fie upon your valor!
What is the use of your meditation, if you do not cut off the head of this
sinner with your sword?  "You, who could not bear defeat at the hands of men
like the moon and the sun, why do you now tolerate this insult from a mere
mortal?  "But Ravana, with his mind fixed in deep meditation, did not seem to
notice anything. He was sitting in half-lotus posture, his envy had been
banished, his radiance was like that of a mountain of jewels obtained from the
vast caves of Mount Mandara, he was free from all sense-activity, he was devoted
to the worship of knowledge, his body was steady, he was full of fortitude, and
he seemed like a clay image.  "Like Rama, who was meditating on Sita, he was
absorbed in contemplation, and he was as immovable as Mount Mandara."

In the Padma Purana, Then, clearly indicating the ten directions, she
proclaimed, "Victory!" The knowledge, standing before him, spoke to his father.
||5|| She said to the gods and Siddhas, "I am ready to obey your command. O
Lord, give me an order, I can achieve everything in the entire world." ||86||
Leaving aside one who wields a discus and stands against you, I can bring the
entire world under your control, following your wishes. ||7|| O best of men, the
discus-jewel is in your hand. What can others like Rama and Lakshmana achieve?
Do they have the power to capture me? What is it? ||8|| This is the nature of
those like us, we are not capable of defeating a Chakravarti, and what to say of
others? ||86|| Tell me today, shall I destroy all the demons who are displeased
with you, or even the celestial beings? ||10|| I have no respect for those who
are proud of their petty knowledge, those who fly in the sky like grass, I
consider them insignificant. ||11|| Having bowed down to the knowledge that was
being worshipped, whose meditation was complete, who was situated in the midst
of supreme brilliance, and who was the bearer of noble deeds, Dashaanan, as long
as he circumambulates the shrine of peace, Angada, radiant like the sun, leaving
behind Mandodari, whose body was filled with sorrow, flew up into the sky and
went to meet Rama. ||12-13|| Thus ends the seventy-first chapter of the Padma
Purana, known as the Padmayana, narrated by the sage Ravisha, describing the
attainment of the knowledge of the many forms by Ravana. ||71|| 1. The knowledge
stood before him, M. ||

## The 67th Chapter  Then, thousands of women, all together, fell at his feet,
weeping and uttering sweet sounds. They said, "O Lord, the ruler of all the
Vidyadharas, while you are present, the young Angada has come and humiliated us
all." (1) "While you are meditating, the supreme abode of brilliance, even that
lowly Vidyadhara, like a firefly, has been affected by passion." (2) "See our
state, brought about by the wicked Sugriva's son, we are afraid in your
presence." (4) Hearing their words, the ruler of Trikuta, eager to console them,
spoke with his three pure eyes, filled with anger. "He is bound by the noose of
death, surely, for he dares to act thus. O Goddesses, be at peace, your nature
is to be calm." (5-6) "My beloveds, tomorrow, on the battlefield, I will make
Sugriva lifeless, without a head, and I will turn his halo of light into a halo
of darkness." (7) "What anger can there be towards those lowly creatures, Rama
and Lakshmana, like insects on the ground? But I will surely kill all the
Vidyadharas who have gathered on their side." (8) "My beloveds, my enemies are
subject to my mere glance, and now that I have mastered the art of
transformation, why would they not be subdued?" (9) Thus, consoling the women,
Ravana thought, "Now I have defeated my enemies." Then, emerging from the Jain
temple, he engaged in the activities of bathing and other bodily functions. (10)
Then, his bath ceremony took place, filled with the sounds of various musical
instruments, and adorned with various wonderful dances, as beautiful as the god
of love. (11) Many young women, dark as night, immersed in the radiance of the
moon, bathed him with silver pitchers, like full moons. (12)

In the Padma Purana,  Many women, radiant like the evening twilight, bathed him
with reverence, using golden pitchers that shone like the young sun. (13) Others
bathed him with excellent pitchers made of lapis lazuli, as if the goddesses of
fortune themselves were bathing him with lotus petals. (14) Some bathed him with
pitchers red like the morning sun, others with pitchers white like the inside of
a banana tree, and still others with pitchers that attracted swarms of bees with
their fragrance. (15) Before his bath, beautiful women with graceful movements
rubbed him with various fragrant pastes. Then, seated on a magnificent throne
adorned with the brilliance of many gems, he bathed. (16) After bathing, he
adorned himself and, filled with noble emotions, re-entered the temple of
Shantinath. (17) There, with devotion to praise, he performed the highest
worship of the Arhant, offering prostrations with his mind, speech, and body.
Then he entered the dining hall. (18) Having consumed four types of excellent
food, the king went to the playground to test his knowledge. (19) Through the
power of his knowledge, he created many forms and performed various wondrous
deeds that were beyond the reach of other celestial beings. (20) He struck the
earth so hard that it trembled, and the bodies of his enemies on it spun around.
The enemy army, terrified, cried out in fear of death. (21) Then the ministers
said to Ravana, who had finished testing his knowledge, "O King, there is no one
else who can kill Rama now that you have been released." (22) "In the
battlefield, when he is angry and releases his arrows, no one else is capable of
standing before him except you." (23) Ravana, endowed with great powers, created
a vast army through the power of his knowledge. Wearing the jewel-studded
discus, he set out towards the garden of pleasure where Sita resided. (24)
Surrounded by wise and valiant ministers, Ravana appeared like Indra surrounded
by the gods. Or, like the sun, he advanced without hindrance. (25) 1. Nribhih M.

1. Ekasaptatimaṃ parva Seeing the mountain-like Pushpaka vimana (aerial vehicle)
approaching, the Vidyadharis (celestial beings) spoke: "Behold, behold, O
auspicious Sita! The great splendor of Ravana." (26)  The illustrious and mighty
one, descending from the Pushpaka, with limbs adorned with various minerals, is
approaching like a mountain emerging from a cave. (27)  Like an intoxicated
elephant scorched by the sun, with his limbs enveloped by the fire of Cupid, and
with a face resembling the full moon, (28)  He enters the pleasure garden,
covered in floral beauty and accompanied by the humming of bees. Let your gaze
be fixed upon him. (29)  In this lord of Trikuta (the three-peaked mountain),
the form is unparalleled. May your eyes be fulfilled, for this form of his is
indeed supreme. (30)  Then, with her pure vision, she contemplated both his
external and internal strength, which was like a bow shrouded in darkness. (31)
"This immense power, beyond comprehension, is so mighty. Even Rama, the bearer
of Lakshmi, or Lakshmana may face difficulty in conquering him in battle." (32)
"Alas, what if I hear the news of the death of the noble Rama or the handsome
Lakshmana in the war? Or, what if I hear of the death of my wicked brother-in-
law?" (33)  Thus, engulfed in deep contemplation and trembling with fear, Sita
was approached by Ravana. (34)  Ravana said, "O Devi! I have abducted you by
deceit. What is this behavior befitting the descendants of noble lineages?" (35)
"Surely, this is the result of some inevitable karma, or the power of supreme
affection, or the strength of delusion." (36)  "Earlier, in the presence of the
venerable ones, I had taken a vow at the feet of the all-powerful Lord
Anantaveerya that I would not enjoy any woman who does not desire me, be it
Urvashi, Rambha, or any other enchantress." (37-38)  "O most beautiful one in
the world! I have not forcibly enjoyed you, as I have been awaiting your grace."
(39)  "Now, with the arrows sent by my devotees, the support (Rama) has been
severed. O Vaidehi! Mounted on the Pushpaka, roam the world as you wish." (40)

In the Padma Purana, See the peaks of the Agara mountain, the Chaitya Kuta, the
ocean, and the great rivers, and make yourself happy. ||41|| After that, Sita,
whose throat was choked with tears, joined her hands with great difficulty and
spoke to Ravana with a sorrowful voice, ||42|| "O Dasanan! If you have any
affection for me, or if you are pleased with me, then you should be able to
fulfill this request of mine. ||43|| Even if you are angry with Rama when he
comes before you, you should not kill him without delivering my message. ||44||
Tell him, 'O Rama! Your sister, the daughter of the Bhāmaṇḍala, has sent this
message for you: that in the battle against you, due to the power of karma, you
will hear something else. The daughter of the great sage Janaka, Sita,
overwhelmed by the weight of great sorrow, has become like the flame of a lamp
struck by the wind, and has been reduced to a deplorable state. O Lord! I have
not given up my life until now, only because of my longing for your arrival.'
||45-47|| Having said this, she fainted and fell to the ground with her eyes
closed, like a golden Kalpa tree broken by a maddened elephant. ||48|| Seeing
Sita in such a state, Ravana, whose heart was tender, became extremely sorrowful
and began to think: "Alas! This affection of theirs is an unquenchable
affection, caused by the bonds of karma. It seems that they will never be
released from this worldly pit." ||49-50|| "I curse myself again and again! What
a despicable act I have done! I have separated this couple who were united in
love. ||51|| I am a great sinner! Without any purpose, I have acquired the dirt
of disgrace from the righteous, like an ordinary man. ||52|| I, a wicked man,
have defiled the pure and vast lineage like a lotus. Alas! How did I commit this
act? ||53|| Curse this woman who instantly kills great men, who is like a
Kimpaka fruit, and who is the source of suffering for the earth. ||54|| A woman
in general, 1. Sita. 2. Unquenchable affection. 3. Burning.

The Seventy-First Chapter  This river-like crooked, terrible, Dharma-Artha-
destroying, and the mine of all inauspiciousness, should be abandoned by the
virtuous with effort. ||56||  She who was like nectar, who seemed to nourish me
with her beauty, and who was more beloved than all the goddesses, is now, with
her heart attached to another, like a pot filled with poison, causing me great
distress. ||57-58||  She who, even though she did not desire me, used to make my
mind restless, she who was the object of my constant thoughts, is now like
withered grass, deserving of no respect. ||59||  Even if this Sita, whose heart
is attached to another man, desires me now, what pleasure can I derive from her,
devoid of true affection? ||60||  At the time when my wise brother Vibhishana
was favorable to me and gave me good advice, this wicked mind did not attain
peace. ||61||  Rather, it became subject to delusion due to his advice, which is
natural, for the minds of virtuous men are often under control. ||62||  After
considering this, Ravana thought, "Yesterday, I had a council with my ministers
regarding the war. Now, what is the point of discussing friendship with those
who are condemned by the heroes?" ||63||  To fight and to show compassion are
two contradictory things. Alas! I, like an ordinary man, have fallen into this
great predicament. ||64||  If I surrender Sita to Rama out of compassion now,
the world will consider me weak, for it is difficult to understand the minds of
all. ||65||  He who is free to do whatever he wants, lives happily, being cruel.
A man like me, whose heart is soft with compassion, lives in sorrow. ||66||  If
I defeat Rama and Lakshmana, who are skilled in the arts of the lion and the
Garuda, in battle, capture them alive, and then, with all my wealth, return Sita
to Rama, I will not be guilty of any sin. ||67-68||  And the great public
censure arising from fear and injustice...

Padma Purana 1 Having resolved in his mind, the great and powerful Ravana, who
was like an elephant, entered the lotus forest, which was like the inner
apartments. || 70 || Then, remembering the great insult he had suffered at the
hands of his enemies, Ravana's eyes blazed with anger, and he became as
terrifying as Yama himself. || 71 || With trembling lips, the ten-headed Ravana
spoke words that caused a terrible fever to spread among the women. || 72 || He
said, "In battle, I will seize that wicked and invincible Angada, along with the
sinner, and cleave him in two with my sword that shines with rays of light. ||
73 || I will capture that dark sphere and bind him tightly, then crush his life
with blows from my iron mace. || 74 || And I will bind the wicked Hanuman in a
wooden clamp, and tear him apart with my razor-sharp karont. || 75 || Except for
Rama, I will destroy all the other wicked and evil enemies who have transgressed
the limits of propriety, crushing them with a shower of weapons in battle. || 76
|| Gautama Swami says, "O King of Magadha! When Ravana was making this
resolution, the following words were being uttered by the seers of omens, that
is, they were discussing these things among themselves. || 77 || "Look, these
hundreds of kinds of calamities are happening. There is a very harsh, weapon-
like circle around the sun. || 78 || The moon is hiding somewhere, as if in
fear, throughout the whole night. There are terrible thunderbolts falling, and a
great earthquake is shaking the earth. || 79 || A red meteor, like blood, fell
in the east, and jackals were howling mournfully in the north. || 80 || Horses
are neighing with trembling necks and loud voices, and elephants are striking
the earth with their trunks, making a harsh sound. || 81 || The images of the
gods have become like days of sorrow, weeping tears. Great trees are falling
without any apparent cause. || 82 || Crows are facing the sun, making a harsh
sound, and they have abandoned their flocks, sitting alone, their wings

The Seventy-First Chapter  Death is often foretold by these omens, for such
changes do not occur in other ways. Even Indra, when his merit is depleted,
falls from his position. In truth, the people are subject to their karma, and
heroism is a quality, not a primary factor. What is destined to be obtained will
be obtained; one cannot escape it. There is no heroism for beings in the
presence of fate; they must suffer the consequences of their actions.  Behold,
this Ravana, skilled in all the sciences of statecraft, knowledgeable in the
principles of democracy, a scholar of Jain grammar, and adorned with great
virtues, is nevertheless, due to his own actions, trapped in a cycle of
suffering, his mind clouded, and he has strayed from the right path.  There is
no greater sorrow in the world than death, yet see, Ravana, filled with
excessive pride, does not even contemplate it. Though devoid of the power of the
stars and afflicted by crooked, evil planets, this foolish one still desires to
go to the battlefield.  Fearful of the destruction of his power, filled with the
sentiment of a single warrior, though he has studied the scriptures, he does not
discern what is right and wrong.  Therefore, O King Shrenik, I will tell you
what was in the mind of this arrogant Ravana. Listen to the truth.  Ravana
thought, "Having conquered all people, and freed my sons and brothers, I will
return to Lanka and continue to do all this. I will drive out all the lowly
earth-dwellers from this earth and establish the praiseworthy celestial beings
in their place."  **The Lineage of the Descendants**  In this lineage, the
Tirthankaras, the lords of the three worlds, praised by the gods, the
Chakravartins, the Balabhadra, the Narayana, and we, will be born.

## The Thirty-Seventh Chapter  Then, on another day, the supremely radiant
Ravana, adorned with a brilliant aura, stood in the assembly hall as the sun
rose. [1]  He was served by Kubera, Varuna, Ishana, Yama, and Soma, along with
many other kings, making him appear as resplendent as Indra himself. [2]
Surrounded by valiant men born of noble lineage, seated on his throne, Ravana
shone with a brilliance like the moon surrounded by stars. [3]  He was fragrant
with divine perfumes, his garments, garlands, and unguents were all celestial.
His chest was adorned with necklaces, he was handsome and had a gentle gaze. [4]
With a generous heart, he looked around the assembly and thought, "The valiant
Meghavahana is not present in his place." [5]  Nor was Indrajeet, who shone like
Indra himself and was beloved for his captivating eyes, nor was Bhanukarna
(Kumbhakarna), who radiated like the sun. [6]  Though this assembly, like a
lake, is adorned with lotus-like men, it lacks the brilliance of those great
men, and therefore does not possess its full splendor. [7]  Though Ravana's eyes
were like blooming lotuses and he himself was exceptionally beautiful, his face
was marred by the anguish of worry, making him difficult to look at. [8]  His
forehead, like a courtyard, was shrouded in darkness caused by the knot of his
furrowed brows. He was as terrifying as Yama, radiating the fierce glow of an
angry serpent. [9]  Seeing Ravana with his lips tightly clenched, immersed in
his own thoughts, the ministers were deeply frightened and unsure of what to do.
[10]  Their minds were filled with anxiety, wondering, "Is he angry with me or
with him?" They all stood with folded hands, their heads bowed to the ground.
[11]  May, Ugra, Shuka, Lokaksha, and Saran, along with other ministers, were
ashamed and looked down at the ground, their faces filled with sorrow. [12]

## Padma Purana  **Chapter 13:**  The king's soldiers, with their earrings
swaying, were shouting, "O God, be pleased! Be pleased!" with great urgency.
**Chapter 14:**  The women, residing in palaces with walls shining like Kailasa
peaks, were terrified and looking at him.  **Chapter 15:**  Mandodari, with her
eyes filled with fear and her mind disturbed, saw him through the windows made
of jewels.  **Chapter 16-17:**  With his red eyes, the powerful Ravana rose and
was about to enter his shining armory, filled with invincible weapons made of
jewels. He was as eager to enter the armory as Indra is to enter his celestial
abode. As he was about to enter, several inauspicious omens appeared.  **Chapter
18:**  A sneeze came from behind, a great serpent crossed his path, and it
seemed as if people were saying, "Ha, hi, this is a curse! Where are you going?"
**Chapter 19:**  His umbrella, adorned with a sapphire rod, was broken by the
wind. His upper garment fell down, and a crow cawed on his right side.
**Chapter 20:**  Other inauspicious omens also dissuaded him from going to war.
In reality, none of them, neither by words, actions, nor thoughts, approved of
his going to war.  **Chapter 21:**  Seeing these ominous signs, those who were
skilled in the knowledge of various omens became extremely anxious.  **Chapter
22:**  Mandodari, gathering the wise ministers like Shuka, said, "Why don't you
speak to the king about his welfare?"  **Chapter 23:**  "Knowing both your own
and others' actions, what are you doing now? Kumbhakarna and others are
powerless and have been imprisoned for many days.  **Chapter 24:**  "These
heroes, whose brilliance is like that of the guardians of the world, and who
have performed many wonders, are now captured by the enemy. What are you doing
to restore their strength?"  **Notes:**  * **Sneezing:** According to the Shakun
Shastra (Omen Science), sneezing in different directions has different meanings.
Sneezing in the east signifies death, in the southeast signifies grief, in the
south signifies loss, in the southwest signifies auspiciousness, in the west
signifies sweet food, in the northwest signifies wealth, in the north signifies
conflict, in the northeast signifies gain of wealth, in the sky signifies
destruction of all, and in the underworld signifies attainment of all wealth.
Ravana sneezed, signifying death.

The seventy-third chapter.  After paying obeisance to the Devi, the chief
ministers said, "O Devi! The rule of Dasanan is like the rule of Yama, he is
very proud and considers himself the supreme." ||25|| "O Lord! In the whole
world, there is no man whose words, which are for the ultimate benefit of
others, are accepted by him." ||26|| "Whatever is going to happen to the minds
of those who follow their karma, even Indra and the group of gods cannot change
it." ||27|| "Even though Trikutaindra knows the essence of all the scriptures
and the ultimate knowledge, he is still bound by delusion." ||28|| "We have
explained it to him in many ways, there is no way left in which we have not
explained it to him, yet his mind is not turning away from the desired object -
Sita." ||29|| "It is difficult to stop a great river in the rainy season when
the flow of water is overflowing, or a man who is driven by karma." ||30|| "O
Lord! Even though we have said everything, what is the fault in it? Perhaps your
words may bring him to his senses. It is not right to ignore him." ||31||
"Hearing the words of the ministers, Mandodari, who had decided to go to Ravana,
who was trembling with fear and seemed like a frightened Lakshmi, who was
covered in a clean, long, variegated garment that resembled water, was ready to
go to Ravana." ||32-33|| "Like Rati, who was ready to go to her husband,
Kamadeva, all the members of the family turned their attention towards
Mandodari, who was going to Ravana." ||34|| "Mandodari, who was surrounded by
women holding umbrellas and whisks, seemed like Shachi going to Indra - the
queen of Indra." ||35|| "Mandodari, who was breathing heavily, who was stumbling
while walking, whose girdle was slightly loose, who was always eager to serve
her husband, and who was like a great river of love, was seen by Ravana with
playful eyes. At that time, Ravana was respectfully touching his armor and the
group of his main weapons." ||36-37|| "Ravana said, "O beautiful one! O you who
walk with a gait as graceful as a swan..." ||38||

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):  Beloved! O Devi! What is the
urgent purpose of your coming here in such haste? [38] O Bhāminī! Why is your
arrival, like the sudden appearance in a dream, snatching away the heart of the
ten-faced one (Rāvaṇa)? [36]  Thereafter, she whose face was like the spotless
full moon, whose eyes were like blossomed lotuses, who was naturally endowed
with the best of graces, who was skilled in the art of casting sidelong glances,
whose body was the abode of the god of love, whose sweet voice was occasionally
faltering, whose body was adorned with the variegated splendor of her teeth and
lips, whose belly was bent down by the weight of her large golden breasts, whose
triple folds of skin were extremely delicate and most beautiful, and who was the
supreme ground for the grace of her lord - that Mandodarī, prostrating, said:
[40-43]  O Deva! Being filled with supreme love and compassion, please grant me
the alms of my husband. Attain graciousness. [44] O great king! O you who are
the great waves of determination! Lift me up, who is drowning in the ocean of
sorrow of separation. [45] O highly intelligent one! You are like the sun in the
sky of your kinsmen. Therefore, do not completely neglect this vast garden of
your family. [46] O master, please listen even to these harsh words of mine.
Since this position has been given to me by you, you should forgive my offense.
[47] Words that are unpleasant, but beneficial to friends, should be accepted
like medicine, as they are free from opposition and bring happiness in the end.
[48] Why have you ascended the scales of doubt? Why do you, without any
restraint, torment both yourself and us? [49] Even now, is that same ancient
land not yours? O Deva! Only restrain the mind that has set out on the wrong
path. [50] This desire of yours has arisen in your extreme distress. Quickly
control the horses of the senses, firmly holding the reins of discrimination.
[51]

## The 67th Chapter  Having known your excellent fortitude, depth, and wisdom,
it seems that you are being led astray by someone, just like Sita went astray.
||52||  Seeing your reflection in the well of misfortune, like the spider seeing
its reflection in the water, why are you drawn to these calamities? ||53||
Break through the towering tree of infamy, which brings immense suffering. What
fruit do you desire, like the hollow stem of a banana tree? ||54||  O, you who
are as deep as the ocean, adorn your noble lineage once more. Quickly abandon
Sita, who is like a thorn in the head of your noble family. ||55||  O Lord,
warriors engage in conflict for the sake of wealth or with the thought, "Either
I kill him or I die." But here, wealth is not the purpose of your conflict, for
you have no lack of it. And the other purpose, death, is for what? To die for a
woman who is not yours? This is laughable. ||56||  Or, let's say that defeating
the enemy group is the purpose of the conflict. What purpose is achieved by
defeating the enemy group? Therefore, O Lord, abandon this stubborn attachment
to Sita. ||57||  And let the other vow remain, the vow of renouncing another
woman. Only by renouncing another woman does a man of good character attain
praise in both births. ||58||  A man who lusts after other women, who are like
kohl, even though he is as heavy as Mount Meru, becomes as light as a blade of
grass. ||59||  Even a king, or even a son of a king, who is favored by the gods,
becomes stained by the mud of attachment to another woman and attains ultimate
infamy. ||60||  He who engages in love with another woman, like a fool, is like
one who enjoys the company of a venomous serpent. ||61||  Do not defile your
pure lineage with infamy. Or, you are defiling yourself. Therefore, abandon this
evil thought. ||62||  The mighty men like Samuka and Vajraghoṣa, driven by their
desire for another woman, have met their destruction. Have you not heard of
them? ||63||

44 Padma Purana Oh beloved, why have you become so fearful? Fearful, you are
indeed a fearful woman, the name is synonymous with your nature. ||65|| You are
not the sun, nor are you the thunder of Saturn, nor are you any other man, why
do you speak like this? ||66|| I am the fire of death, the destroyer of the
enemy's army, I will not return Sita, do not fear, oh slow-witted one. ||67||
What is the purpose of this discussion for you? You are appointed to protect
Sita, if you are not capable of protecting her, then return her to me quickly.
||68|| Hearing this, Mandodari said, "You desire pleasure with her, that is why
you are shameless and say such things, give her to me." ||69|| Saying this, the
long-eyed Mandodari, filled with jealousy, struck Ravana with a lotus flower,
desiring his good fortune. ||70|| Restraining herself, she said, "Oh beautiful
one, tell me, what great virtue have you seen in her that you desire her so
much?" ||71|| She is not known to be virtuous, nor is she beautiful in form, nor
is she skilled in the arts, nor does she follow your heart. ||72|| Even with
such a Sita, oh beloved, what is your wisdom in desiring her? In my eyes, you
are only revealing your own insignificance, which you do not understand. ||73||
No man can achieve greatness by praising himself, only those qualities that are
praised by others become truly virtuous. ||74|| Therefore, I do not say
anything, but you know yourself, what to speak of poor Sita, even Lakshmi is not
equal to me. ||75|| Therefore, oh lord, abandon this excessive desire for Sita,
do not fall into this exceptional fire, which is unavoidable. ||76|| You are
disrespecting me by desiring this earth-bound woman, it seems as if a foolish
child is discarding a ruby for a piece of glass. ||77|| The dark-complexioned,
lotus-eyed Ravana said to Mandodari, "Why have you become so fearful? Fearful,
you are indeed a fearful woman, the name is synonymous with your nature. ||65||
I am not the sun, nor am I the thunder of Saturn, nor am I any other man, why do
you speak like this? ||66|| I am the fire of death, the destroyer of the enemy's

## The 73rd Chapter  **78.**  This form of yours is not divine, it does not
arise in my mind. How can you desire this village woman, O Lord?  **79.**  I am
extremely skilled in assuming forms according to your desire, so command me, how
should I become? O Lord, shall I become Lakshmi, who quickly takes delight in
your lotus-like abode and steals your heart? Or, O Lord, shall I become Sachi,
the resting place of Indra's eyes?  **80.**  Or shall I become Rati herself, who
binds the mind of Kamadeva? Or, O Lord, shall I become one who acts according to
your will?  **1.**  Then, with his head lowered and eyes half-open, Ravana,
filled with shame, spoke softly, "My dear, you are right to call me a
womanizer."  **2.**  "Look what I have done! By being attached to another woman,
I have brought upon myself the greatest infamy and made this foolish soul
utterly insignificant."  **3.**  "May this heart, which is attached to the flesh
of worldly pleasures, a vessel of sin, and fickle, be cursed! O heart, your
actions are utterly base!"  **4.**  Saying this, Dashaanan, whose moon-like
smile spread upwards and whose lotus-like eyes were blooming, spoke again to
Mandodari:  **85.**  "O Devi, even though you are not in a form created by
magic, but in your natural state, you are most dear to me. What need do I have
of other women, O best one?"  **86.**  Having received the favor of her Lord,
Mandodari, whose heart was filled with joy, spoke again, "O Lord, is it
appropriate to show a lamp to the sun? In the same way, it is futile for me to
make any request of you."  **87.**  "O Dashaanan, I have spoken this beneficial
word among my friends, so ask other wise men as well. I am powerless and do not
understand."  **88.**  "Even if someone who knows all the scriptures, O Lord, is
negligent due to fate, should a creature who desires his well-being try to
enlighten him?"  **10.**  Just as Vishnu Kumar Muni had forgotten his soul due
to his actions, was he not awakened by the songs of the principles?  **77.**
Chhoḍakar desires a glass.  **1.**  Chanchala, M.

The Puranas This distinction of "this is a man and this is a woman" is made by
the foolish. The wise, on the other hand, seek good words from all, both men and
women. ||11|| If you have even a little bit of affection for me, then I say,
give up your desire for another woman, or abandon the path of a man who is
enamored with another woman. ||12|| If you permit me, I will take Janaki and
bring her to Rama, and I will bring back your sons Indrajit and Meghavahana, and
your brother Kumbhakarna. What is the purpose of killing so many people?
||63-64|| Thus spoken to, Ravana, the king of the Rakshasas, became very angry
and said, "Go, go, messenger, go where I cannot see your face." ||65|| Oh, you
think yourself very wise, abandoning your own progress and engaging in the lowly
act of praising the enemy. ||66|| You are the mother of heroes and my queen, yet
you speak such lowly words. It seems there is no other cowardly woman greater
than you. ||67|| Thus spoken to, the queen said, "Listen to what the wise have
said about the birth of the Balabhadra, Narayana, and Prati-Narayana." ||98||
Oh, Lord, in this age, there have already been seven Balabhadra, namely Vijay,
Achal, Bhadra, Suprabha, Sudarshana, Ananda, and Nandana, and seven Narayana,
namely Triprutha, Dwiprutha, Swayambhu, Purushottama, Narasimha, Pundarika, and
Datta. All these were very valiant and famous men in the world. At this time,
there are two Balabhadra, namely Padma and Lakshmana, and two Narayana. Oh,
Dashaanan, it seems that both of them have arrived here. Just as Ashvagriva,
Taraka, and other Prati-Narayana were destroyed by them, so it seems that you
also wish to be destroyed by them. ||102|| The teacher did not enlighten him
through instruction. ||60|| 1. Vinaya, etc. Nine Balabhadra - 1 Vijay 2 Achal 3
Bhadra 4 Suprabha 5 Sudarshana 6 Ananda 7 Nandana, 8 Padmaram and 9 Balarama. -
Nine Narayana - 1 Triprutha 2 Dwiprutha 3 Swayambhu, 4 Purushottama 5 Narasimha
6 Pundarika 7 Datta 8 Lakshmana and Krishna. Nine Prati-Narayana - 1 Ashvagriva
2 Taraka 3 Meruk 4 Dwishambhu 5 Madhu 6 Bali 7 Prahalad 8 Ravana and Jarasandha.

## The 37th Chapter  **O Lord!**  I am apprehensive about explaining the truth,
as long as the complete certainty of the subject to be explained is not
apparent.    **103.**  A wise person should perform actions that bring happiness
in this world and the next, and not those that are the cause of the sprouting of
the seed of suffering and the source of blame.  **104.**  O Ravana, blinded by
sin!  If there is a person in the three worlds who has attained satisfaction
from enjoying pleasures for a long time, then praise him.  **105.**  Even if you
cannot become a monk after enjoying all pleasures, at least be devoted to the
duties of a householder and destroy suffering.  **106.**  O Lord!  Your body is
radiant with the sword of **Anuvrata**, adorned with the umbrella of **Niyama**,
clad in the armor of **Samyak Darshan**, and marked by the flag of **Sheel**.
Your body is fragrant with the sandalwood of **Bhavana**, your bow is **Samyak
Gyan**, you are strong with the power of **Vashendriya**, and you are powerful
with the might of **Shubh Dhyan**.  You are equipped with the bridle of
**Maryada**, riding on the elephant of **Nischya**, and your great power is
**Jin Bhakti**.  Conquer the army of **Durgati**.  Indeed, this army of
**Durgati** is very crooked, sinful, and extremely difficult to bear.  By
conquering it, you will become happy.  **107-110.**  Wander through Jambudvipa,
worshipping the natural **Jinalayas** on the mountains like Himavat and Mandara,
along with me.  **111.**  Play in the groves of Mandaragiri and on the banks of
the Ganga, adorned with the leaves of the hands of eighteen thousand women.
**112.**  O Beautiful!  The **Vidhyadhar** couples roam freely in their desired,
beautiful places, enjoying themselves.  **113.**  O Learned!  O Glorious!  There
is no purpose in fighting.  Be pleased and accept my words, which will bring
happiness in every way.  **114.**  Abandon this slander, which is like poison,
blameworthy, and the cause of ultimate misfortune.  Why are you drowning in the
ocean of disgrace?  **115.**  Thus, Mandoadari, with folded hands, fell at the
feet of Ravana, seeking his ultimate welfare.  **116.**

In the Padma Purana,  Ravana, fearless and without fear, said to the frightened
Mandodari, "Why are you filled with fear without any reason?" ||117|| "Oh
beautiful one! There is no man greater than me. Why are you clinging to this
false fear because of your womanhood?" ||118|| "You said that you were informing
me of the rise of another side. But, oh Devi, let me tell you clearly, there are
many men who bear the name Narayana and Baldeva. Does the mere attainment of a
name bring about the fulfillment of a task?" ||119-120|| "Oh fearful one! If
someone, be it a beast or a man, is given the name Siddha, does he attain the
happiness of Siddhahood merely by the name?" ||121|| "Just as I made Indra, the
lord of the city of Rathnapur, attain the state of Anindra, you see how I have
made this Narayana into Anarayan." ||122|| Thus, boasting of his strength, the
mighty Ravana, whose body was covered in a sheet of his own brilliance, and
whose actions were dependent on Yama, entered the pleasure house with Mandodari,
just as Indra enters with Lakshmi. ||123-124|| Then, as the time of evening
arrived, the sun, whose disc was setting due to the twilight, contracted its
rays, just as a sage contracts his passions. ||125|| The sun, red with the
twilight, seemed to be scolding the day, as if it were being bitten by the lips
of the twilight, and then disappeared somewhere. ||126|| The lotuses, with their
folded petals, seemed to be offering their lotus-like hands, while the cries of
the swans mourned the setting sun. ||127|| As the sun set, the army of planets
and stars arrived on the same path, as if the moon had released them to roam
freely, giving them permission. ||128|| Then, as the evening, illuminated by the
jewels of the lamps, appeared, Lanka, shining with its brilliance, resembled the
peak of Mount Meru. ||129||

Trisaptati Parva 48  1. A certain beloved woman embraced her lover and said, "I
shall enjoy this one night with you, come what may tomorrow." (130)  2. A
certain woman, intoxicated with the fragrance of the garland of jasmine flowers
on her head and drunk with passion, rolled on the lap of her lover like a shower
of delicate flowers. (131)   3. A certain full-bosomed woman, with graceful
steps like a lotus, went to her beloved, the embodiment of beauty. (132)  4. A
certain beautiful woman, by her very nature, adorned herself with ornaments,
creating a charming effect with the gold and gems. (133)  5. Pairs of
Vidyadharas played as they desired, shining alike in every abode, as if they
were in pleasure grounds. (134)  6. Then, as if speaking, Lanka resounded with
the melodious songs, the sounds of the veena and vamsha, on the arrival of the
night. (135)  7. Others, possessed by their beloveds, enjoyed drinking the
intoxicating liquor along with the fragrance of tambula, garlands and other
divine pleasures. (136)  8. A certain woman, seeing her face reflected in the
cup, struck the lord of the blue lotus in a state of intoxication. (137)  9. The
fragrance of the women's faces left in the liquor, and the passion of the women
was created by that liquor. (138)  10. That very thing attained the highest
beauty by association with the beloved ones, for the remnant of the liquor drunk
by the beloved became sweet. (139)  11. A certain woman, taking the beauty of
her eyes to be a blue lotus, smiled at her lover for a long time. (140)  12. A
certain young woman, though not mature, was gradually made to drink liquor until
she attained the state suitable for the god of love. (141)  13. Putting aside
the friend who was shy, the friend who was the liquor made the utmost desired
sport with the lovers. (142)  14. The unsteady glances, the repeatedly slurred
speech, the immodest behavior of the women became charming to the men. (143)

Padmapurane The married couple, desiring honey, were drinking the yellow liquid
from each other's cups. They were making loud sounds, imitating the movements of
the cuckoo bird. [144]  The handsome one, after embracing his beloved, drank the
intoxicating liquid from the cup, his eyes blossoming. [145]   There was a
slight trembling of the lips of those who were like the buds, having their
natural redness washed away by the liquor. Their lips had an extraordinary
charm. [146]  The honey in the cup, blended with the hues of the white, red and
blue lotuses, appeared like a lake. [147]  The shameless women were revealing
their secret regions and speaking words that should not be uttered. [148]  Cupid
had ascended on the foundation of the moon, youth and liquor, and had made those
women extremely shameless. [149]  The lovemaking, marked with scratches, sighs
and the grasping of lips, seemed to be the auspicious rite preceding the
upcoming battle. [150]  This Ravana, too, with his charming behavior, had
brought the entire harem under his control. [151]  Mandodari, the large-eyed
one, again and again embraced her lord and looked at his face, but could not be
satisfied. [152]  She said, "O beloved, when you return victorious from there, I
shall always embrace you. [153] O enchanting one, I shall not leave you even for
a moment, but will cling to your entire body like a creeper." [154]  While
Mandodari, her heart afflicted with love, was speaking thus, the rooster crowed
and the night came to an end. [155]  Then, with the disappearance of the stars'
brilliance and the arrival of the reddish dawn, the sound of singing was heard
in every house. [156]

The 37th Chapter  The sun, the eye of the world, covered the directions with its
rays, resembling a circle of fire, and reached its connection with the rising
point. ||15||  In the morning, the ladies were distressed, filled with sorrow,
and their beloved husbands were trying to console them. They were overwhelmed
with unbearable grief. ||15||  The deep-sounding drums, preceded by the sound of
conch shells, were beaten by the order of Ravana, skilled in giving the signal
for war. ||15||  The warriors, filled with pride and arrogance, went out,
mounted on horses, elephants, and chariots, rejoicing. ||16||  They were adorned
with shining weapons like swords, bows, clubs, and spears, and their bodies were
decorated with waving chowries and umbrellas. ||161||  The Vidhyadhara kings,
swift, like gods, powerful, and skilled in warfare, went out in great splendor.
||162||  Seeing the plight of the women, whose eyes were red like lotuses from
constant weeping, even the hearts of the wicked were filled with sorrow. ||163||
One warrior, leaving his beloved behind, said, "My dear, go back, I am truly
going to war." ||164||  One woman, with eyes like a deer, wanted to see her
husband's face, so she said, "Take your turban, dear," as an excuse. ||165||
When her beloved was out of sight, another woman fainted and fell to the ground,
surrounded by her friends, with tears streaming down her face. ||166||  One
woman, returning, held onto the edge of the bed, silent and motionless, like a
clay doll. ||167||  One warrior, blessed with perfect vision and a follower of
the Anuvratas, was watched by his wife from behind and by a celestial maiden
from the front. ||168||  The warriors, who were previously as gentle as the full
moon, became fierce and radiant like Yama, when they entered the battlefield,
adorned with armor. ||166||  Maricha, with his army of chariots, elephants,
horses, and infantry, equipped with bows and umbrellas, arrived at the city with
great speed. ||170||  The archer, Vimala Chandra, Vimala Ambuda, Sunanda,
Ananda, Nanda, and others, numbering hundreds and thousands, were also there.
||171||  And in the temples of the Arhat Bhagwan, the sweet sound of music began
to resonate. ||156||  The sun, resembling a mass of fire at the time of
destruction, covered the directions with its rays and reached its connection
with the rising point. ||157||  In the morning, the ladies were distressed,
filled with sorrow, and their beloved husbands were trying to console them. They
were overwhelmed with unbearable grief. ||158||  Then, by the order of Ravana,
the conch shells were blown, signaling the war, and the deep-sounding drums were

52 Padma Purana With divine chariots created by knowledge, shining with great
brilliance, they shone, like Agni Kumaras, illuminating the ten directions.
||172|| Some, with weapons blazing, covered the directions with elephants like
the Himalayas, as if with clouds filled with lightning. ||173|| Some, with a
multitude of swift horses, bearing weapons of ten kinds, seemed to shatter the
circle of stars with their speed. ||174|| With large, diverse musical
instruments, the neighing of horses, the roaring of elephants, the shouts of
foot soldiers, the lion roars of warriors, the victory cries of bards, the songs
of entertainers, and the inspiring sounds of the skilled, ||175-176|| all these
great sounds, united from all sides, made the sky resound, as if filled with the
clouds of the end of the world. ||177|| The king's army, filled with horses,
chariots, and foot soldiers, shining with the brilliance of their mutual
excellence, with large arms, chests adorned with high armor, and lightning-like
radiance, advanced towards victory. ||178|| The foot soldiers, with their swords
flashing, went ahead, eager to please their lord. With their diverse groups,
they filled the sky and the directions without a gap. ||179|| Thus, with the
accumulated karma of the three worlds, both auspicious and inauspicious, still
present, this being, though he performs many actions, is not able to do
otherwise, even the sun cannot make him do otherwise. ||180|| Thus ends the
seventy-third chapter of the Padma Purana, named Udyoga, narrated by the sage
Ravishena. ||73|| 1. Yuta M.

The seventy-fourth chapter, with due respect and joy, is narrated as follows.
The lord of the three peaks, Ravana, asked his beloved Mandodari, "Oh beloved,
beautiful one, who knows if we will see each other again in this great and
fearful war?"   The beloved replied, "Oh lord, may you always prosper and
conquer your enemies. We will all see you return victorious from the war."
Thus addressed, Ravana, whose eyes were gazed upon by thousands of women, and
whose radiance was immense, went out of the city.   As he went out, he saw a
magnificent chariot named Indra, created by the art of illusion, shining like
the sun in autumn.   The chariot was yoked to a thousand elephants, whose bodies
were as dark as rain clouds, and whose radiance was like a halo. It seemed as if
the chariot was aiming to conquer Mount Meru itself.   The elephants were
intoxicated with madness, their cheeks dripping with saliva, their four white
and yellow tusks standing erect, adorned with conch shells and fly whisks, their
necks adorned with pearl garlands, their large bells ringing, resembling the
divine elephant Airavata, and adorned with the colors of various metals. They
were invincible, the very embodiment of humility, roaring like thunder,
resembling a mass of dark clouds, and moving with a beautiful grace.   Ravana,
whose arm was adorned with a beautiful bracelet, and whose radiance was like
that of Indra, mounted the chariot created by illusion.   With his large eyes
and unparalleled form, Ravana mounted the chariot, as if he were about to devour
the entire world with his power.   Surrounded by ten thousand celestial kings,
who were his equals, who served his interests, who were immensely powerful, who
shone like the gods, and who understood his intentions, Ravana, the lord of the
celestial city, prepared to face Sugriva and Ravana.

54 Seeing in the Padma Purana, to the south, extremely fearsome, ominous-making,
Mallas, like vultures in the sky, roam, obscuring the sun. ||14|| Knowing the
signs, they speak of great destruction. Fierce in their valor, enraged, they
went forth like a great fire. ||15|| Pamabha, standing among his army, asked in
astonishment, "O, noble ones, what is the name of this city, blazing with
brilliance?" ||16|| Adorned with very large, Jambunada-made peaks, What is the
name of this mountain, with the shade of a thundercloud? ||17|| Asked by him,
Suṣeṇa and others, overcome by confusion, Could not speak immediately, and he
asked them again. ||18|| "Tell me, what is the name of this mountain, seen
here?" Agad, Jambavan, and others, trembled and spoke softly. ||19|| "This is
the chariot of Padma-naabha, with many forms, Created by his knowledge, skilled
in causing death-fever." ||20|| "The one who was angered by the son of the king
of Kishkindha, That Ravana, bearing great illusionary power, sits here." ||21||
Hearing their words, Lakshmana spoke to the charioteer, "Bring the chariot
quickly," he said, and he did so. ||22|| Then, the fierce, fearsome, assembled,
Their sound mixed with the sound of millions of conch shells, along with other
instruments. ||23|| Hearing that sound, the delighted warriors, with fierce
gestures, Armed, with quivers on their shoulders, stood near Lakshmana. ||24||
"Do not fear, beloved, stay here, return, abandon sorrow, I will conquer the
lord of Lanka and return to you today." ||25|| Thus, the proud warriors,
comforting their excellent wives, Prepared within the palace, and went out as
they should. ||26|| Driven by the urge of mutual competition, The warriors
mounted their chariots, etc., their eyes flickering towards their weapons.
||27|| The chariot, joined with a great elephant, with a deep, resonant sound,
The lord of the sky, Bhutasvana, mounted, shone. ||28|| Seeing the celestial
sphere, enraged, he went towards them. In the south of Ravana, bears were making
extremely fearsome sounds, and vultures were circling in the sky, obscuring the
sun. ||12, 14|| The great warriors, filled with the pride of valor, though they
knew these were bad omens, signifying death, were enraged and continued to
advance. ||15|| Standing in the midst of his army, Rama, astonished, asked the
soldiers, "O, noble men! What is the name of this city, blazing with brilliance,
adorned with large, golden peaks, and bearing the radiance of a thundercloud?"
||16, 17|| Supeṇa and the other celestial beings were themselves confused, so
they were not able to answer Rama immediately. Still, Rama kept asking them,
"Tell me, what is the name of this mountain seen here?" Then, trembling with
fear, Jambavan and others spoke softly, "O Rama! This is the chariot of Padma-
naabha, with many forms, created by his knowledge, skilled in causing death-
fever." ||18-20|| "The one who was angered by the son of the king of Kishkindha,
that Ravana, bearing great illusionary power, sits here." ||21|| Hearing their
words, Lakshmana said to the charioteer, "Bring the chariot quickly." Hearing
this, the charioteer obeyed, bringing the chariot and presenting it. ||22||
Then, the fierce, fearsome, assembled, their sound mixed with the sound of
millions of conch shells, along with other instruments. ||23|| Hearing that
sound, the delighted warriors, with fierce gestures, armed, with quivers on

return, abandon sorrow, I will conquer the lord of Lanka and return to you
today." Thus, the proud warriors, comforting their excellent wives, prepared
within the palace, and went out as they should. ||25-26|| Driven by the urge of
mutual competition, the warriors mounted their chariots, etc., their eyes
flickering towards their weapons. ||27|| The chariot, joined with a great
elephant, with a deep, resonant sound, the lord of the sky, Bhutasvana, mounted,
shone. ||28|| 1. This is Padma-naga. ||2. That death is skilled in causing
fever. ||

## Chapter Sixty-Seven  Thus, other Vidyaadhara kings, filled with joy, set out
towards Lanka's lord, enraged and ready for battle. ||26||  The warriors,
rushing towards him, their forms like churning seas, met in a fierce clash,
resembling the towering waves of the Ganga. ||30||  Then, Rama and Lakshmana,
their bodies adorned with the brilliance of pure fame, emerged from their abode,
ready for war. ||31||  Mounted on a chariot drawn by lions, clad in armor,
strong and valiant, they shone like the rising sun, Padmaabha leading the way.
||32||  Riding a Garuda chariot, his banner bearing the image of the great
Garuda, his shadow like a towering cloud, his garments dark as the shade, ||33||
Adorned with a crown, earrings, bow, armor, quiver, and arrows, Lakshmana, his
form like the crimson of twilight, shone brightly. ||34||  Other great
Vidyaadharas, the celestial beings of Bhaalangkaara-pura, along with the
श्रेणिक, emerged, riding various vehicles and flying chariots. ||35||  As they
moved, the birds, with their sweet, gentle calls, filled the air, delighting the
inhabitants of their chosen lands. ||36||  Facing them, enraged, endowed with
immense strength, and swift as a raging fire, Ravana advanced. ||37||  From the
heavens, Gandharvas and Apsaras showered flowers upon the warriors of both
armies. ||38||  Protected by infantry on all sides, guided by skilled
charioteers, the elephants, their forms like the Anjana mountain, stood,
intoxicated with pride. ||39||  Chariots, resembling the sun's chariot, drawn by
swift horses, guided by charioteers, filled the air with their thunderous roar,
moving with great speed. ||40||  The infantry, filled with joy, their weapons

battlefield. ||41||  1. शैत-म०  2. संध्यासक्तां जनांगाभसुमित्राजो म०

In the Padma Purana:  The warriors mounted on the backs of horses, holding
spears, lances, and shields in their hands, and their chests covered with armor,
entered the battlefield. \\42\\  They covered each other, competed with each
other, conquered each other, were defeated by each other, were killed, and made
the sound of war. \\43\\  Some fiery horses were wandering around in confusion,
and somewhere a fierce battle with fists and maces had erupted. \\44\\  Some had
their chests wounded by swords, some were struck by arrows, and some were hit by
spears, and they were attacking the enemy in the same way. \\45\\  Some were
constantly pampered and engaged in fulfilling their desired objectives. Their
senses were being liberated like unfaithful friends leaving them. \\46\\  Some
had their intestines hanging out, unable to bear the severe pain, and they were
falling down along with the enemy, their lips bitten by their teeth. \\47\\
Those who were once playful on the palace roofs, loved by beautiful women, they
were now lying on the battlefield, their bodies cut by discuses and gold, \\48\\
and being eaten by vultures and jackals, their forms distorted. \\49\\  Like a
loving woman approaching her sleeping husband with the intention of scratching
him with her nails, a jackal was approaching a fallen warrior on the
battlefield. \\50\\  Seeing his movement, she became confused, thinking he was
alive, and retreated in fear, just as a sorceress's female demon flees from a
mantra practitioner. \\51\\  Recognizing the brave warrior as alive, a bird
slowly moved away, apprehensive, like an unchaste woman who, seeing her husband
alive, retreats with trembling eyes. \\52\\  The nature of auspicious and
inauspicious deeds of the beings was manifested there through victory and
defeat. \\53\\  Some, by the power of their good deeds, conquered many, while
many who had committed sins earlier also faced defeat. \\54\\  Mingled with
envy, which they had earned earlier, they were victorious, defeated, and met
their end there. \\55\\

## Chapter Sixty-Seven  **56.** Dharma protects the vital parts, Dharma conquers
the unconquerable. Dharma is the support, Dharma sees everything.  **57.** Even
with divine chariots drawn by horses, elephants like mountains, horses swift as
the wind, and soldiers radiant like Asuras, a man devoid of past good deeds
cannot be protected.  **58.** A man protected by past good deeds conquers his
enemy alone.  **59.** Thus, in the midst of a fierce battle filled with valiant
warriors, the warriors were so entangled with other warriors that they had no
space.  **60.** With weapons shining, many warriors were leaping up and many
were falling down dead. The sky became as if covered with storm clouds.  **61.**
Maricha, Chandranikara, Vajraksha, Shuka, Saran, and other Rakshasa kings drove
back the enemy army.  **62.** Then Hanuman, Chandrarashmi, Neel, Kumud, and
other monkey kings like Bhutasvana destroyed the Rakshasa army.  **63.** Then,
Kund, Kumbha, Nikumbha, Vikrama, Shrijambumali, Suryara, Makardhwaja, and
Vajraratha, the great kings of the Rakshasa side, and their valiant warriors
stood ready to help.  **64.** Then, Bhoodhara, Achal, Sameda, Vikala, Kutila,
Angada, Sushena, Kalchakra, and Urmitaranga, the monkey warriors, stood ready to
support their side and faced them. At that time, no warrior was seen without an
opponent.  **65-66.** Just as a great elephant plays in a lotus-filled lake, so
too, Anjana's son Hanuman, mounted on a chariot drawn by elephants, was playing
in the battlefield.  **67.** Gautama Swami says, "O Shrenika! That one valiant
warrior, who acts according to his will, made the great army of Rakshasas like
madmen - he made them lose their senses."  **68.** Meanwhile, Maya, the great
demon, whose eyes were corrupted by anger, came and attacked Hanuman.  **69.**
Raising his arrow, he, whose eyes were like lotuses, showered Hanuman's chariot
with fierce arrows.

58 Padma Purana Having mounted the chariot, he again attacked Yudhishthira. His
chariot was shattered by the arrows of Sri Saila. ||7|| Seeing him bewildered,
Dasamukha quickly created a chariot with his multiform knowledge. ||72||
Mounting that chariot, named Prajvalitotama, the great luminous one, bound the
chariotless Hanuman. ||73|| Seeing the monkey-bannered soldiers running, the
Rakshasa soldiers said, "He has received the fruit of his actions, the opposite
of what he did." ||74|| Seeing Hanuman disarmed, Vaidehi ran. He too was made
chariotless by the rain of arrows of Maya. ||75|| Then the king of Kishkindha,
enraged, stood before him. He too was disarmed by the Daitya and thrown to the
ground. ||76|| Then Vibhishana, filled with rage, stood before Maya. A fierce
battle ensued between them, each striking the other with arrows. ||77|| Seeing
the armor of Kaikesi's son broken, his body covered in blood, resembling a red
Asoka tree, ||78|| seeing Vibhishana bewildered, terrified, and fleeing, the
monkey-bannered army weakened, Rama prepared to fight. ||79|| Mounting his
chariot, adorned with the knowledge of the gods, he roared, "Fear not!" and with
a smile, he rushed forward. ||80|| He entered the enemy army, resembling a dense
cloud of rain with lightning, his radiance like the morning sun. ||81|| When
Rama was about to destroy the enemy army, Hanuman, Vaidehi, and Vibhishana
regained their courage. ||82|| The monkey army, having received strength from
Rama, their fear completely gone, again prepared to fight. ||83|| When the
weapons rained down, causing the gods to tremble, the world seemed to be
another, devoid of light. ||84|| Then Rama, with little effort, showered Maya
with arrows, just as Indra showered the demon Vrtra with arrows. ||85|| Seeing
Maya completely bewildered by Rama's arrows, Ravana, enraged, rushed forward,
his radiance like that of Yama, the god of death. ||86||

Caturhsaptatimatam parva Then the supremely powerful Lakshmana spoke. "O bird,
where have I seen you before? Even today, you wretched thief, you evil one, you
despicable person who is like a moth attracted to another's wife, you vile man,
you evil-doer, stand and fight!" (87)  "Today I shall deal with your audacious
act. Even the angry Yama (the god of death) would not do what I, in my fury,
shall do to you." (89)   "This Raghava deity is today the lord of the entire
earth. The righteous-minded one commands me to slay the thief that you are."
(60)  Enraged, Ravana then said to Lakshmana, "O fool! Is it not well known in
this world that whatever precious thing is on the earth, I am the rightful owner
of it? And since I am the king, it is befitting that it be with me." (61-62)
Lakshmana replied, "I know well what kind of lord you are. O sinner! What more
is there to say in this matter? I shall now suppress all your roaring." (16)
Thereupon, Ravana, dark like a rain-cloud, obstructed Lakshmana with his arrows,
just as a mountain obstructs the rain. (17) But Lakshmana, the remover of his
arrows, destroyed his arrows in the mid-air with his own arrows whose connection
with the bow was not even seen. (18)

In the Padma Purana,  (10)  The wise Lakshmana, using the Vayu Astra, destroyed
the Mahendra Astra in a moment.  (102)  Then, with his face ablaze with anger,
Ravana launched the Agneya Astra, setting all directions aflame.  (103)
Lakshmana, in turn, countered with the Varuna Astra, extinguishing the Agneya
Astra in an instant, rendering it useless.  (104)  Then, the son of Kaikeyi
launched the Papa Astra at Ravana, who countered it with the Dharma Astra.
(105)  Lakshmana then used the Indhana Astra, which Ravana also countered with
an Indhana Astra, rendering it ineffective.  (106)  Ravana then filled the sky
with trees bearing fruits and flowers, creating a dense canopy.  (107)
Lakshmana then enveloped Ravana in a cloud of Tamasa Astras, darkening the sky.
(108)  Ravana, in response, destroyed the Tamasa Astra with the Sahasra Kirana
Astra and then launched the Dandashaka Astra, its fangs flashing.  (109)
Lakshmana countered the Dandashaka Astra with the Garuda Astra, filling the sky
with a golden glow.  (110)  Lakshmana then launched the Uraga Astra, a serpent-
like weapon, with a roar like a storm cloud, spewing forth unbearable fiery
venom.  (111)  Ravana, undeterred, countered with the Vahana Astra and then
launched the Vighna Vinayaka Astra, a weapon impossible to counter.  (112)  When
the Vighna Vinayaka Astra, designed to obstruct, was launched, Lakshmana was
confused, unsure which divine weapon to use in response.  (113)  He then began
to launch numerous arrows tipped with wooden shafts, while Ravana continued to
fight with his natural arrows.  (114)  The battle between Lakshmana and Ravana
raged with arrows reaching their ears, as fierce as the previous battles at
Triprishtha and Ashvagrova.  (115)  Vighna Vinayaka Astra, M.

The Seventy-Fourth Parva **Upajati-Vrittam**  When the **karma** (actions) of
past lives, which are the motivators, arise, humans experience the fruits of
their actions, whether they are **siddh** (perfect) or **asiddha** (imperfect).
||115||  Those who are consumed by **tiivra krodha** (intense anger) and whose
minds are focused on the completion of their tasks, do not consider weapons,
fire, the sun, or the wind. ||116||  Thus ends the Seventy-Fourth Parva of the
**Padma Purana**, narrated by **Ravishena Acharya**, renowned for its
**aarshanama** (ancient lineage), and which describes the battle between
**Ravana** and **Lakshmana**. ||74||

## The Fifty-Seventh Chapter  **1.** Sweet and cool water is given to those who
are distressed and thirsty, this is the law of battle, as ordained by the great
sages.  **2.** Food like nectar is given to those who are hungry, and sandalwood
paste is given to those who are sweating, as a source of comfort.  **3.** Wind
from palm trees and ice-cold water are used in battle, and other tasks are
performed by those who are nearby, with utmost dedication.  **4.** This is the
law of battle, for both sides, for one's own and the enemy's. This is how the
complete fulfillment of duty is achieved.  **5.** Ten days had passed in the
fierce battle between the two mighty warriors, Lakshmana and Ravana, both of
whom were immensely strong and had lost their wealth.  **6.** The battle between
Lakshmana and Ravana was like the battle between Ravana and Lakshmana, meaning
their battle was equal in intensity.  **7.** The Yakshas, Kinnaras, Gandharvas,
and Apsaras were filled with wonder, showering blessings and flowers upon them.
**8.** Eight daughters of Chandravardhana, the king of the Vidyadharas, were
seated on the top of their celestial chariots in the sky.  **9.** The Apsaras,
filled with curiosity, asked the daughters, who were protected by their powerful
guards, "Who are you, with your divine forms and delicate bodies? It seems you
are deeply devoted to Lakshmana."  **10.** The daughters, blushing, replied, "If
you are curious, listen. When Sita's Swayamvara was taking place, our father,
driven by curiosity, went to the assembly hall with us. Seeing Lakshmana there,
he decided to give us to him."  **11.** "Upon returning, he told our mother
about this, and from the moment we saw him, our hearts were set on him."

## Chapter Fifty-Seven  This great battle is filled with uncertainty. We are
distressed, wondering what will become of this. ||14||  The fate of this moon
among men, this beloved of our hearts, Lakshmana, is our fate. ||15||  Hearing
their sweet words, Lakshmana raised his eyes and looked at them. ||16||  Seeing
him, those noble maidens were filled with joy and exclaimed, "O Lord, may you be
victorious in all ways! May your desires be fulfilled!" ||17||  Hearing the word
"victory" from their lips, Lakshmana remembered the weapon named "Victory" and
his face lit up. He felt fulfilled. ||18||  Then, with the great weapon
"Victory," Lakshmana swiftly destroyed Ravana's "Obstacle-Destroyer" weapon. He
was ready for battle. ||19||  Ravana, skilled in weaponry, wielded every weapon
he could, but Lakshmana, master of the supreme weapons, cut them all down.
||20||  Then, Lakshmana's arrows, bearing the emblem of Garuda, the king of
birds, filled all directions, like clouds covering the mountains. ||21||
Ravana, entering the knowledge of the multi-formed goddess Vidya, engaged in the
play of battle. ||22||  Lakshmana's sharp arrows repeatedly severed Ravana's
head, adorned with shining earrings, but it repeatedly grew back. ||23||  One
head was severed, and two grew in its place. Two were severed, and they doubled
in number. ||24||  Two arms were cut off, and four grew in their place. Four
were cut off, and they doubled in number. ||25||  Ravana was surrounded by
thousands of heads and countless arms, like a lotus surrounded by countless
petals. ||26||  His arms, shaped like elephant trunks, adorned with armlets, and
his head, filling the sky, became a cage of weapons and jewels. ||27||

In the Padma Purana,  The ocean of demons, Ravana, grew larger and larger, with
thousands of heads like crocodiles and towering waves of arms. ||28|| Or, the
cloud of demons, Ravana, grew larger and larger, with thunderous arms like
lightning bolts and a terrifying roar, with a multitude of heads like peaks.
||26|| Ravana, though alone, was like a vast army, with the sound of his arms
and heads clashing, like the clatter of shields and ornaments. ||30|| "I have
fought many before, what can I do against this one?" Thinking this, Lakshmana
multiplied himself. ||31|| Ravana, ablaze with the light of his jeweled weapons
and ornaments, resembled a burning forest. ||32|| Ravana, with his thousands of
arms, rained down a torrent of weapons, including discs, arrows, javelins, and
spears, trying to cover Lakshmana. ||33|| Lakshmana, filled with rage and devoid
of fear, was determined to cover his enemy with arrows like the rays of the sun.
||34|| He cut off the heads of his enemy, one, two, three, four, five, six, ten,
twenty, a hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand. ||35|| The sky, covered with
thousands of heads and falling arms, resembled a falling meteor, with a shower
of stars. ||36|| The battlefield, constantly covered with arms and heads, shone
with the beauty of a lotus pond, adorned with the hoods of serpents. ||37|| As
each new head and arm appeared, Lakshmana cut them off, just as a sage cuts off
new karmas as they arise. ||38|| The sky, filled with streams of flowing blood,
seemed like a new sky, where twilight was being created. ||39|| Gautama Swami
says, "Behold, Lakshmana, with his two arms, filled with great power, has
rendered Ravana, the wielder of countless arms, a mere body without purpose."
||40|| Behold, how Ravana, the mighty, has been reduced in a moment! His breath
has stopped, his face is covered with beads of sweat, and his entire body is
filled with fear and anxiety. ||41|| O Shrenika! While he was still in this
state,

The 65th Chapter  A fierce battle ensues. Enraged, Ravana, regaining his
composure, contemplates the chakra-ratna, which shines like the midday sun at
the end of the world and is capable of destroying the enemy forces. ||42-43||
This chakra-ratna, a repository of infinite brilliance, adorned with strings of
pearls, self-illuminating, divine, with a vajra-like face, and incredibly
wondrous, is adorned with various gems, divine garlands, and unguents. Its
circular rays, resembling a fiery wall, are difficult to behold. It is guarded
by a thousand yakshas, always vigilant, and resembles the face of Yama, the god
of death, associated with the end of the world. This chakra, after
contemplation, appeared in his hand. ||44-47||  The sun, deprived of its
brilliance by this radiant divine weapon, is reduced to a mere shadow of its
former self, resembling a painted sun. ||48||  Gandharvas, Apsaras, Vishvavasus,
Tumburu, and Narada, abandoning the sight of the battle, have gone somewhere,
forgetting their songs. ||49||  Having decided that death is inevitable,
Lakshmana, though a man of great fortitude, addressed the enemy in a loud voice,
saying, "O vile wretch! Why do you stand like a miser, even after obtaining this
chakra? If you have any strength, strike!" ||50-51||  Thus addressed, Ravana,
consumed with rage, gnashing his teeth, his eyes radiating a circular, vast
brilliance, hurled the chakra-ratna. This chakra-ratna, imbued with the fury of
a storm cloud, roared with a terrifying sound, moved with great speed, and was a
cause of fear for humans. ||52-53||  Seeing this chakra-ratna, resembling the
sun at the end of the world, approaching him, Lakshmana, ready to stop it, aimed
his vajra-tipped arrows. ||54||  Ramachandra, with his swift Vastravarta bow in
one hand and a spinning, sharp-edged plow in the other, Sugriva, bearing the
weight of great fury, with his mace, Bhammandala, with his sharp sword,
Vibhishana, with his weapon that destroys enemies,

In the Padma Purana, Bibhratsuग्रीव, bearing the greatest confusion, held a
mace. He was beautiful with a halo of light, and stood at the head of the
circle. (56) Vibhishana, with a trident, stood against the enemy. He was born of
the wind, and held a meteor, a mace, a club, and gold. (57) Angada, with a
thunderbolt, held a sharp axe. The other celestial kings, too, held their
weapons. (58) United, they were all eager to die, but even together, they could
not stop the Chakra Ratna, protected by Indra. (59) Then, coming and circling
thrice around Lakshmana, the protector of the three worlds, the Chakra Ratna,
peaceful and calm, willingly rested in Lakshmana's hand. (60) Gautama Swami
said, "O Shrenik! I have briefly told you this most wondrous, great, and world-
renowned story of Rama and Lakshmana, full of great fortune." (61) When the time
of good fortune arrives for one person, great fortune manifests. When good
fortune is lost, the time of destruction arrives for another, just as the moon
rises and the sun sets. (62) Thus ends the seventy-fifth chapter of the Padma
Purana, known as the "Aarya," narrated by the sage Ravishena, describing the
birth of Lakshmana's Chakra Ratna. (73)

## The Sixty-Seventh Chapter  Seeing Lakshmana, adorned with the newly-born
Chakra-ratna, the Vidya-dhara kings rejoiced and exclaimed in praise. || 1 ||
They said, "As the Lord Ananta-virya had prophesied, the eighth Krishna-tayuja,
the one who is Narayana, has been born. He is the one with the Chakra in his
hand, radiating great brilliance. His form is most excellent, he is glorious,
and his strength is beyond description. || 2-3 ||  And this is Bala-deva, the
eighth, whose chariot is drawn by lions with erect manes, shining like the sun.
|| 4 ||  He is the one who imprisoned the great Daitya Maya in battle, and in
whose hand the gem-like plough shines brightly. || 5 ||  These two, Rama and
Narayana, are both Purushottama, born through the power of punya, and bound by
the greatest love. || 6 ||  Seeing the Sudarshana Chakra in Lakshmana's hand,
the king of the Rakshasas, Ravana, was filled with anxiety. || 7 ||  He thought,
"The divine words spoken by the venerable Ananta-virya, the Kevali, seem to have
come to pass. This karma, driven by the wind, has arrived." || 8 ||  At the
sight of his banner, the Vidya-dhara kings were terrified, and great armies,
with their banners and flags, were destroyed. The ocean's water is his garment,
and the Himalayas and Vindhyas are his breasts. The three-part earth is his
servant, obedient to his command. || 9-10 ||  How is it that I, who am a mere
earth-dweller, am destined to be defeated by him? Alas, this is a difficult
situation! Look at this wonder! || 11 ||  Shame on this royal fortune, who
behaves like a harlot, abandoning those who are long-cherished and virtuous, to
consort with the wicked! || 12 ||  These pleasures of the five senses are like
the fruit of the Kimpaka tree, bitter in their ripeness, causing endless
suffering, and condemned by the virtuous. || 13 ||

In the Padma Purana, Those men, starting with Bharata, are blessed, the best of
beings. They possess a vast kingdom, adorned with the jewel of the Chakra, free
from thorns. ||14|| Having abandoned the mixed food, they embraced the Jain
vows, worshipping the three jewels, and attained the supreme state. ||15||
Overwhelmed by the extremely powerful delusion, the architect of worldly
existence, I, the wretched one, am defeated. I am ashamed of my actions. ||16||
Seeing Vibhishana, Lakshmana, the possessor of the Chakra jewel, born from the
womb of the ocean, said to the Vidhyadharas, who are worshipped by the birds,
"If you still surrender Sita and say, 'I am alive by the grace of Ramadeva,'
then your fortune will remain as it is. For the righteous attain their goal by
causing the downfall of the arrogant." ||17-18|| Then, smiling, Ravana said to
Lakshmana, "Oh, your baseless pride is in vain!" ||20|| "O lowly one, I will
show you the state you will experience. I am the same Ravana, and you are just a
dweller of the earth." ||21|| Then Lakshmana said, "What is the use of much
talk? I am born to kill you, the very Narayana." ||22|| Then, with a sarcastic
tone, Ravana said, "If you become Narayana just by wishing, then why don't you
become Indra by wishing?" ||23|| "Your father banished you, and you wandered in
the forest, filled with sorrow. Now, you are shameless and claim to be Narayana.
I know your Narayanahood well." ||24|| "Whether you are Narayana or something
else, whatever is in your mind, I will shatter your desires right now." ||25||
"You have achieved your goal with this blazing Chakra. It is like a great
festival for the lowly creatures, even with a wicked object." ||26|| "What more
to say? Today, I will send you straight to hell with these wicked Vidhyadharas,
along with the Chakra and the vehicle." ||27|| Hearing these words, the new
Narayana, Lakshmana, in anger, whirled around and hurled the Chakra towards
Ravana. ||28|| That Chakra, at that time, was like a thunderous roar of a cloud,
born from a thunderbolt, as dark as the sun at the time of dissolution. ||29||

## The Sixty-Seventh Chapter  **Hiranyakashipu** had attempted to stop the
discus hurled by **Hari** (Vishnu), just as **Ravana**, filled with rage, tried
to stop it with arrows. [30]  **Ravana**, though he tried to stop it with a
sharp club and swift wind, could not stop the crooked discus, as his **punya**
(merit) was depleted. [31]  **Ravana** then drew his **Chandrahasa** sword and
struck the approaching discus, causing sparks to fill the sky. [32]  The discus,
however, struck **Ravana**, who was standing directly in its path, shattering
his chest, which was as hard as a diamond. [33]  **Ravana**, like a huge
**Anjanagiri** mountain driven by the winds of a cataclysm, fell to the earth,
his **punya** (merit) having been exhausted. [34]  **Ravana**, lying on the
earth, his teeth clenched, looked like **Kamadeva** (the god of love) asleep, or
a god fallen from heaven. [35]  Seeing their master fall, the army, making a
sound like the ocean, scattered, abandoning their banners and umbrellas. [36]
"Move the chariot, clear the way, bring the horse here, the elephant is coming
from behind, move the aircraft to the side, oh, our master has fallen, what a
calamity!" - the army, filled with fear, ran in all directions, uttering these
words. [37-38]  Seeing these helpless people, who were clinging to each other,
trembling with fear, and whose heads were bowed to the ground, **Sugriva**,
**Hanuman**, and the others, reassured them, saying, "Do not fear, do not fear."
[39-40]  The army was comforted by the sweet words of **Sugriva** and the
others, who had their garments fluttering in the wind, like nectar to their
ears. [41]  **Gautama Swami** says, "O **Shrenika**, in this world, bounded by
the ocean, there are many wondrous deeds, such as..." [42]

Padma Purana Dhigi-dashi, Sriyamati, fickle-minded, devoid of the desire for
good deeds. This is clearly established in the mind. O people, become possessors
of the wealth of penance, become radiant with the brilliance of penance. ||43||
Thus ends the 76th chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the "Ravana-vadha"
(killing of Ravana), narrated by the Acharya Ravishena. ||76|| Ravana enjoyed
Lakshmi, but due to the destruction of his virtuous deeds, he met this fate.
||42|| Therefore, this Lakshmi, who is extremely fickle and devoid of hope for
attaining virtue, is to be condemned. O noble people! Contemplate this in your
minds and become possessors of the wealth of penance, become radiant with the
brilliance of penance. ||43|| Thus ends the 76th chapter of the Padma Purana,
known as the "Ravana-vadha" (killing of Ravana), narrated by the Acharya
Ravishena. ||76||

## The Seventy-Seventh Chapter  Seeing his brother fallen, Vibhishana, filled
with immense sorrow, placed his hand on a dagger to end his own life. ||1||
His wives, preventing his death, and striving to revive him, fainted and
rendered him great service. ||2||  Regaining consciousness, he was again
consumed by the unbearable pain of wanting to die. Rama, with great effort,
pulled him out of his chariot. ||3||  Vibhishana, having discarded his armor,
fell unconscious on the ground. When he regained consciousness, he began to
lament in a way that moved everyone to tears. ||4||  "Alas, my brother! You, the
compassionate, the generous, the valiant, the protector of the helpless, the
beautiful! How have you fallen into this state of sin?" ||5||  "Oh, my lord! Did
you not heed my words, which were for your benefit? That is why I see you struck
by the discus in the battle." ||6||  "Oh, god! Oh, lord of the Vidyadharas! Oh,
king of Lanka! You, who were always immersed in pleasures, why are you lying on
the ground today?" ||7||  "Oh, speaker of sweet words! Oh, treasure of virtues!
Arise and speak to me. Oh, support of compassion! Console me, who am drowning in
the ocean of sorrow." ||8||  Meanwhile, the news of Ravana's fall reached the
inner palace, which was filled with waves of sorrow and grief. ||9||  All the
women, their faces drenched in tears, and their steps faltering, rushed to the
battlefield. ||10||  Seeing their beloved husband, who was as beautiful as the
jewel on the crown of the earth, lying unconscious, they fell to the ground in a

In the Padma Purana, It is seen that Padmavati's beauty, love, evening assembly,
and auspiciousness, Prabhavati's emotional intensity, Ratikantā's mind, and
Manovati, etc., eighteen thousand women surrounded their husband and began to
weep with great sorrow. ||12-16|| Those who were sprinkled with sandalwood
water, many women attained fainting, those whose lotus stalks were uprooted,
they were adorned with the beauty of the lotus. ||17|| Many women, embracing
their beloved, attained deep fainting, they were adorned with the radiance of
the evening line, connected with the mountain of collyrium. ||18|| Many women,
whose fainting had gone away and who were playful in beating their chests, were
adorned with the form of a lightning garland, flashing like a dense cloud.
||19|| One woman, placing her husband's lotus face in her lap, was extremely
distraught and fainted repeatedly, touching her chest. ||20|| They were saying,
"Alas, alas, O Lord! Where have you gone, leaving me, who am so timid? Why don't
you look at your people who are drowned in sorrow?" ||21|| O King! You are
endowed with the virtue of fortitude, adorned with the ornament of beauty, the
bearer of supreme fame, like Indra in glory, proud, the lord of the land of
Bharata, the chief man, the one who delights the mind, and the king of the
Vidyadharas, why are you sleeping on this earth like this? ||22-23|| O Beloved!
O Compassionate, O Kind to your own people! Arise, give us one sweet word like
nectar. ||24|| O Lord of Life! We are free from sin and our minds are devoted to
you alone, why then have you attained this anger? ||25|| O Lord! This moon-like
face of yours, which is delightful with the radiance of your teeth, engaged in
playful talk, adorn it once again as before. ||26|| This beautiful chest of
yours is the playground of excellent women, yet how did this wheel-bearing one
find a place on it? ||27|| O Lord! This red lip of yours, like the flower of the
afternoon, why is it not fluttering at this time to give a playful answer?
||28|| Be pleased, you have never been angry for so long.

## The Seventy-Seventh Chapter  He who was cast down from the Kalpa-loka and
took birth from you, that Meghavahana and Indrajit, is suffering in the bonds of
the enemy. ||30||  O valiant one, knowing good deeds, full of virtues, make your
brother Kumbhakarna and your sons happy with Padmaabha and release them from
their bonds. ||31||  O Lord of life, arise, give a sweet word. O God, why are
you sleeping for so long? Arise and perform your royal duties. ||32||  O holder
of beautiful gestures, O beloved, O lover of lovers, be pleased and pacify our
limbs burning with the fire of separation. ||33||  O heart, why don't you break
into a hundred pieces seeing the lotus face of your beloved in this state?
||34||  This heart, surely made of diamond, is a vessel of sorrow. Even knowing
your state, it remains unmoved, heartless. ||35||  O Creator, what wrong did we
do to you, that you did this deed, which is difficult even for the heartless?
||36||  O Lord, the sweet taste of mutual surrender, which we enjoyed, by just
embracing, far away from pride. ||37||  O beloved, what else, when there was a
slip in taking the name of another woman, I bound you many times with the
girdle. ||38||  O Lord, I, with trembling lips from anger, struck you with the
blue lotus of your ear ornament, and the saffron of that lotus went to your
forehead. ||39||  O Lord, to destroy the anger of love, speaking sweet words,
you lifted our feet and placed them on your head, which immediately melted our
hearts. And O Supreme Lord, O beloved, those extremely delightful pleasures,
accompanied by sweet words, which we enjoyed with you as desired. ||40-41||  O
beautiful one, those acts, bringing supreme joy, are now remembered one by one,
burning fiercely in the heart. ||42||  O Lord, be gracious, arise, I bow to your
feet. Anger does not look good on loved ones for a long time. ||43||  Thus, even
hearing the lamentations of Ravana's wives, whose heart did not become filled
with compassion? ||44||

1998 Padmapurana Then, Padmanabha and Saumitri, along with the best of the
celestial beings, embraced Vibhishana, their eyes filled with affection, and
spoke words of compassion, being experts in consoling others and wise in the
ways of the world. ||45|| They said, "O King! This weeping is in vain, now
abandon your sorrow. You know that this is the result of actions. ||47|| Due to
the influence of past karma, those who are negligent are bound to experience
what they deserve. What is the point of sorrow in this? ||48|| When a person
engages in unrighteous actions, he dies then and there. Ravana died long ago, so
why grieve now? ||49|| He who was always devoted to the welfare of the world
with utmost love, whose mind was always alert, who was wise in the affairs of
the people, and whose soul was cleansed by the knowledge of all scriptures, even
such a Ravana was led astray by powerful delusion and attained this terrible
state. ||50-52|| He has experienced destruction due to this sin. Indeed, at the
time of destruction, the minds of men become clouded. ||52|| After Rama spoke,
the wise Bhamandala, adorned with the utmost sweetness, spoke these words.
||53|| He said, "O Vibhishana! The great-souled Ravana, while fighting bravely
in the fierce battle, met his end through a death worthy of a warrior and
attained his rightful place. ||54|| What is lost for him whose honor is not
lost, O Lord? Indeed, he is blessed who gives up his life in the face of the
enemy. ||55|| There is no reason to grieve for that great-souled warrior. Only
those who are like the kings of the earth, who are not conquerors of enemies,
are worthy of sorrow. ||56|| The story is as follows: In the city of Akshapura,
there was a king named Arindama, born of Lakshmi and Haridhwaja, who was
renowned for his wealth, like Indra himself. ||57|| Once, having conquered the
armies of enemies stationed in various lands, he was returning to his own place,
longing to see his wife. ||58||

The Seventy-Seventh Chapter  Filled with utmost anxiety, Ketu, adorned with
banners and toranas, entered the city suddenly with horses swift as thought. ||
56 || Seeing his own house decorated and his beautiful wives adorned, he asked,
"How did you know I was coming, without being told?" || 60 || She said, "My
lord, today the chief among the monks, the wise Kirtidhara, came for Parana. I
asked him about your arrival, and he said that you would arrive suddenly today."
|| 61 || Arindama, filled with envy at the monk's knowledge of the future, went
to him and said, "If you know, then tell me what is in my mind." || 62 || The
monk said, "You have this thought in your mind: When and how will I die?" || 63
|| "You will die on the seventh day from today, struck by lightning, and become
a great worm in your own dung-house." || 64 || Returning from there, King
Arindama told his son, Pritikara, "I will become a great worm in the dung-house,
so you should kill me." || 65 ||   Then, when the son was about to kill the
large worm in the dung-house, the worm, fearing death, fled and hid deep within
the dung. || 66 || Pritikara went to the monk and asked, "O Lord, why does the
worm flee far away when I am about to kill him, as you said?" || 67 || The wise
monk said, "Do not argue about this. The creature finds pleasure in the womb it
enters." || 68 || "Therefore, do that which is beneficial for the soul, so that
it may be freed from sin. It is certain that all beings are engaged in reaping
the fruits of their own actions." || 69 || Knowing this state of existence,
which brings great sorrow, Pritikara, the great yogi, became free from desire.
|| 70 ||   The Sardulavikridita  Thus, Bhamandala says to Vibhishana, "O
Vibhishana! Do you not know the various states of this world, which is governed
by destiny, and which is struck by Narayana, who is fearless and determined in
his resolve? In the battle, facing the chief of men, the grieving Ravana, what
is the reason for your present state of mind, which is filled with sorrow and
self-interest?" || 71 ||

Padma Purana The story of the virtuous, the one who brings joy, is worthy of
being narrated, as it is full of diverse characters and is skilled in giving
awakening. All the celestial kings said, "Well said, well said," and Vibhishana,
the sun, who knows the highest dharma, was freed from the darkness of grief.
Thus ends the seventy-seventh chapter of the Padma Purana, also known as the
Padmayana, narrated by the sage Ravishena, which tells the story of Pritikara.
1. From the darkness of grief.

## The Eighty-Seventh Chapter  Then Haladhara said, "What should be done now?
For the enmity of the wise lasts until death." ||1||  "Let us perform the
funeral rites of the great man, the Lord of the World, who has gone to the other
world, with great joy and a beautiful body." ||2||  Upon hearing these words,
Rama and Vibhishana, along with Lakshmana and the other celestial kings, went to
the place where Mandodari, surrounded by thousands of women, was lamenting like
a cuckoo, overwhelmed with grief. ||3-4||  Rama and Lakshmana descended from the
great elephant and approached Mandodari, accompanied by the chief celestial
beings. ||5||  Seeing them, the women, with their jeweled bracelets broken and
their bodies covered in dust, cried out with a choked voice. ||6||  Rama, wise
and discerning, comforted Mandodari and the entire group of women with soothing
words. ||7||  Then, using camphor, sandalwood, go-shirsha, and other excellent
materials, they performed the funeral rites of Ravana and went to the great lake
called Padma. ||8||  Rama, with his pure mind, sat on the bank of the lake and
said, "Let Kumbhakarna and the others be released along with their followers."
||9||  Hearing this, some of the celestial kings, with cruel hearts, said, "They
are very cruel. They should be killed like enemies, or they should die in their
own bonds." ||10||  Balarama said, "This is not the way of Kshatriyas. Do you
not know the famous code of Kshatriyas? Sleeping, bound, subdued, fearful, and
with grass in their teeth, these warriors are not to be killed. This is the
dharma of Kshatriyas, which shines brightly in the world." ||11-12||  Then,
saying "So be it," the great warriors, armed with various weapons and clad in
armor, went to bring them. ||13||  After that, Indrajit, Kumbhakarna, Maricha,

78 Padma Purana Seeing all of them being brought in like elephants, the
Vidyadharas, who were sitting together, started talking amongst themselves, as
they pleased, saying, "If Indrajit or King Kumbhakarna, seeing the burning pyre
of Ravana, becomes angry, or if even one of them gets upset, then who among the
monkey army, the king, is capable of standing before them?"  ||16||  "Whoever
was sitting wherever, he did not get up from his place, because they had all
seen their strength at the forefront of the battle." ||16||  "Bhammandala told
his chief warriors, "We should not trust Vibhishana yet, because if he gets to
see his relatives freed from their bonds, his sorrow for his brother might cause
him to act irrationally." ||20||  "Thus, surrounded by Bhammandala and others,
who were filled with various doubts, Kumbhakarna and others were brought to Rama
and Lakshmana." ||22||  "Kumbhakarna and all the others, free from attachment
and aversion, had attained the state of a sage in their hearts. They were
looking at the earth with gentle eyes, their faces serene." ||23||  "They had
decided in their minds that there is no essence in this world, only Dharma is
the essence, which is the great friend of all beings. If we are freed from this
bondage, we will become renunciates and take food only with our hands." ||24||
"Having made this vow, they went to Rama. King Kumbhakarna and others went to
Vibhishana." ||26||  "Then, when the conversation about the time of sorrow
gradually ended, Kumbhakarna and others, who were embodiments of peace, said to
Rama and Lakshmana, "Oh, your courage, your depth, your efforts, and your
strength are all excellent, because you have caused the death of Ravana, who was
invincible even to the gods." ||27-28||  "Even though he was a great wrongdoer,
arrogant, and harsh in his speech, if an enemy has excellent qualities, he is
worthy of praise by the wise." ||26|| 1. Yatu m.  2. Khyatum m.  3. Nameti

The Seventy-eighth Chapter 74 Then, consoling them with words that touched their
hearts, the wheel-bearing one (Rama) spoke, saying, "You all remain together,
enjoying your pleasures as before." ||30|| They replied, "We have no need for
pleasures that are like poison, terrible, causing great delusion, and bringing
great sorrow." ||31|| Gautama Swami says, "O Shrenika! At that time, there were
no means left by which they could not be consoled, yet those noble-minded men
did not accept the connection with pleasures." ||32|| Although Narayana and
Balabhadra themselves were following them, that is, trying to persuade them to
accept pleasures, their vision remained turned away from them, just as the
vision that is fixed on the sun is turned away from darkness. ||33|| All of them
bathed in the fragrant water of that lake, whose brilliance was like the
particles of ground collyrium, along with the unbound Kumbhakarna and others.
||34|| Then, emerging from that lotus lake, all the monkeys and demons went to
their respective places, as was appropriate. ||35|| Many celestial beings
gathered in a circle on the beautiful bank of this lake, and, with minds filled
with wonder, they began to tell the story of the valiant heroes. ||36|| Some
celestial beings blamed the cruel-acting fate, while others, speechless, shed
copious tears. ||37|| Many people, whose minds were filled with the qualities of
Ravana, who had come to their memory, were weeping with their throats torn.
||38|| Some were describing the extremely difficult and strange nature of
actions, while others were condemning the extremely difficult forest of the
world. ||39|| Some, having attained the utmost aversion to pleasures, considered
the fortune of the kingdom to be fickle and worthless. ||40|| Some were saying,
"This is the way of heroes," while others, who were holders of excellent
intellect, were condemning the useless and wrong actions. ||41|| Some were
narrating the story of Ravana with pride, some were singing the praises of Rama,
and some were discussing the power of Lakshmana. ||42|| Many heroes, whose heads
were shaking slightly and whose minds were very pure, were not praising Rama,
but were praising the fruits of good deeds. ||43|| At that time, all activities
in every house had come to an end, only the children were engaged in stories.
||44|| Then, 1. - Dashruni.

In the Padma Purana, In Lanka, all the people were shedding tears like rain, and
even the strong houses were crumbling with grief. ||15|| The world was filled
with water, as if it had become a watery body, due to the tears flowing from
everyone's eyes. ||46|| The intense sorrow had taken root in their hearts, and
they were terrified by the flow of tears from everyone's eyes. ||47|| "Alas,
what a terrible calamity! What a strange thing has happened!" Such words were
uttered by the people, along with their tears. ||48|| Some people sat silently
on the ground, their faces still, their bodies motionless, as if they were clay
statues. ||49|| Some people broke their weapons, threw away their ornaments, and
turned away their eyes from the faces of women, like lotus flowers. ||50|| From
the mouths of many people, hot, long, and polluted breaths were coming out, as
if their sorrow was sprouting endlessly. ||51|| Some people, having attained
complete detachment from the world, were taking the Digambara initiation, as
spoken by the Jinas, in their minds. ||52|| Then, at the end of that day, the
Muni Anantavirya, accompanied by a great assembly of monks, arrived in Lanka.
||53|| Gautama Swami says, "If that great Muni had come to Lanka while Ravana
was alive, there would have been great affection between Ravana and Lakshmana."
||54|| For in the land where the Muni, endowed with great powers, and the Kevali
reside, the earth for two hundred yojanas around becomes like heaven, free from
all troubles, and the kings who live nearby become free from enmity. ||55-56||
Just as the sky is naturally formless and the wind is naturally fickle, so too
does the great Muni naturally have the power to bring joy to people. ||57||
Gautama Swami says, "O Shrenika, who can describe how Anantavirya Muni,
surrounded by many wondrous monks, arrived in Lanka?" ||58|| He was adorned with
many powers, 1. Anantavirya. 2. Sankasha-samyata-dha.

## The Eighty-Seventh Chapter  Sixty thousand celestial beings, great sages,
shone there, seated, surrounded like the moon by stars. ||60||  The Muni, seated
on a pure, secluded rock, engaged in white meditation, attained Kevala Jnana in
that very night. ||61||  O Shrenik! Listen to the wondrous, delightful
description of his extraordinary qualities, which dispel sin. ||12||  And then,
with the arising of Kevala Jnana, the Muni, freed from the obstacle of Viriya
Karma, became the master of infinite strength and ascended the divine throne.
From the netherworld, the dwellers of the earth, the Vayu Kumaras, Naga Kumaras,
Vidyut Kumaras, and Suparna Kumaras, along with the eight types of Vyantara
beings, starting with the Kinnaras, the five types of celestial beings,
including the Sun, Moon, and planets, and the sixteen types of Kalpavasis,
including the Saudharma, all the Devas from the four realms, had gone to the
festival celebrating the birth of a Tirthankara in the Ghataki Khandadvipa.
There, they had performed a grand puja and, with auspicious, jeweled and golden
pitchers, had bathed the Devadhideva, the Jina, the child, and praised him with
beautiful words. Then, returning from there, they had placed the Jina child,
who, even in his childhood, was free from childish fickleness, in his mother's
lap. After paying their respects to the Jina child, the Devas, filled with joy,
returned from Mount Meru and performed the appropriate rituals, like the Tandava
dance, at the Tirthankara's home. Then, returning from there, they came to Lanka
to witness the celebration of the Muni's Kevala Jnana and approached him. Drawn
by the Muni's influence, some of the Devas rode in magnificent chariots, adorned
with large garlands of jewels, shining like the sun, and of appropriate size.
Some rode on white, magnificent swans, like conch shells. Some rode on elephants
whose temples, due to the intoxicating fragrance of their superior musk, were
swollen and adorned with swarms of black bees. Some rode on tigers and lions
with fearsome faces and teeth like young moons. All the Devas, with joyful
hearts, approached the Muni. At that time, the sound of drums,   1. This section
is written in a rhythmic prose style, with hints of the Bhujangaprayata meter
throughout. ||11-3||

82 Puranas  The sky was filled with the sounds of drums, the melodious notes of
the veena and the flute, the jingling of cymbals, the roar of conch shells, the
thunderous rumble of clouds, the deep resonant sound of the duṇḍubhi, and the
enchanting music of celestial maidens.  Seeing the light of the approaching army
in the darkness, and hearing the sound of the drums, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were
initially apprehensive, but upon learning the truth, they were filled with joy.
The army of the monkeys and the demons were in such a frenzy that it seemed as
if the ocean itself was churning.  Then, driven by devotion, the celestial
beings, including Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, and the demons, including Bhānukaṛṇa,
Indrajit, and Meghavāhana, set out to meet the sage. Some rode on elephants,
some on chariots, and some on horses. They were adorned with white umbrellas,
banners, and yak-tail whisks, and they filled the sky as they approached.  Just
as Indra enters his pleasure garden, surrounded by a throng of Gandharvas,
Yakṣas, and Apsaras, so too did all the beings descend from their vehicles,
leaving behind their banners and umbrellas, and enter the Kusumāyudha garden of
Lanka.  Approaching the sage, they paid their respects, bowing down to his lotus
feet, and praising him with hymns and mantras.  Then, with a desire to hear the
Dharma, they sat down on the ground, their minds focused, and listened intently
to the words of the sage.  He said, "There are four paths in this world: hell,
animal life, human life, and the life of the gods.  All beings, bound by the
eight karmas, wander endlessly on the wheel of suffering, creating both good and
bad karma.  They are always consumed by anger and greed, and their minds are
clouded by delusion.  These beings engage in killing, lying, stealing, adultery,
and the accumulation of wealth, driven by the passion of greed.

The Eighty-seventh Chapter  They fall down below, to the earth-gems, sugar-
light, sand-light, mud-light, smoke-light, and great darkness, which are always
filled with great darkness, foul-smelling, repulsive, ugly, and painful to
touch. They are extremely terrible, like molten iron, and are filled with cries,
screams, and fear. There, the hell-beings, bound by sin, due to evil deeds,
always experience great intense suffering, like the state of many oceans.
Knowing this, the wise, with hearts filled with aversion to the bonds of sin,
delight in good conduct, uncorrupted by the rules of vows, and with natural
integrity and radiance of virtues, some attain human existence, others, through
various austerities, attain the abode of the gods. Fallen from there, they again
attain human existence, abandoning their desire for dharma. Those who shine with
such merit, freed from rebirth and death, wander in the midst of the vast
wilderness of suffering, their hopes shattered.  Then, others, who are
established in the dharma of the worthy, are deeply influenced by the words of
the Lord of Lords, and following the path of liberation, are intensely devoted
to conduct, truth, purity, right austerity, vision, knowledge, and conduct. They
strive to destroy the eight types of karma, and thus, endowed with the highest
excellence, become the supreme masters of the gods. There, they enjoy countless
pleasures, like the ocean. Then, falling from there, they obtain the fruits of
the remaining dharma, enjoy great pleasures, attain prosperity, and abandoning
kingdoms and other worldly possessions, they embrace the Jain insignia, perform
intense austerities, become holders of white meditation, attain omniscience, and
when their lifespan is exhausted, free from all karma, they ascend to the
highest part of the three worlds, become liberated, and attain the supreme,
infinite, blissful, self-nature.  The Story of the Previous Birth  Then,
Indrajeet and Meghavahana asked the Muni, the Lord of the Munis, about their
previous birth. He replied, "In the city of Kaushambi, there were two brothers
born into a poor family."

The first one was named 'Prathama' and the second was called 'Paschima'. One
day, while wandering, Bhavadatta Muni came to that city. ||63-64|| Hearing the
Dharma from them, both brothers became small. One day, the king of that city,
named Indunama, who was radiant, came to see the Muni. Seeing him, the Muni sat
with indifference. He did not show any respect to the king. The reason for this
was that the wise Muni knew that the king's false vision was a remedy - it could
not be removed. ||65-66|| After that, after the king left, the city's Jain
devotee, Nandi, came to see the Muni. That Seth was equal to the king in wealth
and the Muni showed him due respect. ||67|| Seeing Nandi Seth hurt by the Muni,
Paschima, the small one, tied a nidana saying that I am the son of Nandi Seth.
In reality, he was doing Dharma for this very reason. ||68|| Although he was
explained a lot, his mind did not move away from that side, in the end, he died
with a contaminated mind from the nidana bandha and after dying, he became the
son of Indumukhi, a woman with praiseworthy qualities, to Nandi Seth. ||69||
While he was in the womb, many signs of his gaining the kingdom, such as the
fall of the fort, etc., began to appear in the places of the kings. ||70||
Knowing this through various means that he would be a great man in the future,
the kings started serving him with respect from birth onwards, through excellent
messengers and things sent by them. ||71|| He increased the rati, i.e., the love
of all people, therefore, the king named Rativardhan, who had a meaningful name,
came to be. Such a king that even Indu, the ruler of Kaushambi, bowed to him.

## The Eighty-Seventh Chapter  Thus, the Western brother, having attained great
power, became intoxicated with pride and forgot his past. His elder brother, the
Eastern one, having performed great deeds of righteousness, passed away and
attained the state of a celestial being.  ||73||  In his previous birth, the
Western brother had requested the Eastern one, who was then a celestial being,
to enlighten him if he were to become a human and the Eastern one a celestial
being. Remembering this request, the Eastern one's soul, in the form of a
Tullika, entered the house of the celestial being Rativardhan to enlighten him.
However, the guards at the door drove him away.  ||74||  Then, in a moment, the
celestial being assumed the form of Rativardhan and drove the real Rativardhan
away into the forest, making him appear like a madman.  ||75||  Approaching him,
the celestial being said, "You have disrespected me. Now tell me, what is your
state?" ||76||  Having said this, the celestial being revealed the truth of his
previous birth to Rativardhan, causing him to attain enlightenment and become a
right-seeing soul.  ||77||  Similarly, Nandi Seth and others also became right-
seeing souls.  ||77||  Thereafter, King Rativardhan, having taken the vows of
renunciation, attained the end of his life cycle and was reborn in the same
celestial realm where his elder brother, the Eastern one, resided.  ||78||  From
there, both celestial beings were reborn as the sons of the king of Vijay Nagar,
named Urva and Urvas.  ||78||  Subsequently, both brothers, having embraced the
religion established by the Jina, became celestial beings once again.  ||79||
From there, they were reborn as the celestial rulers, Indrajeet and Meghavahan.
||79||  And the wife of Nandi Seth, Indramukhi, having been reborn in a
different birth cycle, became your mother, Mandodari, due to her affection and
devotion to the Jina's religion.  ||80||  Having heard of these various births,
you have abandoned your attachment to worldly things and, with great fervor,
have taken the vows of renunciation.  ||81||

In the Padma Purana, There are great and vast emotions in the Kumhbhshruti
Marichavana. Those who have abandoned the Kshaya and Raga are situated in the
supreme Shramanya. ||2|| Like grass, they have abandoned the celestial realm and
are situated in the practice of Sudharma by the law. These sages, endowed with
many kinds of attainments, wander about this earth. ||3|| They are to be known
as the great sages, worthy of worship by the Bhavyas, who are bound by the
supreme penance in the Tirtha created by the Muni Suvrata. ||4|| Mandodari, who
was burning with the fire of grief caused by the separation from her husband and
sons, became extremely distraught with great sorrow. ||85|| Having regained
consciousness, she fell into a state of great sorrow, like a cuckoo, and cried
out. ||86|| "Alas, my son Indrajit! Why did you do this? Alas, Meghavahana! Why
did you not care for your grieving mother?" ||87|| "Was it right for you to do
this, neglecting your mother who was consumed by intense grief? What work have
you done with such great sorrow?" ||88|| "O my sons! You are endowed with divine
enjoyments. Now, devoid of the power of knowledge, how will you lie on the harsh
earth, having abandoned your bodies and the love for them?" ||89|| Then, looking
at the fear, Mandodari said, "Alas, father! What have you done by abandoning the
supreme enjoyments? Tell me, how did you abandon your love for your children at
once?" ||90|| "Father, husband, and son are the only means of protection for
women. Having been abandoned by all of them, whom shall I take refuge in, being
devoid of merit?" ||91||

## The Eighty-Seventh Chapter  **The Compassionate One, shedding tears like a
torrential downpour, was brought to realization by the noble Aryika,
Shashikanta, with her excellent words.** (12)  **O foolish one! Why do you weep?
In this timeless cycle of existence, you have been born into various species,
from the animal kingdom to the human realm. You have wept profusely, your mind
overwhelmed by the separation from countless loved ones. Why do you embrace
sorrow again? Embrace your true nature and attain peace.** (13)  **Having
received enlightenment from the captivating words of Aryika Shashikanta, who was
dedicated to revealing the nature of the world, Mandodari, the bearer of
excellent qualities, embraced a powerful awakening. She shed all the trappings
of her householder life, becoming completely immersed in pure Dharma, adorned in
a single white garment.** (14)  **Having attained the supreme enlightenment,
Chandrakha, Ravana's sister, also took refuge in this noble Aryika, becoming a
pure Shraman, a widow of vows, filled with intense devotion. Forty-eight
thousand women, with noble hearts, embraced the supreme restraint, their
radiance equaling that of the sun.** (15)  **Thus ends the Eighty-Seventh
Chapter, titled "The Initiation of Indrajit and Others," in the Padma Purana,
narrated by the sage Ravisha, as per the teachings of the Acharya.** (18)  **I,
a sinner, have been abandoned by all. Where can I turn for refuge?** (61)  **In
this way, Mandodari, who was overwhelmed with grief and weeping ceaselessly, was
brought to realization by the noble Aryika, Shashikanta, with her excellent
words.** (2)  **The Aryika explained, "O foolish one! Why do you weep in vain?
In this timeless cycle of existence, you have been born into various species,
from the animal kingdom to the human realm. You have wept profusely, your mind
overwhelmed by the separation from countless loved ones. Why do you embrace
sorrow again? Embrace your true nature and attain peace."** (63)  **Thereafter,
Mandodari, the bearer of excellent qualities, having received enlightenment from
the captivating words of Aryika Shashikanta, who was dedicated to revealing the
nature of the world, embraced a powerful awakening. She shed all the trappings
of her householder life, becoming completely immersed in pure Dharma, adorned in
a single white garment.** (64)  **Chandrakha, Ravana's sister, also took refuge
in this noble Aryika, having received the three supreme jewels, becoming a pure
Shraman, a widow of vows, filled with intense devotion. Gautama Swami says, "O
Shrenik! On the day Mandodari and others took initiation, forty-eight thousand
women, with noble hearts, embraced the supreme restraint, their radiance
equaling that of the sun."** (65)  **Thus ends the Eighty-Seventh Chapter,
titled "The Initiation of Indrajit and Others," in the Padma Purana, narrated by
the sage Ravisha, as per the teachings of the Acharya.** (8)  **1. Thus ends the
Padma Purana, the chapter on the initiation of Indrajit and others.**

The One-and-Eighty-Ninth Chapter  Then, the story of the great fortune of Padma-
Nabha and Lakshmana, the kings, entering Lanka, is to be told. ||1||  With a
multitude of great aerial vehicles, with the sound of the bells of the
elephants, with the best groups of horses, and with chariots like palaces, ||2||
With the echoes of the groves, which had deafened the directions, and with the
delightful sounds of musical instruments, mixed with the sound of conch shells,
||3||  With the great wheel of the Vidyadharas, the two, the best of the radiant
ones, like Indra, entered Lanka, the abode of the goddess of strength. ||4||
Seeing them, the people were filled with great joy, and they considered it the
great fruit of the virtue accumulated in past lives. ||5||  When Bala-deva, with
his chariot, arrived on the royal road, the business of the city people went
somewhere else, as it were. ||6||  The balconies, covered with the faces of
women whose eyes were blooming, were continuously adorned, as if with blue
lotuses and red lotuses. ||7||  In the observation of those who were agitated
with great curiosity, such beautiful words came out of the mouths of those
women. ||8||  "Friend, look, this is Rama, the king, the son of Dasharatha, who
is adorned with his excellent beauty, like a heap of jewels." ||9||  "He is like
the full moon, his eyes are like lotuses, and he is a creation of extraordinary
deeds, worthy of praise." ||10||  "The girl who obtains this excellent husband
is blessed, and that beautiful woman has established a pillar of her fame in the
world." ||11||  "She who has practiced the highest virtue for a long time in
past lives, obtains such a husband. What other excellent woman can obtain such a
lord?" ||12||  "The woman who receives his help at night is, as it were, the
crown of women. What is the use of another woman?" ||13||  "The blessed Janaki
has surely fallen from heaven, who, like Sachi, the wife of Indra, delights in
this praiseworthy husband." ||14||  Then, Gautam Swami said to King Shrenik, "O
King! Now, Rama and Lakshmana have entered Lanka with great splendor, so you
should tell the story of that." ||1||

The One-and-Eighty-Fourth Chapter  **15.**  Behold, Lakshmana, adorned with the
discus in his hand, who vanquished Ravana, the Asura king, in the forefront of
the battlefield.  **16.**  His dark complexion, tinged with the brilliance of
Rama's white radiance, and resembling the shade of ground-up collyrium,
possesses a splendor that rivals the vast beauty of Prayaga.  **17.**  This is
the son of Chandra, the king Viradha, who, through the power of righteous
conduct, has attained immense wealth.  **18.**  This is Sugriva, the king of
Kishkindha, a man of noble character, upon whom Rama has bestowed his supreme
love.  **19.**  This is Bharata, the brother of Janaki, adorned with a halo of
light, who was brought to this position by the celestial being, Chandra.
**20.**  Behold, this is Angada, the valiant son, a formidable warrior, who was
ready to thwart the Asura king.  **21.**  Look, my friend, at this magnificent
chariot, so beautiful, with elephants yoked to it, their trumpeting echoing like
thunder in the wind.  **22.**  This is Maruti, the son of Pavan, whose banner,
marked with the symbol of a monkey, instilled fear in the hearts of his enemies
on the battlefield.  **23.**  Thus, praised with diverse words, and possessing
immense strength, Rama and his companions, led by Padma, entered the royal road
with ease.  **24.**  Then, Rama, his heart overflowing with love, addressed the
woman standing near him, holding a fly whisk, with utmost respect.  **25.**
"Tell me, where in this land does Bharata's sister reside, she who has endured
unbearable sorrow in my absence?"  **26.**  The woman, her arms adorned with the
brilliance of jeweled bangles, and eager to please her master, extended her
finger and said,  **27.**  "My lord, look at that mountain, which stands before
you, its laughter echoing through the waterfalls, and its slopes covered with
flowers. It is called Pushpa-Preekarna.  **28.**  In its garden, resembling the
Nandana forest, resides your beloved, Janaki, surrounded by her family, renowned
for their virtue and fame."  **29.**  Then, a close friend of Sita, a woman who
always brought joy, adorned with a ring on her finger, spoke.

Padmapurane This parasol, whose appearance is like the waters of the moon's orb,
and who wears earrings that shine like the sun and moon, and whose necklace
resembles the color of the rainy season, is the most excellent among men, the
great fortunate one. (30)  Grieving intensely due to separation from you, O
beautiful-faced one, he comes like the lord of elephants, Padma, to gaze upon
the lotus-like face. (32)  Seeing the lotus-like face of her lord, Janaki (Sita)
thought she had regained a long-lost dream, and became sorrowful again. (33)
Rising up hastily from the lord of elephants, the lotus-eyed one, filled with
excitement, embraced Sita, radiating joy. (34)  Just as the moon, emerging from
the mass of clouds, delighted Rohini, so did the wielder of the plow-weapon,
descending from the elephant, delight Vaidehi (Sita). (35)  Knowing that her
lord had arrived, the great-souled Sita, distressed like a doe, arose hurriedly.
(36)  Her hair was grayed by the dust of the earth, her body was soiled, her
lips were withered like faded Banduka flowers, by nature she was slender, and
separation had made her even more so. Yet, she had a slight uplift due to the
sight of him. (37-38)  She seemed to be embracing him with the affectionate rays
emanating from her hands, sprinkling him as it were with the rippling currents
of her wide-open eyes, anointing him as it were with the sudden growth of her
beauty, and fanning him as it were with the joyous exhalations that issued
forth. (39-40)  Her broad hips provided a resting place for the eyes, her lotus-
like hands had conquered the beauty of Shri's hands, she was the protector of
righteousness born of the jewel of good fortune, her face was as full as the
moon and free from blemish. (41-42)  She was endowed with great steadfastness,
from her face-moon had arisen the expanded lotus-like eyes, she was free from
impurity, her bosom was lofty, and she was devoid of the crookedness of Cupid.

||58||  Translation:  The eighty-ninth chapter Seeing the invincible Vaidehi
(Sita) approaching somewhat near, Sri Rama attained a certain indescribable
state of mind. With humility, the beautiful Sita, agitated with longing, stood
before him. She appeared like Shachi (Indrani) by the side of Indra, like Rati
by the side of the Flowery-Arrowed (Kamadeva), like Ahimsa by the side of the
Lord of Bharata, and like Subhadra by the side of Bharatadhiraja. Seeing her
after a long time, Padma (Rama) realized that this was a new union, obtained
through hundreds of desires and bowed down by the weight of their fruits.
Bearing in his heart the trembling born of the nature of their long separation,
the handsome one with great splendor, with his eyes restless in shyness,
embraced her with his arms adorned with armlets, which had become plump in an
instant. Whether he was dissolved in her embrace, or immersed in the ocean of
bliss, or had entered his heart again out of fear of separation - this cannot be
said. Attached to his dear neck with her arms, she appeared like a golden
creeper clinging to a wish-fulfilling tree. Due to the extreme happiness arising
from their union, the comparison of this couple reached the highest level of a
couple. Seeing the well-arranged meeting of Sita and Sri Rama, the gods in the
sky showered flowers. The gods on the mountain tops, releasing fragrant water
accompanied by buzzing bees, uttered the words "Bhāritī". Oh, the incomparable
courage of the virtuous-minded Sita! Oh, her profundity and imperturbability!
Oh, her lovely character! Oh, the firmness of her vows! Oh, her lofty spirit, by
which even Ravana was not desired by her pure conduct. Meanwhile, Lakshmana,
bewildered, stood before the feet of Vaidehi with a humble and bowed form.

In the Padma Purana, seeing Chakradhara, who was like Purandara in radiance,
Sadhvi Janaki embraced him with tears of affection in her eyes. ||56|| She said,
"O Bhadra! As the great Jnanadharas, the Shramanas, have said, so have you
attained a high position." ||58|| "You have become worthy of the Chakra-marked
kingdom of Narayana. Indeed, the words spoken by the Nirgrantha sages never go
in vain." ||61|| "This is your elder brother, Baldeva, who has come. He has
shown great kindness to me, who was consumed by the fire of separation." ||62||
Then, Udu-natha, radiant like the sun, arrived, adorned with the Bhamandala,
near his sister. ||63|| Seeing him, Sita, filled with joy and brotherly
affection, embraced the victorious warrior who had returned from the
battlefield. ||64|| Sugriva, the son of Vayu, Hanuman, Nala, Nila, Angada,
Viradhit, Chandraabha, Sushena, the powerful Jambavan, Jimuta, Shalyadeva, and
other great Kecharaas, having heard their names, bowed their heads to Sita.
||65-66|| With joy, they offered beautiful unguents, clothes, ornaments, and
fragrant garlands of Parijata and other flowers, near Sita's lotus-like feet,
standing in vessels made of gold and other precious metals. ||67-68|| Then, they
all said, "O Devi! You are the embodiment of noble qualities, your influence is
renowned throughout the world, and you have attained the highest, beautiful
position through great wealth and virtuous qualities." ||69|| "You are the
embodiment of the virtues praised by the Devas, you are happy, your body is
auspicious, you are the embodiment of victory, you are the bearer of great
deeds, O Devi! May you live long with Baldeva, radiant like the sun." ||70||
Thus ends the eighty-ninth chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the Arsha,
narrated by Ravishena Acharya, which describes the arrival of Sita. ||71|| 1.
Nila-Angada, etc. ||2. This is a mistake, it should be "Jeyam" instead of
"Yeyam".

The Ashititam Parva  Then, with the sun-lit lotus face of Sita in his hand, Rama
arose.  He mounted the elephant, like Airavata, that followed his will.  The
great-souled Rama, bearing the radiance of the Samanas, rode upon the elephant-
cloud, whose bells rang sweetly.  Behind him, like the moon, shone Janaki, the
Rohini, upon the elephant's back.  With a mind fixed in meditation, he bore a
great joy, surrounded by a vast throng of people, and a great wealth of
possessions.  He was followed by celestial beings, filled with love, and
accompanied by Lakshmana, the wielder of the discus, who shone with a brilliant
light.  Rama, the wise, reached the palace of Ravana, like the chariot of the
sun, and entered it.  There, in the midst of the house, he saw the most
beautiful temple of Shantinath.  It was of a suitable size and height, built
with a thousand pillars of gold, and possessed a great radiance.  The walls were
adorned with various jewels, and it was a delight to the mind.  It stood in the
middle of Videha, resembling Mount Meru, and shone like the foam of the ocean of
milk, captivating the eyes.  It was adorned with a network of tinkling bells and
large flags, and was filled with beautiful forms, impossible to describe.  Then,
Rama, who was as powerful as a king of elephants, with clear eyes and
accompanied by the great Lakshmi, descended from the elephant and entered the
temple with Sita.  Then, with his arms hanging down, his heart at peace, Rama,
having taken the Samayika vow, joined his two lotus-like hands with Sita, and
recited the hymn of Shantinath, which destroys sin and increases merit.

In the Padma Purana, It is said that when He was born, peace spread everywhere,
destroying all diseases and enhancing brilliance. ||14|| Indra, filled with joy
and devotion, came to the peak of Mount Meru and anointed Him, whose seat
trembled and who was adorned with the highest virtues. ||15|| As a king, He
conquered the external enemies with the external chakra, and as a sage, He
conquered the internal enemies with the chakra of meditation. ||16|| He
destroyed the Asura of worldly existence, which is fickle due to birth, old age,
death, and fear-inducing weapons, and attained the auspicious abode of
liberation. ||17|| He attained the kingdom of Nirvana, which is unparalleled,
eternal, pure, based on the soul, and extremely difficult to attain. ||18||
Salutations to You, O Shantinatha, the cause of peace in the three worlds, the
great Lord, who has attained infinite peace. ||19|| You are the Lord of all
beings, both mobile and immobile, and are extremely affectionate, a refuge, the
ultimate protector, and the giver of the light of samadhi and the three jewels.
||20|| You are the Guru, the friend, the guide, and the Supreme Lord, worshipped
by the gods of the four Nikayas, including Indra. ||21|| You are the creator of
the Dharma-tirtha, through which the worthy beings effortlessly attain the
supreme abode, liberation, which frees them from all suffering. ||22||
Salutations to You, the God of gods, salutations to You, the doer of auspicious
deeds, salutations to You, the one who has accomplished everything, salutations
to You, the one who has attained everything. ||23|| O Lord, be pleased and grant
us the supreme abode of liberation, which is eternally situated in the nature of
great peace, free from all faults, and the highest. ||24|| Thus, reciting this
hymn, Kamalayatlochan and Shrirāma, who was skilled in virtuous deeds,
circumambulated the Shantināth Jina three times. ||25|| Sītā, whose body was
humble, who was eager to recite hymns, and whose hands were joined in prayer,
stood behind Shrirāma, filled with devotion. ||26|| 1. "He who conquered the
enemies with the fearsome chakra, and as a king, conquered all the kings, He,
the great one, conquered the difficult chakra of delusion with the chakra of
samadhi." - Brihatsvayambhustotra, by Swami Samantabhadra. ||27|| 2. "The Asura
of worldly existence..." ||28|| 3. "He who did not attain..." ||29|| 4.
"Disturbed..." ||30|| 5. "Us..." ||31||

The Chapter of Sorrow  Rama's voice, like the roar of a great drum, was very
harsh, while Sita's voice, like the sound of a vina, was very soft. ||27||
Then, Lakshmana, Sugriva, the radiant one, and the sons of the wind, along with
others, were all intent on chanting auspicious hymns. ||28||  Those who had
folded their hands and had their minds fixed on the Jina, were blessed, and at
that time, they seemed to be wearing lotus buds. ||26||  As they released the
beautiful sound of their mridangas, the clever peacocks danced, fearing the
sound of thunder. ||30||  Having offered praise and prostrations repeatedly,
those with pure hearts sat down comfortably in the courtyard of the Jina's
abode. ||31||  As long as they continued their salutations, King Vibhishana
comforted his relatives, Samali, Malyavan, Ratnashrava, and others, who were
suffering greatly. Vibhishana was very skilled in explaining the impermanence of
the world. ||32-33||  He said, "O noble ones! O father! Creatures in the world
experience the fruits of their own actions, so it is futile to grieve. Focus
your minds on your own welfare." ||34||  "You are all seers of the Agamas, with
vast hearts and discerning minds. Therefore, you know whether a being born will
attain death or not." ||35||  "Youth, which is difficult to describe, is like
the beauty of a flower. Life is like the splendor of a leaf, and it is as
fleeting as lightning." ||36||  "The association of relatives is like a water
bubble, pleasures are like the redness of twilight, and actions are like the
actions of a dream." ||37||  "If these beings did not attain death, how could
Ravana have come from another existence into your lineage?" ||38||  "When even
we ourselves are destined to perish one day, why engage in this foolish grief?"
||39||  "This is how it is," that is, to perish is its very nature.
Contemplating the nature of the world in this way is enough to destroy the
sorrow of the virtuous in an instant. ||40||  The words spoken, experienced, and
seen by good friends, along with the deeds of the virtuous, only cause momentary
sorrow. ||41||

6 Padma Purana The one who is separated from his relatives, he is bound to be
afflicted with grief, which is like a huge force that destroys memory. ||42||
Even though I am wandering in this endless cycle of birth and death, I should
consider that everyone is my relative in this world and hide my grief. ||43||
Therefore, with all your strength, devote your mind and soul to the teachings of
the Jinas, who are the destroyers of the cycle of birth and death, for your own
benefit. ||44|| With such sweet and heart-touching words, Vibhishana comforted
everyone and then went home. ||45|| He sent his queen, Vidagdha, who was the
most intelligent among a thousand women and was skilled in all matters, to Rama.
||46|| Vidagdha, who knew the proper etiquette, approached Rama and Lakshmana
with Sita and paid her respects to them. Then she said, "O Lord! Please consider
our master's house as your own and purify it with the touch of your feet."
||47-48|| While this conversation was taking place, Vibhishana himself arrived
with great respect. ||49|| As soon as he arrived, he said, "Rise, let us go home
and be happy." Thus, at Vibhishana's request, Rama, along with his followers,
prepared to go to his house. ||50|| The royal road was decorated continuously,
and they rode on various vehicles, including elephants as tall as clouds, horses
as swift as waves, and chariots adorned like palaces, in an orderly procession
towards Vibhishana's house. ||51-52|| The sound of trumpets arose, as loud as
the roar of clouds during the deluge, mixed with the sound of millions of conch
shells, echoing in the caves. ||53|| The sky was filled with the sound of
various musical instruments, including bhambha, bheri, mridanga, thousands of
patha, lampaka, kahala, dhundhu, dundubhi, jhanjh, amlatak, dhakka, haika,
gunja, hukar, and sunda. ||54-55|| The sound of halhala, loud laughter, and the
noise of various vehicles made the directions deaf. ||56|| The things that have
been experienced and seen, only cause a moment of sorrow in the minds of good
men, not more. ||41|| The one who is separated from his relatives, he is bound
to be afflicted with grief, which is like a huge force that destroys memory.
||42|| Even though I am wandering in this endless cycle of birth and death, I
should consider that everyone is my relative in this world and hide my grief.

## The Glorious Festival  Some were riding on the backs of lions, some on the
backs of tigers, and some were setting out in chariots, led by the celestial
lords. ||57|| They were accompanied by dancers, actors, and jesters, performing
beautiful dances, and by groups of bards singing their praises in loud voices.
||58|| Their banners, adorned with the brilliance of the full moon, and their
armies, armed with various weapons, eclipsed the sun's rays. ||56|| They arrived
at the palace of Vibhishana, their faces blooming like lotus flowers, bringing
joy to the divine women. ||60|| Their radiance, marked by auspicious signs, was
a wonder even to the gods. ||61|| Descending from their elephant, honored with
offerings of jewels, Rama and Lakshmana, accompanied by Sita, entered the
beautiful palace of Vibhishana. ||62|| In the center of this grand palace,
adorned with jeweled arches, stood the temple of Padma Prabha Jinendra, shining
like gold, surrounded by beautiful palaces, situated in the heart of the Shesh
mountain, resembling Mount Mandara, supported by a thousand golden pillars,
resplendent, with a suitable height and breadth, adorned with various jewels,
adorned with various kinds of beautiful balconies, shining like the moon,
adorned with pearl nets hanging from the windows, filled with many wonders,
beautiful with various regions like Prati Sara, and a destroyer of evil.
||63-67|| In this magnificent temple, the unparalleled image of Padma Prabha
Jinendra, made of ruby, was enshrined, illuminating the jeweled earth with the
brilliance of lotus flowers. Having praised and worshipped the image, they sat
down in their designated places. ||68-69|| Then, the celestial lords, carrying
Rama and Lakshmana in their hearts, went to their designated places, as
arranged. ||70||  Then, the celestial women, separately, began the ritual of
bathing for Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita. ||71||

In the Padma Purana, They were anointed with fragrant, beneficial, and beautiful
oils. They were also given a massage with fragrant and body-friendly substances.
||72|| Those who were seated on the bathing platforms, facing east, were blessed
with a auspicious bath. Their bath was performed in a systematic and orderly
manner. ||73|| Their bodies were rubbed, water was poured, and all this was done
in rhythm with the music, which was captivating and accompanied by all kinds of
instruments. ||74|| Their bath was completed with pitchers made of gold,
emerald, diamond, crystal, and sapphire, filled with fragrant water. ||75||
After bathing thoroughly, they wore pure clothes, adorned their bodies with
exquisite ornaments, and then entered the temple and worshipped Padma Prabha
Jinendra. ||76|| The story of the food prepared for them is very extensive. At
that time, ponds were filled with ghee, milk, yogurt, and other things, and
mountains of the finest edible substances were created, meaning that large
mounds of food were piled up like mountains. ||77|| All the things that were
desirable for the mind, smell, and eyes, which were produced in the sandalwood
forests, were brought and collected in the dining area. ||78|| The food was
naturally sweet, but what can be said about it when Janaki was present? How can
one describe the state of Sri Rama's mind at that time? ||79|| Gautama Swami
says, "O Shrenik! The five senses are only meaningful when they experience
satisfaction upon encountering desirable objects." ||80|| This creature has
eaten, smelled, touched, seen, and heard only when it has experienced the
presence of its beloved. Meaning: In the absence of a beloved, acts like eating,
etc., seem pointless. ||81|| In separation, even a place like heaven seems like
hell, and in the presence of a beloved, even a great forest seems like heaven.
||82|| They all completed their meal with beautiful, wondrous, and multi-colored
substances related to alchemy, and various types of food. ||83|| Those who were
seated on the ground in their proper places, who were honored, and who were
accompanied by their families, were fed. ||84|| -rrrraman

All the Vidhyadhara kings, who were accompanied by their beloved ones, were
served food.  ||4|| They were all adorned with sandalwood and other fragrances,
and with flowers from the forests of Bhadrashala, where bees had made their
nests. ||85|| They were all dressed in soft, light, and finely woven clothes,
and their bodies were adorned with jewels that illuminated the directions. They
were all honored, their desires fulfilled, and they were entertained day and
night with various stories. ||86|| Oh, what a jewel Vibhishana is to the
Rakshasa clan! He has followed the path of Rama and Lakshmana. ||8|| This great
soul is worthy of praise, for he has attained the highest position in the world.
What can be said about the glory of the house where Rama and Lakshmana reside,
having achieved their purpose? ||86|| Thus, all the Vidhyadharas, who were eager
to acquire the qualities found in Vibhishana, and who were free from envy,
resided happily in his house. ||60|| At that time, all the people of the city
were engrossed in the stories of Rama, Lakshmana, Sita, and Vibhishana, and they
had abandoned all other stories. ||6||  Then, Vibhishana and all the other
Vidhyadhara kings, who had attained the position of Baldeva, and who were
adorned with the auspicious marks of Rama, and Lakshmana, who had attained the
position of Narayana and who were adorned with the jewel of the Chakra, were
eager to perform their coronation. They came with humility. ||62-63|| Then Rama
and Lakshmana said, "First, our father Dasharatha had crowned our brother
Bharata as king, and he is residing in Ayodhya. He is your master and ours."
||64|| In response, Vibhishana and the others said, "As you say, it is indeed
so. But what fault can be found in this auspicious coronation, which is being
performed by great men? There is none." ||65|| "King Bharata will surely accept
this honor that you are bestowing upon him, for he is known to be very patient
and wise. He does not even entertain a thought of any kind of disturbance."
||66|| "Indeed, because of their attainment of the positions of Baldeva and
Chakravarti, they have been honored with many kinds of worship." ||17|| Thus,
Rama and Lakshmana, having attained the highest fortune, resided in Lanka, like
the gods in heaven. ||8||

1. In the city of Padmapurana, which is like the city of Indra, the Vidyadharas
lived happily on the banks of the rivers and lakes.   2. They were adorned with
divine ornaments, betel leaves, clothes, garlands, and perfumes. They sported
there with their wives, just like the celestial beings.  3. Seeing the lotus-
like face of Vaidehi (Sita), Rama was not satisfied.   4. Rama, along with his
beloved Rama (Sita), enjoyed blissfully on those enchanting lands without any
interruption.  5. Likewise, Narayana (Krishna), who had attained all desired
objects, engaged in amorous play with the beautiful Vishalya.  6. Though they
sometimes thought "we will go tomorrow", the supreme love of Vibhishana and
others made them forget this intention.  7. The years of enjoyment of love and
sensual pleasures by Rama and Lakshmana passed like a single day, so much they
were absorbed in happiness.  8. Then, remembering the beautiful characteristics
of Lakshmana, he sent Viradhi to the cities of Kubera and others.  9. That
highly accomplished Viradhi, being an expert in all rituals, went and showed the
signs to the princesses, one by one.  10. Filled with joy from this good news,
and with the permission of their parents, those princesses came there with their
suitable entourage.  11. Among them were the beautiful daughter of the lord of
Dasanga city, the daughter of Valikhilya, the lord of Kubera's city, and the
daughter of the king of Prithvipura.  12. Also, the famous daughter of the king
of Kshemanjalapura, named Jitapadma, came there.  13. These princesses from
cities like Ujjayini had attained such an excellent husband due to the merit
accumulated in their past lives.

## The Chapter of the Most Auspicious  **Verse 113:** Gautama Swami says, "O
Shrenik! Such a husband cannot be obtained without performing the highest
austerities, which are characterized by self-control (dam), charity (dan),
compassion (daya), good conduct (sheela), and are performed with the Guru as a
witness."  **Verse 114:** "A woman who has not eaten after sunset, who has never
blamed an Aryika, and who has not been insulted by a Digambar Muni, is the one
who obtains such a husband."  **Verse 115:** "Narayana was worthy of them all,
and they were all worthy of Narayana. Therefore, Narayana and those women
partook of the nectar of sexual union."  **Verse 116:** "O Shrenik! Neither the
wealth, nor the beauty, nor the playfulness, nor the art that was not present in
Lakshmana and those women of his, what is the point of talking about others?"
**Verse 117:** "Looking at their faces, one should say, 'What is a lotus? What
is the moon?' And looking at those women, one should say, 'What is Lakshmi? What
is Rati?'"  **Verse 118:** "Seeing that wealth of Lakshmana and Rama, the
Vidhyadharas were filled with wonder."  **Verse 119:** "Here, it seems
appropriate to describe the story of the union of the daughters of
Chandravardhana and the joyful announcement of their marriage."  **Verse 120:**
"At that time, the marriage ceremony took place, which brought together Sri Rama
and all the daughters of Chandravardhana, and it was a source of supreme joy for
all."  **Verse 121:** "Rama and Lakshmana, who were blessed with happiness
through their connection with great pleasures as they desired, were engaged in
play with their wives in Lanka, like Indra and his consort."  **Verse 122:**
"Six years passed in Lanka for Sri Rama, whose entire sensory faculties were
under the control of Sita's body."  **Verse 123:** "At that time, Ramachandra,
the possessor of excellent qualities, was so immersed in the ocean of happiness
that everything else was forgotten from his memory."  **Verse 124:** Gautama
Swami says, "O Shrenik! Let this story be, now listen with a focused mind to
another story that destroys sin."  **Verse 125:** "Then, the great sage
Indrajit, the destroyer of all sins, adorned with many powers, began to roam the
earth."  **Verse 126:** "He, born with the wind of detachment (vairagya) and the
garment of right faith (samyakdarshan), consumed the terrible forest of karma
with the fire of meditation (dhyana)."  **Verse 127:** "He obtained the most
auspicious husband."  **Notes:**  * **Aryika:** A Jain nun. * **Digambar Muni:**
A Jain monk who wears no clothes. * **Samyakdarshan:** Right faith, one of the
four pillars of Jainism. * **Vairagya:** Detachment, one of the four pillars of
Jainism. * **Dhyana:** Meditation, one of the four pillars of Jainism. *
**Karma:** The law of action and reaction, a central concept in Jainism.

The Padma Purana 2 Even though he was the chariot-bearer of the clouds, the fire
of worldly desires was extinguished for him by the attainment of perfect
knowledge, and he attained the nature of the soul. || 128 || After them, the

conduct, became pure of soul due to the influence of white karma, and he
attained the state of a sage who hears the sound of the pot. || 126 || Seeing

The Darkest Chapter  Maricha attained the state of a Kalpavaasi, and other great
sages also attained their respective fruits according to their deeds. ||143||
Behold the greatness of Vaidehi, born of firm vows. How she maintained her
virtue and banished her enemies. ||144|| Sita's unparalleled patience, beautiful
form, auspicious intellect, and loving bond with her husband are all
unparalleled. ||145|| By virtue, she was destined for heaven, content with her
husband. Sita adorned the character of Ramadeva. ||146|| Even women can attain
heaven through the jewel of a vow, free from other men. ||147|| Even May, who
was fierce in his delusion and killed many beings, attained the state of a
Vitaraga, controlled his sinful tendencies, and became a great sage. ||148||
The king Shrenik said, "O Lord! I have heard the greatness of Indrajit and
others. Now I wish to hear the greatness of May." ||149|| "O Lord! There have
been other virtuous women on this earth who were devoted to their husbands. Did
they also attain heaven?" ||150||  The Ganadhar said, "If they were like Sita in
their determination and vows, devoted to their husbands, and endowed with many
virtues, then they surely went to heaven." ||151|| "O King! Those whose souls
are unwavering in experiencing the fruits of good and bad deeds, that is, those
who experience the fruits of their past good and bad deeds with equanimity, all
such virtuous women are equal in their actions." ||152|| "O King! There is a
great difference between vines, horses, elephants, iron, stone, trees, clothes,
women, and men." ||153|| "Just as not every vine bears cucumbers and pumpkins,
so too, O King, not all women possess good character." ||154|| "There was a
woman named Abhimāna, born of a noble lineage, who claimed to be a pativrata,
but in reality, she was devoid of the control of virtue and attained the state
of a wicked beast." ||155||

## Chapter 104 of the Padma Purana  **156.** This mind, like an elephant, cannot
be controlled by the weak goad of worldly scriptures. Therefore, it leads the
being to evil.  **157.** Only through the teachings of the omniscient, with
compassion and happiness as its path, can the mind, like an elephant, be guided
by the wise and virtuous being.  **158.** Listen, I will briefly describe the
character of pride, a story passed down through generations of wise people.
**159.** In a time when the entire country was afflicted by a disease-ridden
wind, a Brahmin from Dhanagramam left his village with his wife.  **160.** The
Brahmin's name was Nodana, and his wife's name was Abhimāna. Abhimāna was born
to a woman named Māninī, who was the daughter of Agni, and she possessed immense
pride.  **161.** Driven by hunger, with his soul distraught, Nodana abandoned
Abhimāna. Gradually, Abhimāna reached the forest of elephants, where she found
King Kararuha as her husband.  **162.** King Kararuha was the ruler of
Pushpaprakirna Nagar. Later, Abhimāna, who had gained her husband's favor,
struck King Kararuha on the head with her foot during their lovemaking.
**163.** The next morning, when the king was seated in his court, he asked the
learned scholars, "What should be done to the one who strikes the king's head
with their foot?"  **164.** Hearing the king's question, many of the courtiers,
who considered themselves learned, said, "His foot should be cut off, or he
should be deprived of his life."  **165.** In the same court, a Brahmin named
Hemāṅka, who knew the king's intentions, said, "O King, his foot should be
worshipped with the utmost respect, adorned with ornaments, and honored."
**166.** The king asked him, "How did you become so wise? How did you know the
truth?" He replied, "The weapon of the beloved woman's teeth has shown her
beloved the wound inflicted by her. I have understood the whole mystery by
seeing the woman's teeth mark on your lips."  **167.** Hearing this, the king
thought, "This one knows the true meaning." He bestowed great wealth upon
Hemāṅka and granted him his favor.  **168.** In Hemāṅka's house, a woman named
Mitrayashā, the beloved of Bhārgawa, who was known as Amoghashara, lived.
**Note:** The text uses the Jain terms "Jina" (Omniscient), "Bhavya" (Virtuous),
and "Samyaktva" (Right Faith).

The Tale of the Dark Fort 105  The widowed and sorrowful woman lived in that
house and taught her son, remembering the virtues of her husband. ||168||  See,
son, the influence of Hemaṅka, the sage, who, with a calm mind, acquired
knowledge in his childhood. ||170|| You are the son of such a father, who, with
his knowledge of archery, surpassed all the Brāhmaṇas, or even Parśurāma.
||171||  Hearing his mother's words, his eyes filled with tears, Śrīvardhita,
the proud boy, comforted his mother and immediately went to learn. ||172||
Then, in the city of Vyāghrapura, he learned all the arts in the house of his
teacher and, having abducted the daughter of King Sukānta, he fled from there.
||173|| The daughter's name was Śīlā, and her brother's name was Simhendu, a
warrior of great strength, who set out to bring back his sister. ||174|| But
Śrīvardhita had become so skilled in weapons that he defeated Simhendu, who was
accompanied by an army, in battle. He returned home, met his mother, and
attained supreme joy. ||175|| Śrīvardhita was a great scholar, and his fame
gradually spread. Therefore, King Kararuha gave him the kingdom of the city of
Podanapura. ||176||  When King Sukānta of Vyāghrapura died, his enemy, Tināma,
attacked his son, Simhendu. Fearing for his life, Simhendu fled his home with
his wife through a tunnel. ||177|| He was very frightened and, deeply
distressed, went to his sister for refuge. On the way, he met some betel-
sellers, and carrying their load on his head, he reached the vicinity of
Podanapura with his wife after sunset. There, the king's soldiers captured him
and threatened him. Somehow, he escaped and, terrified, entered the forest.
||178-179|| There, a great serpent bit him. His wife, weeping, carried him on
her shoulder to the place where Mayamuni resided. ||180|| Mayamuni, the bearer
of great mountains, stood motionless like a pillar in the forest, in the posture
of a statue. The queen then...

In the Padma Purana, The muni's feet touched the stone, and Simhendu was
revived. ||12|| Having paid homage to the Caitya with devotion, Kesari Chandra,
along with his beloved, bowed repeatedly to the muni. ||18|| As the sun rose,
the muni's observance ended. Vinayadatta, the devotee, arrived to pay his
respects. ||18|| The disciple, having received the message, went to the city and
informed Srivardhita that Simhendu had arrived. Hearing this, Srivardhita
prepared for battle. ||185|| Then, having been informed of the truth,
Srivardhita, with a joyful heart, went to his brother-in-law, eager to show him
honor. ||186|| Then, having met with his loved ones, and filled with joy,
Srivardhita, bowing respectfully, asked the seated Muni Maya, "O Bhagavan, I
wish to know my past birth and that of my family." Then the virtuous Muni spoke
as follows: ||187-188|| In the city of Shobhapura, there was a Digambara Muni
named Bhadracharya. The king of that city was Amal, adorned with a multitude of
virtues. ||189|| Amal, with a noble heart, went to serve the Acharya every day.
One day, while going, he encountered an unbearable stench. ||160|| The stench,
emanating from the body of a leper, was so terrible that the king could not bear
it and quickly walked home. ||161|| That leper woman had come from another place
and stayed near the temple. The stench was coming from her wounds. ||162|| She
took the Anuvrata from Bhadracharya and, after dying, went to the celestial
world. From there, she was reborn as your wife, Sheela. ||163|| The king Amal,
having entrusted all his royal duties to his son, was pleased with the eight
great vows and became a Shravaka. ||164|| Simhendu was laid near his feet.
||181|| Simhendu, touching the feet of the Muni, touched the body of his wife,
which revived her. ||182|| After that, Simhendu paid homage to the image with
devotion, and then, along with his wife, bowed repeatedly to the Muni. ||183||
Then, as the sun rose, the Muni's observance ended. At that time, Vinayadatta,
the devotee, arrived to pay his respects. ||184|| The disciple, having received

The eighth chapter, Having fallen from the heaven world, he became Srivardhit.
Now I will tell you about your mother's previous birth. ||135|| Once, a
foreigner, suffering from hunger, wandered into a village. Not getting food in
the village's eating house, he became angry and said in a harsh voice, "I will
burn the whole village." As fate would have it, a fire broke out in the village
at that very moment. ||166-167|| The villagers, enraged, brought him and threw
him into the fire. He died a painful death and became a cook in the king's
palace. ||168|| After that, he died and went to hell, suffering terrible
torment. From there, he was reborn as your mother, Mitrayasha. ||136|| In
Podanpur, there was a great householder named Govanij. His wife's name was
Bhujapatra. Govanij died and became Simhendu, and Bhujapatra became his wife,
named Rativardhani. In their previous birth, they had burdened donkeys and other
animals with heavy loads, causing them pain. Therefore, they had to carry the
burden of being tamboli (betel leaf sellers). ||200-201|| Saying this, May Muni
Raja, illuminating the sky, went to his desired place. Srivardhit also went to
the city, meeting his relatives. ||202|| Gautam Swami says, "O King! In this
strange world, due to the rise of past karma, some attain a kingdom, while
others lose their acquired kingdom. ||203|| Even after attaining the company of
a Guru and Dharma, the path of a being is different due to death with or without
a cause. ||204|| Some, filled with jewels and happiness, cross the ocean. Some
sink in the middle, and some die on the shore. ||205|| Knowing this, wise people
should always work for the welfare of their soul through compassion, self-
control, purification of austerities, humility, and the study of scriptures.
||206|| O King! At that time, hearing the words of May Muni Raja, the entire
Podanpur was pacified, and the king's mind became calm." ||207|| He became a
Shravak, content with eight villages. ||164|| In the end, he went to heaven and
from there became Srivardhit. Saying this, May Muni Raja said, "Now I will tell
you about your mother's previous birth." ||15||

||12||  Translation:  In the eighty-first chapter, Kaushalya, who was like the
goddess of wealth residing in the abode of Brahma, and who was the elder sister
of Lakshmana, was lamenting the separation from her son Rama, who was like the
lord Indra with the moon-like crest. She was distressed, her body scorched by
the flames of separation from her beloved son and husband. How could she have
forgotten the unconquerable mother? ||1-2||  Ascending to the seventh floor of
the palace, surrounded by her companions, she was anxious, her eyes filled with
tears, like a newly calved cow longing for her calf. ||3|| Gazing in all
directions, intent on her son's love, she was lamenting intensely, immersed in
the ocean of sorrow, desiring to see him. ||4|| Standing on the peak of the
flag, she called out to the crow, saying, "O crow, if my son Rama comes, I will
give you a dish of milk-pudding." ||5|| After speaking thus and contemplating
her charming gestures, when she received no response from him, the maker of
cloudy days (Kaushalya) began to lament with tears flowing from her eyes. ||6||
"Alas, my child! Where have you gone? You were always lovingly nurtured. What
new fondness for wandering in foreign lands has arisen in you?" ||7|| "Even if
you are experiencing the pain of your tender leaves (feet) on the harsh path,
where will you rest, overcome by the intense fatigue of the dense forest?" ||8||
"Alas, abandoning me, the most unfortunate one, immersed in extreme sorrow, with
which hope have you gone, accompanied by your brother Lakshmana?" ||9||  As she
was lamenting in this manner, the divine sage Narada, who roams the celestial
regions, arrived there. ||10|| Wearing matted locks, his form covered in white
garments, renowned for his excellent qualities, Narada was renowned throughout
the earth. ||11|| Seeing him approach, the unconquered Kaushalya rose and
respectfully welcomed him with a seat and other hospitality. ||12||

110 Padmapurana Seeing Siddhayoga Muni with tearful eyes and heavy sorrow
evident in his very form, Narada asked, "O Kalyani, from whom have you received
this disrespect, causing you to weep? The reason for your sorrow is not
apparent." ||13-14|| You are the well-known daughter of the great king,
praiseworthy, and the wife of Dasharatha, known as Aparajita. ||15|| You are the
mother of the jewel among men, Shri Rama, blessed with excellent qualities, and
worthy of respect like a deity. The wicked one who has angered you, will be
punished by the mighty King Dasharatha, who encompasses the entire world with
his prowess, and will take his life today. ||16-17|| In response, Devi Kausalya
said, "O Devarsha, you have arrived after a long time, hence you are unaware of
this news and are speaking thus." ||18|| "It seems you have become someone else,
and your cruelty has increased, otherwise why does your old affection appear so
weak?" ||19|| "Why have you not received this news even till now? It seems you
are fond of traveling and have just arrived from somewhere far away." ||20||
Narada said, "In the eastern region of the Dhaataki Khand-island, there is a
city called Surendra-Raman, where the Tirthankara Bhagwan was born." ||21||
"Indra, along with the gods and demons, performed his birth ceremony on Mount
Sumeru with wondrous divine splendor." ||22|| "I witnessed that abhisheka of the
Tirthankara Bhagwan, who destroys all sins and promotes virtuous deeds." ||23||
"The gods, filled with joy, danced in celebration, and the Vidyadharas adorned
themselves with radiant splendor." ||24|| "Engrossed in the vision of the
Jinenadra, I resided happily on that extremely captivating island for twenty-
three years." ||25|| "However, remembering this Bharat-kshetra, which is like a
mother to me, and the great patience it has instilled in me, I have returned
here after a long time." ||26|| "Having arrived in the Bharat-kshetra of
Jambudvipa, I have not gone anywhere else, and have come directly to see you,
thirsty for knowledge of the news." ||27|| Aadar Kiya ||12||

The Eighty-First Chapter  Then Aparajita (Kausalya) narrated the entire incident
to Narada. She said that the Acharya, the well-wisher of all beings, arrived
with his Sangha. The king of the Maha-Vidyaadharas, Bhamandala, met him. King
Dasharatha took the vows of renunciation along with many kings. Rama, along with
Sita and Lakshmana, went to the forest. There, he was separated from Sita and
met Sugriva and others. In the battle, the lord of Lanka, Ravana, struck
Lakshmana with his weapon. The daughter of Drona-Megha, Vishalya, was taken
there quickly. ||28-31||  Hearing this, Kausalya, who was overwhelmed with
grief, started weeping again. ||32||  "Alas! Alas! My son, where have you gone?
Where are you? It has been a long time. Come soon, give me your word, talk to
me, and console me who is drowning in the ocean of sorrow." ||33||  "O virtuous
son! I, who am devoid of merit, cannot see your face. I am consumed by the fire
of intense sorrow and consider my life meaningless." ||34||  "The princess,
Sita, who was raised with care and is as innocent as a forest deer, must be
suffering in the enemy's prison." ||35||  "The cruel Dasha-Asya (Ravana) has
wounded Lakshmana with his weapon. There is no news whether he is alive or not."
||36||  "Alas! My son, who is so rare! Alas! My virtuous daughter Sita! How have
you come to experience this terrible sorrow in the middle of the ocean?" ||37||
Knowing this news, Narada threw his Veena on the ground and sat down with his
hands on his head, filled with anxiety. ||38||  His body became motionless for a
moment. After thinking deeply and looking at her many times, he said, "O Devi!
This matter does not seem right to me." ||39||  "Ravana is the lord of three
continents, extremely angry, and the master of all Vidyaadharas. Why has he
angered Bhamandala and Sugriva?" ||40||  "However, O Kausalya! O auspicious one!
Do not grieve excessively. I will go and bring you news soon. There is no doubt
about it." ||41||  "O Devi! I have the ability to do this much. Your son is
capable of doing the rest." ||42||  Making this promise, Narada, holding his
Veena close to him like a dear friend, ascended into the sky. ||43||

In the Padma Purana,  Seeing the earth with its swift winds and the difficult-
to-see mountains, Narada, bewildered, went towards Lanka.  Approaching Lanka, he
thought, "How can I know the news without any means?"  If I ask Dashavaktra
directly about Rama and Lakshmana, it will be considered a fault. What should I
do? No clear path is visible.  Or, I will know the desired news in this way.
Thinking this, he went towards Panasarovar with a calm mind.  At that time,
Angada, adorned with excellent beauty, was playing with his inner palace.  Going
there, Narada, with sweet words, stood for a moment asking a man standing on the
shore about Ravana's well-being.  Hearing his words, the servants, with
trembling lips, became angry and said, "O ascetic! Why are you speaking such
wicked words?"  "From where did you, a wicked ascetic, come to the group of
Ravana?" Saying this, they surrounded him and took him to Angada.  When the
servants told Angada, "This ascetic is asking about Ravana's well-being," Narada
replied, "I have no work with Ravana."  Then the servants said, "If this is
true, then why are you happy and showing great respect in asking about Ravana's
well-being?"  Then Angada laughed and said, "Take this deceitful, foolish
ascetic and quickly show him to Padma-naabha."  Being pushed from behind by
those eager to pull his arms, Narada, being taken with difficulty, thought,
"There are many men on this earth who are called Padma-naabha. I don't know
which one is the one I am being taken to."  May some goddess, who has affection
for the Jain teachings, protect me, I have fallen into great doubt.  1.

The One Hundred and Thirty-First Chapter. 113 Narada, whose breath was at the
end of his life, and who was trembling greatly, entered the house of Vibhishana,
which was shaped like a good cave. ||58|| Seeing Rama from afar, his mind filled
with sudden joy, Narada, drenched in sweat, cried out, "Oh, what injustice!"
||59|| Hearing his cry, Rama looked at him and recognized him as Avadvara
Narada. At that moment, he said to his servants with respect, "Release him,
release him quickly." Then, the servants, who had immediately released him, went
to Rama and stood before him, filled with joy. ||60-61|| Narada, whose fear had
vanished, sat down on a comfortable seat, having greeted Rama and Lakshmana with
auspicious blessings. ||62|| Then Rama said, "You are Avadvara-Gati, a small
person. Where are you coming from?" In response, Narada said in order: ||63|| "I
have come from your mother, who is submerged in the ocean of sorrow, to bring
you news of her condition at the feet of your lotus-like feet." ||64|| "Your
mother, the victorious goddess, the worthy and divine Aparajita Devi, is in
great distress without you. She washes her face with tears day and night."
||65|| "Just as a lioness is distressed without her cub, so is she distressed
without you. Her hair is disheveled, and she rolls on the ground." ||66|| "Oh,
Lord! She cries so much that even stones would soften at that moment." ||67||
"How can that mother, who is worthy of praise, a bearer of great virtues, and
devoted to her son, be in distress while you, her virtuous son, are alive?"
||68|| "If you do not soon see your mother, who is withered by the sun of your
separation, I believe that her life will end today." ||69|| "Be pleased, go,
rise, and see your mother. Why are you sitting? In truth, in this world, a
mother is the greatest friend." ||70|| "The same thing is happening to Kaikeyi
and Sumitra, who are also suffering. She has made the floor of the palace into a
small pond by shedding tears." ||71|| "There is no desire for food, sleep,
night, or day in her mind. Her well-being is only possible by your separation."

chest and head with both hands. ||73|| "Alas, Lakshmana, my son! Come, revive
your mother, speak quickly!" Thus, she continuously laments. ||74|| Grant peace
to both mothers, whose bodies are consumed by the flames of the intense fire of
separation from their sons, with the nectar-like stream of your darshan. ||75||
Hearing this, Rama and Lakshmana, both brothers, were deeply saddened, tears
flowing from their eyes. Then, the celestial beings comforted them. ||76||
Having somehow regained his composure, Rama said, "Oh, sage! You have done us a
great favor." ||77|| "Due to the rise of bad karma, our mother had been
forgotten by us. You have reminded us of her. What could be more dear than
this?" ||78|| "In this world, that man is blessed who is devoted to his mother's
wishes and, having attained the status of a servant, serves her." ||79|| Thus,
with his heart overflowing with the nectar of maternal love, King Ramachandra,
along with Lakshmana, greatly honored Narada. ||80|| With a very troubled mind,
he called Vibhishana and, in the presence of Sugriva and the radiant sun, spoke
as follows: "Oh Vibhishana! In this abode of yours, which is like the palace of
Indra, a great deal of time has passed without our knowledge." ||81-82|| "Just
as a man, scorched by the rays of the summer sun, always has a desire for a cool
lake, so too, although the desire to see our mother has been in our hearts for a
long time, today, merely remembering that separation, my entire body is burning
with intense heat. Therefore, I wish to grant her complete peace with the water
of seeing her." ||83-84|| "Today, my mind is very eager to see Ayodhya, for it
reminds me of my other mother." ||85||  Then, Vibhishana said, "Oh, master! Do
as you wish. Your heart's desire will be fulfilled. May peace be upon you, my
lord." ||86||

The Eighty-First Chapter  The messengers are sent to the city to convey the good
news. The mothers will be happy to know of your arrival. ||87|| O Lord, O
compassionate to the dependent, be pleased to stay in this city for sixteen
days. ||88|| Saying this, Vibhishana placed his head, adorned with a gem, at the
feet of Rama and remained there until he was accepted. ||89|| Then, Aparajita,
standing on the roof of the palace, always facing the south, saw the celestial
beings from afar and spoke to Kaikeyi, who was standing nearby. ||90|| Look,
look, Kaikeyi, those celestial beings are coming from a great distance,
resembling clouds driven by the wind. ||91|| They must be sent by my son, along
with his younger brother, and they will surely tell us good news today. ||92||
Kaikeyi said, "As you say, it will be so." While they were talking, the
celestial messengers arrived nearby. ||93|| Showering flowers, they descended
from the sky, entered the palace, introduced themselves, and went to Bharata,
filled with joy. ||94|| King Bharata, overjoyed, honored them, blessed them, and
seated them on suitable seats. ||95|| Those celestial messengers, with beautiful
minds, told the whole story as it happened. They said that Rama had attained the
position of Baldeva, Lakshmana had obtained the jewel of the chakra, and they
had both attained the position of Narayana. ||96|| Rama and Lakshmana both have
obtained the supreme ownership of the Bharata region. ||97|| Ravana, wounded by
Lakshmana in battle, has attained the five elements. Indrajit and others, who
were in the prison, have taken initiation. ||98|| Garuda, pleased by the removal
of the obstacles of the country-adorning and family-adorning sages, has bestowed
upon Rama and Lakshmana the knowledge of the lion-chariot and the Garuda-
chariot. ||99|| Great love has arisen for Vibhishana, he has obtained the best
of wealth and possessions, and he has entered Lanka. ||100|| Thus, the king,
delighted by the news of the rise of Rama and Lakshmana, honored the messengers
with garlands, betel nut, and fragrant substances. ||101|| 1. Suvatsala: M. 2.

---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, Bharata, taking those Vidhyadharas, went to his mothers.
They, filled with sorrow and tears, were comforted by them. ||101|| The
beautiful story of Rama-Lakshmana's mothers and the Vidhyadhar messengers, which
gladdens the mind and announces their glory, continued. Meanwhile, thousands of
swift chariots, filled with gold and jewels, blocked the path of the sun.
Thousands of Vidhyadharas, resembling colorful clouds, arrived, just as the
mighty gods arrive at the time of the Jina's descent. ||102-104|| Then, those
Vidhyadharas, stationed in the sky, showered a rain of various jewels,
illuminating the directions with their brilliance. ||105|| When Ayodhya was
filled, in every family's house, there were piles of gold and other riches, like
mountains. ||106|| It seemed that the inhabitants of Ayodhya had performed
virtuous deeds in past lives, or had come down from heaven, for they had
attained such prosperity at that time. ||107|| At that time, Bharata had this
proclamation made in the city: "Whoever is not satisfied with jewels and gold,
let that man or woman, without fear, enter the royal palace and fill their house
with wealth as they desire." ||108-109|| Hearing this proclamation, the people
of Ayodhya came and said, "There is no empty space left in our houses." ||110||
Women, whose lotus-like faces were blooming from the contact of the sun of
wonder, and whose poverty had been destroyed, were praising Rama. ||111|| At
that time, many skilled Vidhyadhar artisans came and coated the floors of the
houses with silver and gold. ||112|| They built many beautiful Jina temples and
large, magnificent palaces, as high as the peaks of the Vindhyachal mountains.
||113|| They constructed various mandapas, supported by thousands of pillars,
adorned with strings of pearls, and decorated with various statues. ||114|| They
filled the doorways with large jewels, shining with rays, and erected groups of
toranas, adorned with rows of flags. ||115|| Thus, Ayodhya, filled with many
wonders and celebrating a grand festival, became like Lanka, the conqueror.

## Eighty-first Chapter  The city of Ayodhya, destined to conquer Lanka, was
filled with wonders and continuous festivals.    **117.**  On the peaks of the
Mahendra mountains, there were countless temples where abhisheka (consecration)
festivals were celebrated with continuous music.  **118.**  Gardens, adorned
with the finest flowers and fruits, were filled with the buzzing of bees and the
sound of rain-laden clouds.  **119.**  Surrounded by beautiful forests, teeming
with joyful creatures, the city resembled the divine Nandana forest.  **120.**
The city was nine yojanas wide, twelve yojanas long, and thirty-eight yojanas in
circumference.  **121.**  Skilled celestial architects, working for sixteen
days, created such a magnificent city that even a hundred years would not be
enough to praise it.  **122.**  The city was adorned with ponds, lined with
golden steps, and canals with beautiful banks.  These were filled with lotus
flowers and other aquatic plants, and even in the summer, they never dried up.
**123.**  The canals, perfect for bathing and playing, were adorned with
magnificent Jain temples on their banks and surrounded by rows of trees.  They
presented a magnificent sight.  **124.**  Recognizing Ayodhya as a city equal to
heaven, the chariot driver, Halaka, announced the departure of the expedition
throughout the city.  **125.**  Gautama Swami said, "O Shrenika!  Since the time
Narada Muni, who roams the celestial sky, informed them of the news about their
mothers, Rama and Lakshmana have always held their mothers in their hearts."
**126.**  All the unimaginable things in the world become beautiful due to the
influence of good deeds done in past lives.  Therefore, all beings should always
strive to accumulate good deeds, so that they do not have to suffer the
scorching heat of the sun of worry.  **8.**  Thus ends the eighty-first chapter
of the Padma Purana, known as the "Aarya" (venerable) and narrated by the
Acharya Ravishena, which describes the city of Ayodhya.  **Notes:**  *
**Yojana:** An ancient Indian unit of distance, approximately 8-10 miles. *
**Abhisheka:** A ceremony of consecration, often performed for kings and
deities. * **Nandana:** A mythical garden in heaven. * **Shrenika:** A king
mentioned in the Jain scriptures. * **Narada Muni:** A celestial sage known for
his wisdom and travels. * **Halaka:** The chariot driver of Rama. * **Aarya:** A
term of respect, often used for scriptures and teachers. * **Acharya:** A
spiritual teacher or master. * **Ravishena:** A Jain Acharya who is credited
with writing the Padma Purana.

## The Two-Cooled Festival  **1.**  On the auspicious day, Rama and Lakshmana,
the bearers of auspicious deeds, ascended the Pushpaka chariot and departed for
Ayodhya.  **2.**  The lords of the Vidyadharas, eager to serve them, set out
with their families, mounted on various chariots and vehicles.  **3.**  From the
sky, where the sun's rays were blocked by umbrellas and flags, they looked down
upon the earth adorned with mountains.  **4.**  They crossed the ocean of salt,
where groups of various creatures were playing, and continued their journey,
filled with joy, carrying out their playful activities.  **5.**  Sita, the
virtuous lady, adorned with virtues, sat beside Rama. She shone with great
splendor, like Lakshmi herself. Looking ahead, she said to Rama, "Oh Lord! What
is this extremely bright object in the middle of Jambudvipa?"  **6.**  Then Rama
addressed the beautiful Sita, "Oh Devi! This is the same place where, in his
childhood, the Lord of Lords, Munisuvrata, was anointed by the gods, filled with
joy."  **7.**  "This is the renowned Mandara, the king of mountains, adorned
with towering, jeweled peaks, which are pleasing to the eyes."  **8.**  "Oh! Due
to our speed, the chariot has deviated from its path. Let us go back to the
army." Saying this, Rama went back to the army and said, "My dear, this is the
Dandaka forest, where the darkness of the clouds of black elephants prevails,
and where Ravana, your enemy, abducted you."  **9.**  "Oh beautiful one! This is
the river where you and I performed the Parana for two Charana Munis, who
possessed the power of Riddhi."  **10.**  "Oh Sulochana! This is the mountain
called Vanshasthavil, where we saw the Munis, the adornment of the land and the
family, together."  **11.**  "I, you, and Lakshmana served those Munis, removing
their afflictions, and they attained the knowledge of liberation, which brings
the bliss of Shiva."  **12.**  "Oh Bhadra! This is the city of Valikhilya, where
Lakshmana obtained the daughter named Kalyanamala, who is equal to you."

The City of Dasangabhoga 16 Beloved, the city of Dasangabhoga is visible, where
the father of the beautiful woman, Vajrashrava, a great Shravaka, resides.
||15|| Looking again at the earth, Janaki asked again, "Beloved, whose celestial
king's city is this?" ||16|| It is filled with magnificent buildings like
vimanas, and I have never seen such a city that mocks heaven. ||17|| Hearing
Janaki's words and looking at the directions slowly, Rama's mind was confused
for a moment. But knowing everything, he smiled softly and said, "Beloved, this
is Ayodhya. It seems that celestial artisans have created it in such a way that
it looks like another city, it has conquered Lanka and is filled with excellent
radiance." ||18-16|| Then, suddenly seeing a vimana shining like a second sun,
situated in the middle of the sky, the city was filled with excitement. ||20||
Filled with excitement, Bharata, mounted on a great elephant, adorned with great
splendor, came out of the city like Indra. ||21|| At that time, he saw all
directions covered with celestial beings, situated in various vehicles and
vimanas, and endowed with extraordinary powers. ||22|| Seeing Bharata
approaching, Rama and Lakshmana, who had brought the Pushpaka vimana down to
earth, approached with joy. ||23|| Seeing them both nearby, Bharata dismounted
from the elephant and worshipped them with hundreds of offerings, filled with
love and respect. ||24|| Then, emerging from the top of the vimana, both elder
brothers, adorned with armlets, embraced Bharata with great love. ||25|| Seeing
each other and inquiring about their well-being, Rama and Lakshmana, along with
Bharata, boarded the Pushpaka vimana again. ||26|| Then, everyone entered the
city of Ayodhya, which was decorated and adorned with various flags, in an
orderly manner. ||27|| The path was filled with vehicles, vimanas, chariots, and
many flags, all moving with great speed. ||28|| Where did Lakshmana obtain a
wonderful girl named Kalyanamala, similar to you? ||14||

In the Padma Purana, The sounds of trumpets, drums, and cymbals arose, Mixed
with the roar of millions of conch shells, And the mighty sounds of bhambha and
bheri drums. ||26|| The resounding beat of large drums, The deep tones of
mridangas, The vibrant sounds of lamps and dhandhus, All were incredibly sweet.
||30|| The mighty sounds of jhallar, amlatak, hakka, and gunja-ratit
instruments, Accompanied by the roar of haik instruments, The indistinct and
sweet sounds of kahalas, The dense sounds of halhala, The sounds of laughter,
The sounds of horses, elephants, lions, and tigers, The melodies following the
sound of flutes, The various songs, The loud sounds of vessels, The recitations
of prisoners, The delightful sounds of chariots, The radiant light of the sun,
The sounds of the earth shaking, And millions of echoes, All these sounds
combined to create a grand symphony. ||31-34|| Thus, adorned with supreme
splendor, The Vidyaadhara kings, Surrounded Rama and Lakshmana, Who possessed
beautiful bodies, As they entered the city. ||35|| At that time, the Vidyaadhara
gods were present, Rama and Lakshmana were like Indra, And Ayodhya was like
heaven. How can one describe such a scene? ||36|| The ocean of the world, Which
made sweet sounds, Beheld the moon-like face of Rama, And grew in size with the
passing time. ||37|| The men who recognized them, Honored them at every step,
And showered blessings upon them, Saying, "Victory to you, grow, live, and
prosper." ||38|| The women, Standing on the peaks of their lofty, sky-like
mansions, Their lotus-like eyes blooming, Gazed upon Rama and Lakshmana. ||39||
They were eager to see Rama, Whose eyes were like lotus petals, And whose
complexion was like the full moon, And Lakshmana, Whose complexion was like a
rain cloud, And who possessed beautiful features. ||40|| Leaving all other tasks
aside, They transformed their windows into lotus gardens, With their faces, So
that they could see them. ||41|| O King! At that time, When the women were in
close proximity to each other, Their necklaces broke, And their breasts, Like
clouds, Poured forth a rain of milk. ||42|| The paths of Ayodhya were filled
with crowds of chariots, horses, elephants, and flying machines. ||28|| The
sound of trumpets, like the roar of thunderclouds, mingled with the sound of
millions of conch shells, and the mighty sounds of bhambha and bheri drums.
||26|| The resounding beat of large drums, the deep tones of mridangas, the

The festival of Dwadasheetitam was over. The women's mekhalas, nu-pur, and
kundalas were falling to the ground, and they were talking amongst themselves.
Some were saying, "This is Rama, the one who has the virtuous Sita, the daughter
of King Janaka, in his lap, the one who has large eyes."   Others were saying,
"Yes, this is the same Rama who killed the wicked Sahasagati, the grandson of
the demon king Vritra, who was a thief of Sugriva's form."   Some were saying,
"This is Lakshmana, who has the strength of Indra, who killed Ravana in battle
by striking him in the chest with his chakra."   Some were saying, "This is the
mighty Sugriva, this is his son Angada, and this is Bhammandala, the brother of
Sita Devi, who was taken away by the gods at birth, then released out of
compassion and seen by the Vidyaadhara Chandragati."   "Not only that, but he
was brought to the forest in joy and given to Queen Pushyavati, saying, 'This is
your son.' This is the Vidyaadhara king Bhammandala, whose face is illuminated
by his divine jeweled kundalas, and who is known by the name Sार्थक. He is
shining brightly."   "Oh friend, this is Viradhit, the son of Chandrodara, and
this is Shrishaila (Hanuman), the son of Pavana, who carries the banner with the
monkey emblem."   Thus, the women of the city, filled with wonder and joy, saw
these people of great beauty arrive at the royal palace.   By the time they
reached the palace, the two valiant mothers, who were on the roof of the palace,
who were full of love for their sons, and whose breasts were full of milk, came
down from above.   The great-souled, virtuous, undefeated Kaushalya, Kaikeyi
(Sumitra), Kekaya (Bharata's mother), and Suप्रजा (Suप्रभा), who were skilled in
auspicious conduct, came together near Rama and Lakshmana, as if they had met by
chance in a previous life.   Then, Rama and Lakshmana, who were happy to see
their mothers, whose eyes were like lotuses, and who were as radiant as the
guardians of the world, descended from the Pushpaka Vimana.

## Padma Purana 6 With folded hands and bowed heads, the two princes, along with
all the kings and their consorts, approached their mothers and paid their
respects. ||57|| The mothers showered them with thousands of blessings and
auspicious gifts. The princes embraced their mothers, experiencing an
immeasurable joy. ||58|| They embraced them again and again, never satiated, and
kissed their foreheads, their trembling hands touching them. Their eyes
overflowed with tears of joy. ||59|| They sat down, inquired about each other's
well-being, and attained supreme fortitude. ||60|| Gautama Swami said, "O
Shrenik! Their thousands of desires, multiplied countless times in the past,
have now borne fruit, exceeding their expectations, due to the power of their
merit." ||61|| These noble mothers, devoted to the virtuous, with pure minds,
surrounded by hundreds of daughters-in-law, and possessing the wealth of
Lakshmi, attained unparalleled glory and respect through the influence of their
valiant sons and their own accumulated merit. ||62-63|| They ruled the earth,
extending from the salt sea to the horizon, unopposed, granting commands as they
pleased, adorned with a single umbrella. ||64|| Gautama Swami said, "Whoever,
with a pure mind, hears or reads this account of the auspicious reunion, will
attain desired wealth, a long life, and great merit." ||65|| Even a single rule
followed by a person of good intellect leads to progress and shines brightly
like the sun. Therefore, O noble ones, follow this rule. ||66|| Thus ends the
Vyasiṣṭha Parva, the eighty-second chapter of the Padma Purana, narrated by the
venerable Raviṣena Acharya, known as the Ārṣa. ||82||

The Triyasititama Festival  Again bowing his head, the king Shrenika asked the
sage, "O venerable one, how was the wealth and prosperity in the house of Rama
and Lakshmana?" ||3||  Gautama said, "O king, although the pleasures of Rama,
Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna cannot be fully described, yet, O king, I
will tell you in brief about the wealth that arose due to the influence of
Balabhadra and Narayana. Listen." ||2-3||  Their dwelling, called Nandyaavarta,
was like the abode of Indra, beautiful, with many gates and high gopuras. ||4||
There was a fort called Chatuhshala, as high as the peaks of a great mountain,
and a hall called Vaijayanti. There was a beautiful hall called Suvithi, made of
moonstone, and a very high prasadakuta, overlooking all directions. There was a
viewing hall called Vardhamana, as high as the Vindhya mountain, and offices
equipped with various tools. Their inner sanctum was as wondrous as a hen's egg,
standing on a single pillar, and as beautiful as a Kalpavriksha. ||5||
Surrounding this inner sanctum was a row of palaces belonging to the queens,
known as Tarangali, shining with jewels. ||6||  There was a bedroom called
Ambhojakanda, with the brilliance of lightning, a beautiful, soft-touch bed,
resting on lion-head feet. There was a magnificent throne, like the rising sun,
and fans like clusters of moonbeams. ||10-11||  There was a large, heavy
umbrella, radiating the brilliance of the moon, providing shade as desired.
There were two sandals called Vishamochika, for comfortable walking. ||12||
There were priceless garments, divine ornaments, an impenetrable armor, a pair
of shining jeweled earrings, unfailing maces, swords, gold, discs, arrows, and
other great things that shone on the battlefield. ||13-14||

124 Padma Purana Fifty lakh ploughs were there, more than a crore of self-
milking cows. ||15|| The number of families residing in Ayodhya, who were
holders of immense wealth and constantly engaged in righteousness, was slightly
more than seventy crore. ||16|| All the houses of the householders were
extremely white, of various shapes, filled with inexhaustible treasuries and
adorned with jewels. ||17|| The outer regions of the city, filled with various
types of grains, appeared like small round mountains, and the four-storied
buildings with paved floors were extremely pleasant. ||18|| There were many
beautiful gardens, situated in the midst of excellent gardens, adorned with
various types of flowers, with excellent staircases and suitable for recreation.
||19|| The householders, adorned with groups of beautiful cows and buffaloes,
were filled with great happiness and were shining like the best gods. ||20|| The
chieftains, who were like the protectors of the people, were said to be like the
Lokapalas, and the kings, who were holders of immense brilliance, were endowed
with splendor like that of Mahendra. ||21|| There were many beautiful women,
like Apsaras, who were the land of worldly happiness, and there were many
instruments that gave happiness according to one's desires. ||22|| Just as
before, this Bharat region had attained supreme beauty through Harishena, the
king who wore the Chakra Ratna, so too this Bharat region had attained supreme
beauty through Rama. ||23|| Sri Ramadeva had built thousands of Chaityalayas,
which were constantly worshipped by the wealthy and noble people who possessed
immense wealth. ||24|| The people residing in the country, villages, cities,
forests, houses and streets, were happy and formed circles, constantly
discussing this. ||25|| Look, this entire Saketa country is now ready to attain
the status of a wondrous heaven. ||26|| In the middle of this country,
Ayodhyapuri is shining like the city of Indra, with tall buildings that are
impossible to describe. ||27|| Seeing those large schools, one wonders whether
they are the play-grounds of the gods, surrounded by brilliance, or a group of
autumn clouds. ||28|| The rampart of this city is illuminating all directions,
extremely high, like the platform of the ocean, and adorned with large peaks.

## The Most Glorious City  A city adorned with a wealth of gold and jewels, its
radiance illuminating the sky, a city whose splendor surpasses even the
imagination. Such was Ayodhya, a city unmatched in the three worlds. (30)  This
auspicious city, filled with virtuous souls, seems to have been transformed by
Ramadeva himself, surpassing all others in beauty. (31)  They say there is a
beautiful place called heaven, and it seems as if Rama and Lakshmana have
brought that heaven with them. (32)  Or perhaps this is the same ancient city of
Uttar Kosala, now inaccessible to those devoid of virtue. (33)  It seems that
Ramachandra has brought this city, along with its inhabitants, their wives,
animals, and wealth, to a state of splendor akin to heaven. (34)  There is one
major flaw in this city, a source of great shame and disgrace, something that
virtuous men would find unbearable to endure. (35)  The flaw lies in the fact
that Ravana, the king of the Vidyadharas, abducted Sita and surely enjoyed her.
Now that Sita has been brought back, is it right for Rama to accept her? (36)
People, behold! When this is the act of a Kshatriya, a noble, a wise and
honorable man, what can be said of others? (37)  Thus, the slander against Sita,
fueled by the actions of petty minds, has spread far and wide, rooted in her
past karma. (38)  Meanwhile, Bharata, residing in this city that shames heaven,
finds no joy even in the pleasures fit for Indra. (39)  Though he is the lord of
a hundred and fifty wives, he constantly harbors resentment towards the lofty
glory of his kingdom. (40)  This city is adorned with magnificent palaces, their
roofs, towers, and doorways radiating a captivating brilliance, arranged in
orderly rows. (41)  The floors are crafted from a mosaic of colorful gems, the
courtyards are beautiful, the city is adorned with garlands of pearls and gold,
and the trees are laden with blossoms. (42)  This city is filled with wonders,
captivating the senses, a place of music and dance, teeming with beautiful
women, and a haven for the intoxicated. (43)

In the Padma Purana, There was a beautiful elephant, adorned with a garland of
flowers, Whose body was fragrant with musk, and whose trumpeting was like the
neighing of horses. The place was filled with sweet music, and adorned with a
canopy of jewels, A delightful place for play, even for the gods. The king,
overwhelmed with fear of the world, Could not find courage, like a deer
frightened by a hunter. Human life, obtained with great difficulty, is fickle
like a drop of water, Youth is like a bubble, fragile and full of troubles.
Pleasures are tasteless at the end, life is like a dream, And the bond with
relatives is like the gathering of birds. He who, having realized this, does not
practice Dharma, which brings happiness, Will be consumed by sorrow in his old
age, like a withered tree. What is the use of attachment to youth, which is a
fool's beloved, A dwelling place of slander, and fleeting like the evening
light? It is necessary to abandon this body, which is a house of many diseases,
Whose root is semen and blood, what pleasure can there be in this machine? Just
as fire is not satisfied with fuel, and the ocean is not satisfied with water,
So too, this being is not satisfied with worldly pleasures, even when enjoyed.
The mind attached to desires is sinful, and does not understand anything, Like a
greedy moth, it suffers terrible pain. What pleasure can there be in these
breasts, which are like goiters, And constantly dripping with sweat, these
disgusting lumps of flesh? What beauty is there in this mouth, which is full of
teeth like insects, And stained with the red juice of betel, like a cut made by
a razor? The actions of women, born of wind-like defects, or caused by madness,
Even when called playful, what pleasure can there be in them? Music and weeping
are the same as the sound of a house, They do not differ in the mind that dwells
in courage.

The Most Auspicious Festival 12. What pleasure can a man derive from the service
of women whose bodies are defiled by impurities and who are covered only in
skin? ||5|| A foolish mind, taking two earthen pots, considers the union of the
two as a source of happiness. ||56|| How can one who is not satisfied by the
vast array of divine pleasures born of mere desire be satisfied by the paltry
pleasures of human existence? ||60|| A firewood seller does not find
satisfaction in the dew drops on blades of grass in the forest, he only finds
toil. ||61|| Similarly, the king, not satisfied with the wealth of his kingdom,
engages in such an evil act as the consumption of human flesh. ||62|| Just as
crows, greedy for flesh, enter the flowing Ganges and, while devouring the
carcass of a dead elephant, do not find satisfaction and ultimately perish in
the ocean, so too, beings of the world, not finding satisfaction in worldly
pleasures, ultimately drown in the ocean of existence. ||63|| O Atman! Your
subjects, like frogs, are trapped in the mud of delusion and are being dragged
into the hole of hell by the fierce serpent of greed. ||64|| Thus, many days
passed for the dispassionate Bharata, whose mind was peaceful, as he
contemplated the obstacles to his initiation. ||65|| Just as a lion, though
powerful, suffers in a cage, so too, Bharata, though capable of performing the
initiation rites, suffers, not having attained the Jain vows, which destroy all
suffering. ||66|| The peaceful-hearted Bharata was earnestly entreated by his
mother, Kaikeyi, to stay.  Rama and Lakshmana, filled with affection, held him
back and said, "Brother, your father, desiring your welfare, had established you
as the king of the entire earth. ||67-68|| Since your father had definitely
crowned you to rule the world, you are our master as well. Therefore, you should
rule the world." ||69|| "This Sudarshana Chakra and these Vidhyadhara kings are
at your command, so enjoy this earth as your wife." ||70|| I myself will hold
your white umbrella, and Lakshmana, the minister, will hold your fly whisk.

128 Padma Purana Even after being told this, if you do not follow my words, then
I will go to the forest today, just like a deer. 72 Having conquered Ravana, the
jewel of the Rakshasa lineage, we have come here driven by the thirst for the
happiness of seeing you. 73 Enjoy this kingdom, free from obstacles, for now.
Later, you will enter the forest of penance with us. 74 Bharata, whose heart was
completely free from worldly desires, was eager to speak and said to Rama, who
was the possessor of a good heart: 75 O God! I wish to quickly abandon this
royal fortune, which has been abandoned by those who have attained liberation by
performing great penance. 76 O King! These desires and wealth are fickle,
obtained through suffering, served by the most foolish people, and hated by the
wise. 77 O Halayudha! Even if these perishable pleasures are like the heavenly
realm or resemble the ocean, I have no desire for them. 78 O King! I wish to
cross this ocean of the world, which is extremely terrifying, extends to the
underworld of death, is filled with waves of birth, has large waves of pleasure
and displeasure, is full of large crocodiles of attachment and aversion, and is
terrifying due to various kinds of suffering, by boarding a boat of vows. 79-80
O King! I have become weary, having experienced the unbearable suffering of
being born in various wombs, wandering repeatedly in different species. 81
Hearing these words of Bharata, the kings, whose eyes were filled with tears,
were filled with wonder and spoke with trembling voices: O King! Accept your
father's words and protect the world. If you do not like Lakshmi, then become a
sage after some time. 82-83 Bharata replied: I have fully followed my father's
words, protected the world for a long time, and honored the abundance of
pleasures. 84 I have given the supreme gift, satisfied the community of the
virtuous. Now I wish to do what my father did. 85 Why don't you all give me your
approval today? As it is, one should be connected with a worthy cause. 86 I wear
a white umbrella like the moon, Shatrughna carries a fly whisk, and Lakshmana is
your minister. 71

The most glorious festival Having conquered the enemy forces in a fierce battle
with a multitude of elephants, the Lakshmi you have earned is like that of
Nanda, Balabhadra, and Narayana.  || 87 ||  Even though it is great, it is not
capable of giving me satisfaction.  Like the Ganga, it is unable to satisfy the
ocean, so I am now turning to the path of truth. || 88 ||   Having said this,
and having asked them, Bharat, filled with intense emotion, rose from his throne
in a hurry, like Bharat Chakravarti. || 86 ||   As Bharat, with his graceful
gait, was about to leave for the forest, Lakshmana, with affection and concern,
stopped him, taking hold of his hand. || 10 ||   As Bharat, with his hand,
pushed aside Lakshmana's hand, he consoled his mother, who was shedding tears
like a river.  Meanwhile, by Rama's command, the women, whose beauty was like
Lakshmi's, arrived and wept for Bharat.  Their eyes, like lotus petals, trembled
in the wind. || 61-62 ||   In the meantime, Sita, the embodiment of Lakshmi
herself, Urvi, Bhanumati, Vishalya, Sundari, Aindri, Ratnawati, Lakshmi,
Gunavati (who bore a meaningful name), Kanta, Bandhumati, Bhadra, Kauberi,
Nalakuvara, Kalyanamala, Chandrini, Manosatsava, Manorama, Priyananda,
Chandrakala, Kalavati, Ratnastheli, Suravati, Shrikala, Gunasagara, Padmavati,
and many other women of the two brothers, whose descriptions are impossible,
arrived there. || 63-66 ||   The form of all those women was captivating, they
were adorned with divine garments and ornaments, they were the source of many
auspicious events, they were born of love, they were eager to show the fruits of
all the arts, they stood around, they were beautiful, they were eager to charm,
they had beautiful voices, and they had the radiance of a group of lotus flowers
trembling in the wind.  They all said to Bharat with great respect, || 67-69 ||
"Brother-in-law! Please grant us a great favor.  We want to play in the water
with you." || 100 ||   "O Lord! Abandon all other worries that trouble your
mind, and do what is pleasing to this group of your brother's wives." || 101 ||

In the Padma Purana, Even though all those women surrounded Bharat, his mind did
not become attached to any kind of desire. He only accepted their request out of
kindness. || 102 || After receiving the order, the wives of Rama, Lakshmana, and
Bharat became free from doubt and attained supreme joy. || 103 || Then,
surrounded by those women with beautiful movements and lotus-like eyes, Bharat
descended into the magnificent lake. || 104 || His mind was absorbed in the
contemplation of the truth, and he was indifferent to play. Bharat only entered
the water at the request of the women. || 105 || Surrounded by the women and
filled with humility, Bharat shone upon reaching the lake, like the lord of a
herd of elephants. || 106 || Three fragrant, beautiful, and smooth garments were
applied to Bharat's body, which colored the water with their vast brilliance. ||
107 || Engaged in excellent activities and extremely charming, King Bharat,
after playing a little and bathing well, emerged from the lake. || 108 ||
Bharat, who had performed a great worship of the Arhant with lotuses and blue
lotuses, was adorned by the group of those respectful women. || 109 ||
Meanwhile, the famous elephant king, Trilokamandan, who resembled a great cloud,
broke the pillar and emerged from his dwelling. At that time, he was making a
terrifying sound and showering the sky with the water of his rut. || 110 - 111
|| Hearing his roar, which was like the dense, vast roar of a cloud, the entire
city of Ayodhya became as if all its people were mad. || 112 || The city's roads
were filled with elephants, driven by mahoutas who were exhausted from running
around, their ears and eyes fixed in fear due to the pushing and shoving caused
by the crowd. || 113 || Those terrifying, rutting elephants, who could capture
the speed of horses, scattered in all ten directions as they pleased. || 114 ||
Breaking the golden and jeweled, mountain-like tower, the Trilokamandan
elephant, whose tusks were large and made of gold and jewels,

The Chapter of Deep Meditation 131  The women, their eyes filled with fear, were
gathered in great confusion. They approached Bharata for protection, just as
rays of light approach the sun. ||16|| Seeing the elephant king approaching
Bharata, the people cried out in lament, "Alas, alas!" ||17|| The mothers,
filled with great anxiety and love for their son, were deeply distressed and
bewildered. ||118|| At that time, Rama and Lakshmana, armed with cunning and
great knowledge, approached the terrified Vidhyadhara elephant drivers, ready to
seize the extremely agile elephant king by force. ||119-120|| The elephant king
roared angrily, was terrible to behold, powerful, swift, and could not be
restrained even by naga-pasas (snares). ||121||  Then, seeing the glorious
Kamalalocana Bharata standing at the end of the women, the elephant remembered
his previous life. ||122|| Overwhelmed with great anxiety, the elephant lowered
his trunk and stood before Bharata in humility. ||123|| Bharata spoke to him in
sweet words, "Oh, elephant king! Why are you filled with anger?" ||124|| Hearing
Bharata's words, the elephant regained his senses, became extremely peaceful,
his restlessness vanished, and his appearance became very gentle. ||125|| The
elephant looked at the affectionate Bharata standing before the best of women,
as if he were looking at Indra seated amidst a group of apsaras in heaven.
||126||  Then, the wise elephant, who was letting out long sighs, was filled
with this kind of anxiety, free from any disturbance. ||127|| He thought, "This
is the same one who was my best friend, a god in the Brahmottara heaven, shining
like the moon. ||128|| He has fallen from there and, due to his remaining merit,
has become a great man. Alas, I have committed a sinful act and been born in
this animal form. ||129|| I have been deprived of the ability to discern right
and wrong. How have I become an elephant? Alas, what a shame!" ||130||  Bharata
was present there, and the elephant went towards him. ||115||

## Padma Purana  **13.** Why should I grieve now, remembering the past? I will
perform actions that will benefit my soul.  **132.** Worrying is not the cause
of liberation from suffering. Therefore, I will embrace the path that leads to
liberation with full reverence.  **133.** The elephant, known as Upendravajra,
who remembered his past lives, had attained great detachment from the world. His
soul was completely turned away from sinful actions, and he was focused on
accumulating virtuous deeds. He sat peacefully before the ornament of the three
worlds, the elephant Bharata.  **134.** Gautama Swami said, "O King! The evil
deeds done in past lives cause intense suffering later. Therefore, O noble ones!
Perform virtuous deeds, for it is not right to stumble while the sun is
shining."  Thus ends the eighty-third chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the
**Tribhuvanalankarakshobha**, narrated by the sage Ravishena, which describes
the distress of the elephant, the ornament of the three worlds.  **130.** How
did this elephant become a parable? Alas, this sinful act is to be condemned!
**1.**  May it be so.

## Chapter 48  **Verse 1:** The valiant, humble, best of the two-legged,
contemplating thus, was filled with utmost wonder as he beheld the lotus-like
chakra in the hands of the elephant.  **Verse 2:** With a little strength, Rama
and Lakshmana, filled with some doubt, slowly approached and seized the
elephant, who was beloved for his sweet speech.  **Verse 3:** Having received
the command of Narayana, and with great joy, the others adorned the elephant
with all ornaments and offered him great respect.  **Verse 4:** With the great
elephant calmed, the city, freed from its anxiety, shone like the autumn season,
devoid of the dark clouds.  **Verse 5:** His extremely fierce speed could not be
stopped even by the kings of the Vidyadharas or the most powerful gods.  **Verse
6:** How was this former vehicle of Ravana, who could shake Kailasa, stopped by
Rama and Lakshmana?  **Verse 7:** Having attained such a state of tranquility
after experiencing such a transformation, it should be understood that this is
due to the merit of his past life, which brings long life.  **Verse 8:** Thus,
in the entire city, people were filled with utmost wonder, and there was a lot
of talk, with people shaking their heads and hands.  **Verse 9:** Then, along
with Sita and Vishalya, Bharat, the bearer of great fortune, mounted the
elephant and set out for home.  **Verse 10:** The remaining women, adorned with
the finest ornaments and riding various vehicles, surrounded Bharat.  **Verse
11:** Shatrughna, riding a chariot drawn by horses, filled with supreme glory,
was in front of Bharat.  **Verse 12:** The sound of the great instruments like
Kamla, Amla, and drums, mixed with the sound of conch shells, created a loud
commotion.  **Verse 13:** Just as the gods leave the Nandana forest and reach
their beautiful heaven, so too did they leave the Kusumamoda garden, filled with
the fragrance of flowers, and reach their beautiful home.  **Verse 14:** Then,
the king Bharat, with pure intellect, dismounted the elephant, entered the
dining hall, and respectfully served the sages.

##  Chapter 135 of the Pam Purana  135 Pam Purana He ate with his friends,
ministers, and brothers-in-law. Then everyone went to their respective places.
||15|| Why did the Triloka-Mandana elephant become angry? How did he become
calm? Why did he go to Bharata? What is all this? Thus, the elephant-related
stories never ceased. ||16|| Then, Gautama Swami said, "O Shrenik! All the
Mahamats came and, bowing respectfully, said to Ram and Lakshman, ||17|| "O Dev!
Oh! It has been four days since the Triloka-Mandana elephant, having abandoned
all his duties and with a weakened body, ||18|| has become calm after
experiencing agitation. From that moment, he has been absorbed in meditation.
||19|| With his eyes closed, he breathes deeply, agitated, and, after meditating
for a long time, he strikes the earth with his trunk. ||20|| Although he is
constantly praised with hundreds of sweet hymns, he does not take a bite and
does not make a sound in his ears, meaning he does not listen to anything.
||21|| With his eyes closed, he keeps his trunk on the front of his teeth,
standing still, as if he were a statue of an elephant. ||22|| Is this a fake
elephant, or is it a real Mahagajraj? Thus, people keep arguing about him.
||23|| Even if he takes a bite due to sweet words, he releases it before it
reaches his mouth, even if it is a delicious morsel. ||24|| Abandoning the play
of the three-footed elephant, he stands, filled with sorrow, leaning against a
pillar, taking a deep breath. ||25|| Even renowned physicians, whose minds are
purified by the respect of all scriptures, cannot understand his intentions.
||26|| This elephant, whose mind is fixed on something else, does not listen to
the very beautiful music composed with great care, as he did before. ||27|| Even
though he is treated with great love and affection, he does not regain his
health through auspicious rituals, amusements, yoga, mantras, knowledge, or
medicines. ||28|| Like a friend who has attained liberation, even when
requested, he does not engage in entertainment, sleep,

## The Eighty-Fourth Chapter  **The Mystery of the Elephant**  **30.** This
profound and wondrous secret, difficult to comprehend, resides in the elephant's
mind. We do not know what it is.  **31.** This elephant cannot be satisfied, nor
does it ever desire anything. It does not even experience anger, just like a
painted image.  **32.** O Lord! This elephant, with its wondrous prowess, is the
root cause of this entire kingdom. O Lord! This elephant, an ornament of the
three worlds, is like a Karati (a type of elephant).  **33.** O Lord! Having
understood this, you are the authority on this matter. We, with our limited
intellect, can only make requests.  **34.** Hearing the elephant's previous
actions, which were vastly different from its current behavior, Rama, Lakshmana,
and the king were deeply troubled for a moment.  **35.** "Why did this elephant
escape from its confinement? Why did it attain peace? And why does it not accept
food?" Thus, the sun, in the form of Rama, rose with many doubts.  **8.** Thus
ends the eighty-fourth chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the "Aarya"
(authored by the sage Ravi), which describes the peace of the elephant, an
ornament of the three worlds.  **1.** (Note: The text has a typo, "Jata" should
be "Jata".)

The Fifty-fifth Chapter  In the meantime, O King, the Kevalis, Desa-bhushan and
Kula-bhushan, arrived in Ayodhya along with many other Munis. ||1||  These Desa-
bhushan and Kula-bhushan, who had attained the four-faced image on the
Vansasthavil mountain, were subjected to an upsarga by their former enemy.  And
after being served by the valiant Rama and Lakshmana, they attained the Kevala-
jnana, which illuminates all the worlds. ||2-3||  Thereafter, Garuda-indra, who
was pleased, gave Rama and Lakshmana various kinds of jewels, weapons, and
vehicles, filled with devotion and affection. ||4||  Rama and Lakshmana, who had
attained a state of doubt in battle due to being disarmed, conquered their
enemies and obtained their kingdom by the grace of these Kevalis. ||5||  These
two Munis, Desa-bhushan and Kula-bhushan, who were praised by the Devas and
Asuras, and whose fame spread throughout the three worlds, arrived in the city
of Ayodhya, the most important of cities. ||6||  They stayed in the forest
called Mahendrodya, which was like the Nandana-vana, just as the Munis Sanjay
and Nandan had arrived earlier. ||7||  These Kevalis, accompanied by the great
assembly of Munis, were radiant like the moon and the sun, and were the bearers
of the highest good.  The people of the city became aware of their arrival.
||8||  Thereafter, Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna, eager to pay their
respects, were ready to go to the Kevalis. ||9||  When the sun rose, they
announced it throughout the city.  Then, mounted on their magnificent elephants,
with the three-world-adorning elephant, Jatismaran, leading the way, they set
out, with beautiful minds like the Devas, towards the place where the two
Kevalis, Desa-bhushan and Kula-bhushan, were seated, like mountains of
auspiciousness. ||10-11||  O Shrenik, their mothers, Kaushalya, Sumitra,
Kaikeyi, and Supraja (Suprabha), who were devoted to the Jain religion, eager to
serve the virtuous, accompanied by hundreds of female attendants, and radiant
like celestial nymphs, were also ready to go. ||12-13||

The Fifty-fifth Chapter 137 Suग्रीव and other Vidyadharas, filled with the
desire to see the Muni, arrived there, accompanied by great splendor. ||14||
Seeing the Muni's umbrella, like the full moon, they dismounted from their
elephants, starting from Padma-nabha, and came on foot. ||15|| They folded their
hands, praised the Munis, bowed down in reverence, and then sat down on the
ground, each in their respective places. ||16|| With focused minds, they
listened to the Muni's words, which destroyed the causes of the world and were
dedicated to praising Dharma. ||17|| He said, "Anu-dharma and Purna-dharma -
Anu-vrat and Maha-vrat - these two are the paths to liberation. Of these, Anu-
dharma is the cause of liberation through tradition, while Maha-dharma is said
to be the direct cause of liberation." ||18|| The first, Anu-dharma, is
extensive and practiced in the household life, while the second, Maha-dharma, is
extremely difficult and practiced only by great, heroic, and liberated souls.
||19|| In this world, without beginning or end, beings deluded by greed suffer
intense pain in hell and other lower births. ||20|| Dharma is the supreme friend
in this world, Dharma is the great benefactor. The root of Dharma is pure
compassion, and its fruit cannot be described. ||21|| By associating with
Dharma, beings obtain all their desired objects. Dharma is the most revered in
the world. Those who are imbued with the spirit of Dharma are called wise in the
world. ||22|| The Dharma that is rooted in compassion is the cause of great
welfare. That Dharma rooted in compassion does not exist in other, inferior
Dharmas of the world; it is different from them. ||23|| That Dharma rooted in
compassion, ordained by the Jina, is extremely rare and always present in the
path, by which one attains the highest state in the three worlds. ||24|| The
supreme fruit of that Dharma is enjoyed by Dharanendra and others in the
netherworld, by Chakravarti and others on earth, and by Indra and others in
heaven. ||25|| Hearing this, Lakshmana, the virtuous one, bowed his head in
reverence and asked the Muni, "O Lord! Why did the elephant king, Triloka-
mandana, break the pillar and become agitated, and why did he suddenly become
calm again?" ||26-27|| "O Bhagavan! You are worthy of removing my doubts." Then
the Kevali, the ornament of the land, spoke as follows. ||28|| 1. श्रुत्वा म० ।

138 Padmapurana He was overwhelmed with extreme agitation due to his great
strength, but remembering his past life, he attained peace. ||26|| In the
beginning of this age, which is the field of karma, he was born in the city of
Ayodhya, taking a body from the womb of Queen Marudevi and bearing the name
Uttama. He had bound the karma of a Tirthankara in his previous life, which
caused him to be famous for his greatness, like Indra. ||30-31|| He was the lord
of the earth, whose lofty breasts were the Vindhya and Hima mountains, and whose
girdle was the ocean. He always served the earth, like a devoted wife who always
pleases her husband. ||32|| He was Lord Rishabhadeva, who was worshipped by the
three worlds. He roamed in the city of Ayodhya, just as Indra roams in heaven.
||33|| He was the glorious Rishabhadeva, adorned with brilliance and radiance.
He was endowed with Lakshmi, Sri, and beauty, and was an ocean of auspicious
qualities. He possessed the three knowledges, was wise, patient, and profound.
His actions were captivating to the eyes and mind. He had a beautiful body, was
strong, and was the most powerful. ||34-35|| At the time of his birth, the gods,
led by Saudharma Indra, performed his abhisheka with golden and jeweled pots on
Mount Sumeru, filled with devotion. ||36|| Who can describe the qualities of
Rishabhadeva, whose wealth is constantly desired even by Indra? ||37|| After
enjoying the supreme wealth of Lakshmi for a very long time, he saw the apsara
Nilanjana and attained enlightenment. ||38|| The gods of the world praised him.
The great teacher of the world, Lord Rishabhadeva, who possessed great wealth,
left his home after entrusting his kingdom to his hundred sons. ||39|| Since he
went to the garden called Tilaka, renouncing all worldly desires, that garden
became known as the pilgrimage site of Prajagar in the world. ||40|| He stood
like an immovable mountain, like Mount Meru, for a thousand years, renouncing
all possessions. He performed severe austerities for a thousand years. ||41||
The four thousand kings who had taken the vow of a monk, due to their devotion
to their master, were defeated by the unbearable hardships within six months.

## The Fifty-Fifth Chapter  Those men of small resolve, who had broken their
vows and adopted self-made vows, were like the vallabhis, who, relying on the
fruits and roots, adopted the way of the vallabhis. ||43||  Among them, there
was a great man, known as Marichi, who, with a mind stained with the passions,
adopted the way of the wandering ascetics. ||44||  In the city of Suprabha,
there were two sons, Suryoday and Chandroyad, born to the queen Prahladana, who
were like great jewels. ||45||  They were renowned throughout the world. They
had taken initiation with Lord Adinath, but, corrupted by the monastic path,
they were deeply attached to each other and finally sought refuge in Marichi.
||46||  These two disciples of Marichi, who were devoted to the practice of
illusory austerities and vows, had many disciples, known as Paribangas. ||47||
Due to their practice of false religion, they wandered through the four realms
of existence. The earth was filled with the bodies they had abandoned in their
previous births. ||48||  Then, Chandroyad, under the influence of karma, was
born in the city of Naga, as the son of King Haripati and Queen Manoluta. He was
named Kulankar and became a great king. ||49||  Suryoday was born in the same
city, as the son of the learned Brahmin Vishvank and his wife Agni-kunda. He was
known as Shrutirat and became the priest of King Kulankar, due to the influence
of his past affection, which had grown over many births. ||50-51||  One day,
King Kulankar was going to serve the ascetics who had been serving his lineage
for generations. On the way, he saw some Digambar Muni-rajas. ||52||  The Muni-
rajas were named Abhinandit. They had the eye of omniscience and were benevolent
towards all beings. When King Kulankar bowed to them, they said, "O King! Where
you are going, your prosperous grandfather, who became an ascetic, has died and
become a snake. He is residing in the middle of a piece of wood. An ascetic is
splitting that wood. Go and protect him." ||53-54||  When Kulankar went there,
everything happened as the Muni-rajas had said. ||55||

In the Padma Purana,   Seeing those ascetics who had attained the state of non-
attachment, King Kalankar was inspired and desired to take the vow of a Shraman
(Jain monk). [56]  However, the Purohit (priest) named Shrutirat, who was
influenced by the false teachings of Vasu and Parvat, misled him with the
statement, "O King! The Vedic Dharma has been passed down through your lineage.
Therefore, if you are truly the son of King Haripati, then follow the Vedic
Dharma." [57-58]  "O King! For now, follow the Vedic rituals. Later, after
establishing your son on the throne, you can pursue the welfare of your soul. O
King! Be gracious to me." [59]  King Kalankar agreed, saying, "It is as you
say." His beloved queen, Shridhama, who was involved with another man, observed
this and thought, "It seems this king has discovered my infidelity and is
seeking to renounce the world. Or perhaps he will not renounce the world. Who
knows the workings of his mind? I will poison him and kill him." [60-62]  Driven
by the sin of contemplating the killing of animals, both the king and the
Purohit were reborn as rabbits in a forest called Nikunj. [63]  Then, propelled
by the force of karma, they successively took birth as a frog, a rat, a peacock,
a serpent, and a deer. [64]  The Purohit was reborn as an elephant, while King
Kalankar was reborn as a frog. The elephant crushed the frog to death with its
foot. [65]  The frog was reborn in a dry lake and was eaten by crows. He then
became a rooster, while the elephant was reborn as a cat. [66]  King Kalankar's
soul remained a rooster for three births, and the Purohit, reborn as a cat, ate
the rooster. [67]  The king and the Purohit were then reborn as a fish and a
crocodile, respectively. They were caught in a net by a fisherman and killed
with an axe. [68]  The crocodile was reborn as a...

## The Fifty-Fifth Chapter  A creature with two legs is a beast if it is devoid
of self-control and virtue. Thus, driven by the desire to learn the Vedas, Raman
left his home. [7] Wandering the earth, he studied the four Vedas with their
appendages in the houses of teachers. After completing his studies, he returned
home. [7]  Longing to see his brother, Raman arrived in the city of Rajagriha as
the sun set and darkness enveloped the sky. [72] He stayed outside the city in a
dilapidated garden, which was a shrine to the Yakshas. There, this incident
unfolded. [73]  Raman's brother, Vinod, who lived in Rajagriha, had a wife named
Samidha. This Samidha was a woman of loose morals, and she received a signal
from a king named Ashokadatta to meet him at the Yaksha shrine where Raman was
staying. [74]  Ashokadatta was apprehended by the police on his way, so he could
not reach Samidha as planned. Meanwhile, Vinod, Samidha's true husband, arrived
with a sword in hand. [75]  Hearing Raman's kind words to Samidha, Vinod,
consumed by anger, killed Raman with his sword. [76]  Afterward, Vinod, the
hidden sinner, returned home with his wife, filled with joy. They wandered the
world for a long time. [77]  Later, Vinod's soul became a buffalo in the forest,
and Raman's soul became a blind bear in the same forest. Both perished in a fire
in that Sal forest. [78]  They were then reborn as hunters in the mountain
forest, and after death, they became deer. Their parents and other relatives,
terrified, scattered in all directions. The two fawns were left alone. Their
eyes were exceptionally beautiful, so the hunters captured them alive. [79]
Meanwhile, the third Narayana king, Swayambhu, was on his way to see the
immaculate Sri Vimalnath Swami. [80]  The king Swayambhu, adorned with immense
wealth, returned after paying homage to the Jina with the gods and demons. He
saw the two fawns and, seeing the hunters, he...

142 Padmapurana He placed them in the Jain temple. || 81 || There, seeing the
monks and eating food as they wished from the royal court, both deer attained
supreme fortitude. || 82 || One of the deer, with his lifespan exhausted,
attained death through samadhi and went to heaven, while the other wandered
among the Nirya. || 83 || Then, through karma yoga, the deer named Vinod
attained the human state, as if he had received a kingdom in a dream. || 84 ||
In the city of Kampilya, in the Bharat region of Jambudvipa, there lived a
wealthy merchant named Dhanada, who had earned twenty-two crore dinars. || 85 ||
The merchant, who was the reincarnation of the deva named Raman, had a virtuous
son named Bhushan born to his wife, Varuni. || 86 || A fortune-teller told
Dhanada that his son would definitely become a monk. Hearing this, Dhanada
became anxious about the world. || 87 || Driven by love for his son, Dhanada
built a house suitable for all activities, where Bhushan resided. || 88 ||
Bhushan, served by excellent women with various clothes, food, and ointments,
performed beautiful activities there. || 89 || He never saw the rising sun or
the setting moon, nor did he ever leave the fifth section of his palace-like
mountain. || 90 || Dhanada had obtained this only son after hundreds of desires,
so he was dearer to him than life itself, due to the influence of past
affection. || 91 || Dhanada was Bhushan's brother in a previous life, and now he
is his father in this life. Indeed, the actions of beings in the world are as
strange as the actions of a clown. || 92 || Then, one night, as the night ended,
Bhushan heard the sound of the divine drum, saw the arrival of the devas, and
heard their words, which awakened him. || 93 || By nature, he was gentle-
hearted, devoted to the practice of the right dharma, filled with great joy, and
had his hands clasped together and placed on his head. || 94 || 1. Sangatau M. |

The 55th Chapter  This is a hymn in praise of Shri Dhar Muni. He was descending
the stairs when he was bitten by a snake and gave up his body. ||15|| He was
born in the fourth heaven called Maheindra. From there he fell and was born in
the city of Chandra Aditya in the Pushkar island as the son of King Prakash
Yash. His mother was Madhavi and he was named Jagad Yuti. When he reached the
peak of youth, he attained the highest fortune of the kingdom. ||16-17|| He was
very afraid of the world, so the old ministers taught him and with great
difficulty made him rule. ||18|| The old ministers said to him, "O son! Protect
this beautiful kingdom that has come down from your lineage, because only by
protecting the kingdom will all the people be happy." ||19|| He was adorned with
the ornaments of the kingdom, and he always kept the ascetics happy by providing
them with food and other necessities. Finally, he died and went to the land of
enjoyment called Devakuru, and from there he was born in the heaven of Aishan.
||100|| There, he enjoyed many pleasures for many Palyas, surrounded by
goddesses and taking on various forms, while possessing supreme radiance.
||101|| From there, he fell to the western Videha region of Jambudvipa, and was
born as the son of Queen Ratna, who was as simple as a young female buffalo of
the immovable Chakravarti. He was a bearer of great virtues, who brought joy to
all beings. He was beautiful in both body and name, that is, he was named
'Abhiram' and was very beautiful in body. ||102-103|| Abhiram was endowed with
great dispassion and was eager to take initiation, but the Chakravarti forcibly
married him and appointed him to the position of ruler, thus keeping him in the
world of wealth. ||104|| Three thousand women constantly nurtured him, a
virtuous son, with care, like an elephant in water. ||105|| Surrounded by all
those women, Abhiram considered the pleasures of love as poison, and with a
peaceful mind, he was eager to take the vows of a monk, but he could not achieve
it due to his father's control. ||106|| Sitting amidst all those women, adorned
with garlands, bracelets, crowns, and other ornaments, he performed the very
difficult vow of Asidhara. ||107|| He, the glorious Abhiram, sat on a fine seat,
surrounded by women, and gave teachings that praised the Jain religion. ||108||

144 Pachpuranas One who wanders in the wilderness of samsara for a long time,
attains this human birth through virtuous deeds. (10) Who, knowing, throws
himself into a well, O great soul? Who drinks poison? Or who sleeps on a
mountain peak? (110) Who, desiring jewels, touches the head of a serpent with
his hand? Or who is satisfied with the objects of the senses, which are
destructive? (111) Only the attachment to virtue is praiseworthy, leading to the
happiness of liberation. The lives of those who are devoid of desire are
extremely fickle. (112) Hearing these words, which preach the ultimate truth,
those women became calm and delighted in the rules according to their ability.
(113) Even in his beautiful body, that prince was free from attachment. He used
to remove the impurities of karma by fasting from the fourth day onwards. (114)
With a concentrated mind, he used to make his body thin by various austerities,
like the summer sun dries up water. (115) That Sudarshan, with a steady mind, a
hero, performed extremely difficult austerities for sixty-four thousand years.
(116) He attained liberation by dying in samadhi, accompanied by the five great
vows. He attained the highest divine state in the Brahma-uttar heaven in the
kalpa. (117) Then, the same soul, who was his father Dhanadaseth in the previous
birth, wandered through various births and was born in the city of Podanpur,
located in the southern part of the Bharat region, in the Jambudvipa. His
parents were a Brahmin named Agni-mukha and a Brahmin woman named Shakuma. He
was born to them as a son named Mridumati. He was called Mridumati, but he was
not soft-minded, but hard-minded. (118-119) His mind was attached to gambling
and disrespect, his path was dusty, and he was hated by people because of his
various offenses. He was a bearer of extremely evil deeds. (120) His parents,
distressed by the insults of the people, expelled him from the house. He
wandered here and there on earth and again reached Podanpur in his youth.

The Fifty-fifth Chapter 145  He entered the house and asked for some water to
drink. The Brahmin woman gave him water, and as she did so, tears fell from her
eyes. [122] With his soul satisfied by the cool water, he asked her, "Why are
you weeping with compassion?" When told this, the Brahmin woman said, [123]
"Good sir, your form is like that of a child, and I, along with my husband, had
once cast out our own son from the house in our cruelty. [124] If you have
wandered in any land and seen him somewhere, please tell me. He was dark like
the blue lotus."   Then, wiping his tears, he said, "O mother, cease your
weeping. I am your long-lost son who has now returned to you." [126] The Brahmin
woman, whose husband's name was Agnimukhya, attained the joy of regaining her
son and her breasts began to flow with milk. [127] He was brilliant, handsome,
intelligent, versed in various scriptures, and captivating to all women. He was
the crown jewel among the cunning. [128] He was always the victor in gambling,
extremely clever, a repository of arts, and addicted to sensual pleasures. He
thus continued to revel in the city. [129]  In that city of Podanapura, there
was a courtesan named Vasantadamara, the best among the courtesans. She was his
most desired companion in matters of love. [130] He had freed his parents and
other relatives from poverty, and they had attained the status of a king and
queen, enjoying all desired objects. [131] His father was resplendent with
ornaments like earrings, and his mother was adorned with girdles and other
ornaments, always engaged in various activities. [132] One day, this soft-
hearted one entered the royal palace of Sasakunama city to commit theft. There
he heard the king Nandivarddhana speaking in disgust to the queen. [133] He
said, "Today, I have heard the supreme dharma from the feet of my guru
Sasakunamukha, which bestows the bliss of liberation." [134] "Alas, these
sensual objects are like poison, and their consequences are extremely dreadful.
Therefore, I shall embrace initiation and not indulge in sorrow."

In the Padma Purana,  Hearing the words of the goddess, Sri Nandivardhana, the
king, became filled with pure understanding.  ||136|| Distressed by the nature
of the world, he took refuge in the pure one, the sage Chandramukha, and at his
feet, he renounced all attachments and received the Jain initiation. ||137|| He
performed severe austerities, following the scriptural injunctions, and with
patience, he accepted whatever alms he received. ||138|| On the peak of the
mountain, Durggagiri, the sage Gunanidhi, known for his virtues, performed a
four-month retreat, renouncing food. ||139|| Praised by gods and demons, the
steadfast sage, having completed his vow, flew through the sky, guided by divine
will. ||140|| Then, the virtuous Mridumati, seeking alms, arrived in the city of
Alok. He had a vision that encompassed all ages. ||141|| The people of the city,
including the king, were overjoyed to see him. Recognizing him as the sage who
resided on the mountain peak, they showed him great devotion. ||142|| They
offered him various kinds of food, seeking to satisfy him. But, blinded by the
allure of taste, he succumbed to the illusion of Maya. ||143|| The people said,
"You are the same sage who resided on the mountain peak, and the gods worshipped
you."  He bowed his head in acknowledgement, but did not deny their words.
||144|| Due to ignorance and pride, he had acquired the seed of suffering, and
by indulging in the pleasure of taste, he deceived himself. ||145|| He did not
remove the thorn of Maya from his heart before his guru, and thus, he became a
recipient of this ultimate suffering. ||146|| Then, Mridumati, after his time,
went to the realm of the glorious Abhiraama, a celestial being, where he resided
with great splendor. ||147|| Due to the influence of his past actions, he and
Abhiraama, both possessing great powers, experienced immense joy in the
celestial abode, Trivishtapa. ||148|| Surrounded by celestial beings, they lived
in the ocean of bliss, enjoying the fruits of their good deeds. ||149||
Therefore, I take the initiation. You are not worthy of sorrow. ||135||

## The Fifty-Fifth Chapter  Then, that gentle soul, due to the depletion of his
store of merit, fell from there and, tainted by the residue of Maya, came to
Jambudvipa.  || 150 ||  In Jambudvipa, there is a mountain named Nikunj, adorned
with lofty peaks, and on it, a dense forest called Shallki. || 151 ||  In that
forest, this elephant, resembling a gathering of clouds, came to be. His roar
was like the churning of the ocean, and he had conquered the wind with his
speed.  || 152 ||  His form was terrifying in anger, and he was immensely proud.
His tusks were as bright as the moon, and he possessed all the qualities of a
king of elephants. || 153 ||  He was born in the lineage of great elephants like
Vijay, and he was radiant. He seemed to harbor animosity towards Airavata, and
he fought at will. || 154 ||  He destroyed lions, tigers, large trees, and even
mountains. Even the celestial beings found it difficult to capture him.  || 155
||  He filled all the wild animals with fear with his mere scent, and he
delighted in playing in the mountain groves adorned with various leaves. || 156
||  He played in the Manas lake, which was unshakable, pure, and adorned with
various flowers, along with his followers. || 157 ||  He enjoyed his leisure in
the easily accessible Kailasa mountain and in the beautiful hearts of the
Mandakini river. He was supremely happy. || 158 ||  This great elephant, who
enhanced the prosperity of his kin, also enjoyed playing in the beautiful
mountain forests, apart from these places. || 159 ||  He enjoyed the company of
thousands of female elephants, who were eager to please him, and he experienced
the happiness befitting a leader of the herd. || 160 ||  Surrounded by a
multitude of elephants, he roamed here and there, looking as magnificent as
Garuda adorned with a flock of birds. || 161 ||  This supreme elephant, whose
roar was as deep as the thunder of clouds, and who was like a mountain for the
emergence of streams of charity, was seen by Ravana, the king of Lanka. || 162
||  Ravana, who was fierce in knowledge and prowess, subdued him and made him
beautiful with auspicious marks. || 163 ||  Thus, those two gods, who were
endowed with happiness and form, continued to play in that heaven, reaching many
oceans with their merit. || 146 ||  And then, that gentle soul, due to the
depletion of his store of merit, fell from there and, tainted by the residue of
Maya, came to Jambudvipa. || 150 ||

In the Padma Purana, The one who was once in heaven, playing with Apsaras for a
long time, enjoying happiness, is now playing with female elephants, enjoying
happiness. || 164 || Indeed, the power of karma is such that living beings, in
various births filled with suffering, attain supreme delight. || 165 || The one
who was once Abhirama, has now become King Bharata in Ayodhya. This Bharata is
very intelligent and his heart is attached to the right Dharma. || 166 || His
accumulated delusion has been destroyed, and he is averse to worldly pleasures.
This Bharata desires to become a monk to end rebirth. || 167 || In the time of
Lord Rishabhadeva, these two brothers, named Suryodaya and Chandrodaya, were
initiated into the Jain Dharma. But later, motivated by pride, they abandoned
the Mahavratas and were initiated into the Parivrajaka sect, led by Marichi. As
a result, they were afflicted by the suffering of the world, and they wandered
in the world for a long time, experiencing the fruits of their karma. || 168 -
169 || It is right, because in the world, those who do not perform austerities,
inevitably experience the fruits of their actions, which are both pleasurable
and painful. || 170 || The one who was once Chandrodaya, became a Kulankara, and
then a deer that died in meditation. He then became King Bharata, possessing a
noble heart. || 171 || And the one who was once Suryodaya, a Brahmin, became a
deer after death, and then, due to the influence of his past bad karma, he
attained the elephant form. || 172 || This elephant, possessing immense
strength, first uprooted the pillar of bondage and experienced anger. But later,
seeing Bharata, he remembered his past life and became calm. || 173 || Gautama
Swami says, "O wise ones! Knowing this way of coming and going, and the various
external pleasures and pains, abandon this forest of karma, which is full of
difficulties, and delight in Dharma. Because those who have attained the human
form and have not embraced the Dharma taught by the Jinas, are destined to
wander in the world,   1. Yo Ma. 2. Marichih Pravartate Ma. 3. Ramani Mrgah Ja.

Ācārya, known as Ārṣa, that having obtained the incomparable Jina Dharma, which
is revealed from the lotus face of the Jina, and is dedicated to bestowing
liberation, perform meritorious deeds that conquer the brilliance of the sun, so
that you may attain the pure supreme abode. ||175||  Thus ends the 58th chapter,
named **Bharatatribhuvanālaṅkārasamadhyanubhavānukīrtanaṃ**, which describes the

## The Sixty-Fourth Chapter  Hearing those words, so pure and holy, which
dispelled the darkness of ignorance, and which described the various sorrows of
the ocean of existence, and the past lives of Bharata, the entire assembly
became still, like a painted picture. [1-2]  Then, Bharata, with his earrings
swaying, renowned for his prowess, majestic and radiant like Indra, arose.
Filled with a great surge of emotion, his body humbled, his mind noble, he
clasped his hands in a lotus posture. [3-4]  Kneeling on the ground, he bowed to
the sage, his heart heavy with the burden of worldly existence. He spoke these
beautiful words: [5]  "O Master, I have wandered for ages through thousands of
births, each fraught with suffering. Exhausted by the great toil of the path, I
beseech you, grant me the cause of liberation." [6]  "O Lord, I have been swept
along for eons in the river of existence, tossed by the mighty waves of birth
and death. Please, be my handhold, my support." [7]  Having spoken thus, he
renounced all his possessions, freed himself from the bonds of the couch, and
with great courage, plucked out his hair with his own hand. [8]  Attaining
supreme enlightenment and embracing the great vows, Bharata was instantly
initiated, becoming a supreme sage. [9]  In the heavens, the gods cried out,
"Well done! Well done!" and showered divine flowers upon Bharata, now a sage.
[10]  Inspired by Bharata's devotion, over a thousand kings renounced their
worldly fortunes and embraced the life of a sage. [11]  Many others, lacking the
strength to renounce, bowed to the sage and embraced the householder's life
according to the scriptures. [12]  Keki, Bharata's mother, overwhelmed with
grief and her mind consumed by sorrow, ran after him, weeping uncontrollably.
She collapsed on the ground, overcome by despair. [13]

## The Sixty-Sixth Chapter  **151**  **14.**  Then, overwhelmed by the weight of
her son's love, Kekaya lay motionless. Even when sprinkled with sandalwood water
from the head of the cow, she did not regain consciousness.  **15.**  After a
long time, she regained consciousness and, like a cow separated from her calf,
cried out in sorrow.  **16.**  "Oh, my son! You were the joy of my heart, so
gentle and full of virtues. Where have you gone? Answer me, and hold me in your
arms."  **17.**  "Oh, my son! Abandoned by you, I am drowning in the ocean of
sorrow. How can I bear this pain? What have you done?"  **18.**  Hearing her
lament, Rama and Lakshmana, the charioteers, comforted her with beautiful words.
**19.**  "Mother, Bharata is virtuous and wise. Abandon your sorrow. Are we not
your obedient sons?"  **20.**  Thus, Kekaya, whose fear-induced anxiety was
overcome and whose heart was pure, was freed from sorrow by the words of her co-
wives.  **21.**  Awakening to her true self, she condemned her own body. "Cursed
is this female form, covered in so many flaws! It is utterly impure, repulsive,
like the sewage of a city. I will perform actions that will liberate me from the
cycle of karma."  **22.**  Kekaya had already been influenced by the teachings
of the Jinas. Filled with great dispassion, she donned a white robe.  **23.**
She then received initiation from the Arya named Prithivimati, along with three
hundred other women, while upholding the pure Samyaktvam.  **24.**  Abandoning
all the entanglements of household life and embracing the supreme Dharma of the
Aryikas, Kekaya shone like a spotless moon, free from the association of clouds.
**25.**  At that time, the assembly of the Muni Raja, the ornament of the land,
was adorned with a group of Munis possessing great brilliance on one side, and a
multitude of Aryikas on the other. The assembly was beautiful, like a lake
filled with lotuses.  **26.**  (The text is incomplete here. It seems to be
referring to the assembly of the Muni Raja, but the sentence is cut off.)

various vow-related activities. Just as the sun's rays illuminate all noble
people, so too is it natural for them to be engaged in such activities. ||27||
Thus ends the 86th chapter of the Padmapurana, known as the "Bharata-Kekaya-

with Aryikas, making it appear like a beautiful lake adorned with lotuses and

## The Seventy-Seventh Festival  **1.**  And thus, the noble one, with a
peaceful soul, an ornament of the three worlds, was adorned with the Anuvrata by
the Muni, according to the prescribed rules.  **2.**  United with right faith,
he was a possessor of right knowledge, engaged in right conduct, and complete in
the householder's dharma. He was like a wild elephant.  **3.**  He observed
fasts for a fortnight or a month, and after the fast, he would perform his
Parana with fallen leaves, once a day.  **4.**  This elephant, fearful of the
world, devoted to right actions, and full of purity, was worshipped by people
and roamed the earth.  **5.**  At the time of Parana, people offered him sweet
laddoos, mandakas, and various kinds of puris with great respect.  **6.**  His
body and karma were both extremely weakened, bound by the pillar of passion, and
controlled by the whip of Yama. This elephant performed intense austerities for
four years.  **7.**  Gradually abandoning food, he intensified his austerities.
He attained the Brahma-uttar heaven after performing Sallekhana.  **8.**
Adorned with garlands and earrings, surrounded by beautiful women, he enjoyed
the pleasures of the gods, due to the influence of his past good deeds.  **9.**
Bharata, too, was a great soul, a great observer of the Mahavratas, a universal
being, firm like a mountain, a renunciant of external and internal possessions,
free from attachment to the body, a great hero, and a devotee of the four forms
of worship. He would sit where the sun sets.  **10.**  He roamed about
righteously, engaged in the four forms of worship.  **11.**  He was free from
bondage like the wind, fearless like a lion, undisturbed like the ocean, and
unshakable like Mount Meru.  **12.**  He was a Digambara, adorned with the armor
of truth, armed with the arrows of forgiveness, and always engaged in conquering
the enemies of the soul. He was always engaged in the battle of austerities.
**13.**  He was equal to both enemies and friends, equal in happiness and
sorrow, equal to grass and jewels. He was a great Shraman, with an equal mind.

## Chapter 78: The Nirvana of Bharata  **154**  The great sage Bharata, adorned
with the virtues of a true Jain, traversed the paths of knowledge, guided by the
scriptures. He fearlessly walked even through the territories of his enemies.
**(14)**  Having completely destroyed the karmic roots of delusion, he attained
the supreme knowledge, the light that illuminates both the world and the beyond.
**(15)**  The glorious Arya Goti, endowed with such greatness, and having
eradicated the karmic dust, attained the desired state of liberation, from which
there is no return. **(16)**  Gautama Swami says, "Whoever, with devotion,
narrates or listens to this pure and virtuous story of Bharata, will attain
longevity, fame, glory, strength, wealth, prosperity, and health." **(17)**
This story is the essence of all narratives, adorned with noble qualities and
radiant. O noble ones, listen attentively, for you will soon conquer the
brilliance of the sun. **(18)**  Thus ends the seventy-eighth chapter of the
Padma Purana, titled "The Nirvana of Bharata," narrated by the revered Ravishena
Acharya, known as the Arya. **(8)**

## The Eighty-Eighth Chapter  Great kings, heroes like Bharata, renounced their
kingdoms and embraced the path of renunciation, even though they had no desire
for their own bodies. ||1||  They attained the rare path, these great souls. I
will recount the names of some of them, listen, O king. ||2||  Siddhartha,
Siddhasadhyarthi, Ratido, Rativardhana, Ambuvahara, Jambunada, Shalya,
Shashankapat, Viraso, Nandano, Nanda, Anand, Sumati, Sudhi, Sadashraya,
Mahabuddhi, Suryaro, Janavallabha, Indradhwaja, Shruthadhara, Suchandra,
Prithividhara, Alak, Sumati, Krodha, Kundara, Satyavan, Hari, Sumit,
Dharmamitraya, Sampurnendu, Prabhakar, Naghusha, Sundana, Shanti, Priyadharma,
and others. ||3-6||  These kings were born into pure families, devoted to good
conduct, possessed thousands of followers, and their deeds were renowned
throughout the world. ||7||  They renounced elephants, horses, foot soldiers,
coral, gold, pearls, their harems, and kingdoms, considering them all like
withered grass, and embraced the great vows. They were peaceful, possessed
various powers, and attained the appropriate stage according to their
meditation. ||8-9||  When Bharata, the one who acted like the emperor Bharata,
renounced the world, Lakshmana, remembering his virtues, felt empty. ||10||  His
mind was filled with sorrow, he was consumed by grief, his voice was choked with
sobs, his eyes, like blue lotuses, were dull, and his body leaned against the
pillars of the palace. Yet, he, radiant with Lakshmi, spoke softly. ||11-12||
Where is Bharata now, adorned with virtues, who, even in his youth, renounced
his attachment to his body? ||13||  How did he, desiring to become a Siddha,
embrace the difficult Jain Dharma, abandoning his beloved family and a kingdom
like that of the gods? ||14||  1. Naghusha.

156 Padma Purana The knower of the rules and regulations, Rama, said that
Bharata is supremely blessed and very great. ||15|| Only his intellect is pure,
and his birth is meaningful, because he has renounced the kingdom, which is like
food mixed with poison, and has attained the state of initiation. ||16|| How can
the worthiness of that supreme yogi be described, whose storehouse of virtues
even Indra is unable to describe? ||17|| The kings, who had begun to describe
the virtues of Bharata, were for a moment, filled with a mixture of the flavors
of happiness and sorrow. ||18|| Then, when Rama and Lakshmana, filled with
anxiety, stood up, the kings, filled with great wonder, went to their respective
places. ||19|| Then, after considering the matter, the kings, whose minds were
fixed on their duty, approached Rama, bowed to him, and spoke these words with
affection. ||20|| They said, "O Lord! Whether we are learned or ignorant, be
pleased with us. You are like the gods in radiance, so grant your consent to the
coronation." ||21|| "O best of men! Grant success to our eyes and to our hearts,
which are filled with the joy of your coronation." ||22|| Rama said, "Where
Lakshmana, the king of kings, who possesses the seven treasures, bows down to my
feet every day, what need have I of a kingdom?" ||23|| "Therefore, you should
not speak such words against me, for the kingdom is said to be only the
fulfillment of one's desires." ||24|| Having said this, they all praised Rama
with shouts of victory, and went to Lakshmana, and bowing to him, requested him
to accept the coronation. In response, Lakshmana went to Sri Rama. ||25|| Then,
at the beginning of the rainy season, drums were beaten, whose sound was like
that of the gathering clouds, and whose beginning was marked by the sound of
conch shells. ||26|| Dundubhi, dhakka, jhallar, and the best of musical
instruments, such as flutes, were playing, and their sounds were mixed with the
sound of the conch shell. ||27|| Beautiful auspicious songs and various kinds of
dances were performed, which were pleasing to the mind and gave great joy.

## The Eighty-Eighth Chapter  157  Upon the occasion of this grand festival,
Rama and Lakshmana, adorned with supreme glory, ascended the throne for the
coronation ceremony. [23] They were crowned with due rituals, using golden and
silver urns, adorned with lotuses, and crafted with various precious gems. [30]
Both brothers were adorned with crowns, angadas, keyuras, garlands, and
earrings. They were also adorned with divine garlands and garments, and were
anointed with the finest perfumes. [31] "Victory to Rama, the wielder of the
halberd! Victory to Lakshmana, the wielder of the chakra!" Thus, the celestial
beings hailed them with shouts of victory. [32] After celebrating this grand
festival for the two kings, the celestial kings went to coronate the queen, the
daughter of Videha. [33] She, Sita, was already blessed with great fortune, and
by this coronation, she became the foremost among all the goddesses. [34] With
shouts of joy and victory, they coronated Vaidehi, signifying the glory of the
Chakravarti's queen. [35] Vishalya, who had become Lakshmana's consort by giving
him life, was also coronated, but her coronation was merely a formality, as she
was already his queen. [36] "Victory to Lakshmana, the lord of the three worlds!
Victory to you, beautiful one!" Thus, they hailed her with shouts of victory and
remained happily. [37]  Rama bestowed the kingdom of Trikuta peak upon
Vibhishana, the kingdom of Kishkindha upon Sugriva, the king of the Vanaras, the
kingdom of Sriparvata upon Hanuman, the kingdom of Sri Nagar upon the lineage of
King Viradhit, and the vast kingdom of Kishkindha, adorned with many wonders and
kissed by the waves of the great ocean, upon Nal and Neel. [38-40] He bestowed
the kingdom of Rathnapura, a renowned city situated in the south of Vijay
mountain, upon the fierce celestial beings who bowed before him. [41] He made
Ratnajati the king of Devopagit Nagar, and the rest were made the rulers of
their respective territories. [42]  Beautiful songs and various enchanting
dances were providing supreme joy. [28]

158 Padma Purana Thus, the kings who had attained a long-lasting kingdom worthy
of their own punya-udaya, and who were filled with joy due to Rama's permission,
stood in their respective places, radiant. ||43|| Gautama Swami says, "Those
humans who, knowing the vast fruit of the influence of punya, which is famous in
the world, are devoted to dharma, make even the sun's radiance appear thin."
||44|| Thus ends the 88th Parva, named Rajyabhisheka, which describes the
coronation and shows the division of the kingdom, in the Padma Purana, narrated
by Sri Ravipena Acharya, known as Aarsha. ||8|| 1. Tanvam M.

The Most Auspicious Festival  Then, the ever-joyful Rama and Lakshmana said to
Shatrughna, "Accept the kingdom that you desire." [1]  "Do you wish to take half
of Ayodhya, or the excellent Podanapuram, or the city of Rajagriha, or the
beautiful city of Paundrasundara?" [2]  Thus, Rama and Lakshmana suggested
hundreds of capitals to the valiant Shatrughna, but none of them found a place
in his heart. [3]  Then, when Shatrughna requested Mathura, Rama said to him,
"Do you not know that the king of Mathura is Madhu, our enemy?" [4]  "He is the
son-in-law of Ravana, adorned with many battles, and the god of the sky,
Chandra, has given him a spear that never fails, which is invincible even by the
gods, as unbearable as the sun in the summer, and which, after taking thousands
of lives, returns to his hand." [5-6]  "For whose sake, we are constantly
worried and cannot sleep at night, even for a moment." [7]  "Just as the sun,
rising, illuminates the entire world, so too, he, upon his birth, illuminated
the vast lineage of the Haris." [8]  "And whose son, Lavanaarnava, is invincible
even by the celestial beings, how can you, O valiant one, conquer him?" [9]
Then, Shatrughna said, "What is the use of talking so much? Give me Mathura, and
I will take it myself." [10]  "If I do not crush Madhu in battle, like a bee
crushing a honeycomb, then I will not be proud of being the son of Dasharatha."
[11]  "If I do not pulverize his army, like a Sarabha destroying a group of
lions, then I will not be your brother." [12]  "If I do not put that enemy to
eternal sleep, then I will not be called a son born from a noble womb, and I
will not be protected by your blessings." [13]  Thus, the valiant Shatrughna,
the bearer of great brilliance, having obtained the aforementioned vow, ... [14]

160 Padmapurana Thus, when they were mounted on that excellent steed, the
Vidyaadhara lords were filled with utmost wonder. ||14|| Then, to go towards
him, Saagara, having moved away Shatrughna, said, "O Dheer, I request you to
give me a Dakshina." ||15|| Shatrughna, the vanquisher of darkness, said, "You
are the unparalleled, the all-pervading giver. What can be more praiseworthy
than your request? What else can be more auspicious for me?" ||16|| "You are the
lord even of our lives, what to speak of other things? What can I do for you,
except to remove the obstacle of this war?" ||17|| Reflecting, Padmaabha said,
"O Vatsa, you should attack Madhu only when he is devoid of the Shula-ratna. Do
not attack him at any other time." ||18|| Saying, "As you command," Shatrughna,
after paying homage to the Siddhas and taking their blessings, ate food and
then, coming to his mother, bowed to her and asked, "Are you well?" ||19||
Seeing her son, the queen, out of affection, smelled his head and said, "O
Vatsa, conquer the enemy forces with your sharp arrows." ||20|| Making him sit
on the half-seat, the valiant queen, again said, "O Veer, you should not show
your back to the enemies in the battle." ||21|| "O son, seeing you victorious
and returned from the battle, I will perform the highest worship of the Jinas
with golden lotuses." ||22|| "May the Jinas, who are auspicious for the three
worlds, who are worshipped by the gods and demons, grant you auspiciousness,
being free from attachment." ||23|| "May the Arhants, the Bhagavants, who have
conquered the extremely difficult delusion caused by worldly existence, be
auspicious for you." ||24|| "May the self-enlightened Jinas, who teach the
Dharma of the four paths and the three times, grant you the intellect to conquer
your enemies." ||25|| "May the Kevala-jnanis, who see all the worlds and beings
like a myrobalan fruit held in the hand, be auspicious for you." ||26|| "May the
Siddhas, who are free from karma and form, who reside above the three worlds,
who are the givers of Siddhi, be auspicious for you, O Vatsa." ||27|| "May the
Aachaaryas, who are like the lotus, the sun, the moon, the Mandara mountain, and
the sky, who are the supreme support, be auspicious for you." ||28|| Then, the
Vidyaadhara king was filled with utmost wonder. ||14|| Then, to go towards him,
Saagara, having moved away Shatrughna, said, "O Dheer, I request you to give me

The most auspicious festival Those who know the governance of the Self and who
are followers of the governance of the Self, those ever-living teachers, may
they be auspicious for you. ||26|| Those who attain liberation through the
twelve-fold austerity, those virtuous, brave ones, may they be auspicious for
you. ||30|| Having received this divine auspicious blessing, which removes
obstacles, and having bowed to his mother, Shatrughna went out of the house.
||31|| He mounted a great elephant adorned with golden garlands, and he shone
like the full moon on the back of a cloud. ||32|| Surrounded by hundreds of
kings mounted on various vehicles, he shone like Indra surrounded by gods.
||33|| Having come to meet his brother, who was very dear to him, he said, "O
venerable one, return now, I will go ahead without any expectations." ||34||
Lakshmana presented him with the bow-jewel called Samudraavarta and arrows with
fiery mouths, swift as the wind. ||35|| Having appointed Krtaantavaktra, who was
his equal, as his commander, Rama, filled with anxiety, returned with Lakshmana.
||36|| The valiant hero, Shatrughna, endowed with great strength, went towards
Mathura, which was ruled by Madhu. ||37|| Having reached the bank of the holy
Punyabhaga river, he halted his army, which had come from a long distance, with
some confusion. ||38|| The group of ministers, who had completed all their tasks
and whose fatigue had subsided, and whose intellect was very subtle, began to
doubt. ||39|| "Oh, look at the mind of this boy, who desires the defeat of
Madhu, who is devoid of policy and is driven only by pride." ||40|| "How can
this boy conquer Madhu, who was conquered by the mighty Mandhata in battle, who
was difficult to conquer even by the celestial beings?" ||41|| "How can he, with
his arms, cross the ocean of Madhu, whose advancing foot soldiers are like
towering waves?" ||42|| May the Acharya Parameshti, who is as radiant as the
sun, as peaceful as the moon, as steady as the earth, as lofty and generous as
Sumeru, as deep as the ocean, and as detached as the sky, and who is the
ultimate foundation, be auspicious for you. ||2|| May the Acharya Parameshti,
who knows the governance of the Self and the other, and who always teaches his
followers, be auspicious for you, O long-lived one. ||26|| And may the virtuous,
brave Sadhu Parameshti, who attain liberation through the twelve-fold austerity,
be auspicious for you, O Bhadra. ||30||

In the Padma Purana, "Who can enter the forest of Madhu, which is filled with
large trees and fierce, intoxicated elephants, and emerge alive?" (43) Hearing
this, the commander of the army, with a face like death, said, "Why are you all
so afraid? Why have you abandoned your pride?" (44) "Even though Madhu is
arrogant because of his invincible spear, he is still capable of being killed by
the handsome Shatrughna." (45) "A strong elephant, even though it can uproot
trees with its trunk, is still killed by a lion." (46) "Shatrughna is endowed
with Lakshmi and prowess, he is patient, strong, intelligent, and has excellent
allies, so he will surely destroy the enemy." (47) Then, the spies, following
the orders of the ministers, went to the city of Mathura. Upon their return,
they reported the news as follows: "Listen, O gods! There is a city called
Mathura in the eastern direction. Outside the city, there is a very beautiful
garden surrounded by the royal quarters." (48-49) "Just as the garden of Kubera,
called Kubera-chchanda, is situated in the middle of the divine forest, and is
filled with the fulfillment of desires, so too is this garden." (50) "King Madhu
resides in this garden with his queen, Jayanti. Just as an elephant is subdued
by a female elephant, so too is Madhu subdued by his queen." (51) "He is very
lustful, he has abandoned all other duties, he is very proud, and he is under
the influence of delusion. Today is the sixth day since he has been staying in
the garden." (52) "Madhu, whose mind is under the control of lust, does not know
of your vow, nor does he know of your arrival. Just as a physician neglects a
patient, so too have the wise neglected him because of the strength of his
delusion." (53) "If we do not conquer Mathura now, then the ocean of Madhu will
become unbearable due to the flow of rivers, which are the armies of other men.
It will be difficult to conquer him." (54) Hearing these words, Shatrughna, who
was skilled in strategy, set out for Mathura with an army of one hundred
thousand horses. (55) 1. Devakuro - Divine forest. 2. Ashvaanam - Horses.

## The Most Auspicious Festival ### 163  While everyone was lost in slumber at
midnight, the glorious Shatrughna, having attained great prosperity, returned
and entered the gates of Mathura. ||56||  Shatrughna was like a yogi, the gates
were like a heap of dust, and Mathura was like a land of attainment, beautiful
and delightful. ||57||  "Victory to Shatrughna, the son of Dasharatha!" A great
roar arose from the mouths of the people, praising him. ||58||  Just as the
people of Lanka were filled with fear and anxiety when Angada arrived, so too
were the people of Mathura filled with fear and anxiety when they learned of the
city's invasion by the enemy. ||59||  The women, their eyes trembling with fear
and their hearts filled with anxiety, felt their unborn children stir within
them. ||60||  Awakened by the loud clamor, the brave warriors, fearless like
lions, rose up instantly. ||61||  Shatrughna, with his immense strength,
destroyed the enemy forces with a mere sound, and entered the home of King
Madhu. ||62||  There, he stood, protected by his divine weapons, guarding the
armory. He was pleased and had achieved his rightful success. ||63||  With his
sweet and charming words, he comforted everyone, and they all abandoned their
fear. ||64||  Knowing that Shatrughna had entered Mathura, Madhusundara, with
his great strength, emerged from his garden, filled with rage like Ravana.
||65||  Just as a soul protected by a sage cannot be touched by delusion, so too
could King Madhu not enter the place protected by Shatrughna. ||66||  Though
Madhu tried various ways to enter Mathura, he was unable to do so. He was
without a weapon, but despite his pride, he did not seek peace with Shatrughna.
||67||  Unable to bear the sight of the enemy's arrogant army, Shatrughna's
cavalrymen rode out from their ranks. ||68||  As the battle began, Shatrughna's
entire army arrived, and the two armies, like vast oceans, clashed. ||69||
Chariots, elephants, and foot soldiers, all equipped with various weapons,
clashed with each other, their speed and power unmatched. ||70||

164 Padma Purana The army of Asahanparasainya could not bear the pride of the
fierce and mighty sound. The wicked Krtaanta, with his swift and powerful army,
rushed into the battle. ||7|| He played in the battle, his speed unchecked, like
Indra in the garden of the self-born. ||72|| Then, seeing him, the prince
Lavanaarnava, like a cloud, covered him with arrows. ||73|| He, in turn, with
arrows like serpents, drawn to his ears, cut off his arrows, filling the earth
and sky with them. ||74|| They, fierce in strength, like lions, tore at each
other, mounted on the backs of elephants, filled with anger, they fought. ||75||
Krtaanta, struck first in the chest, made his armor a shield against the arrows
of the enemy. ||76|| Then, raising his spear, Lavanaarnava, with eyes blazing
with anger, struck Krtaanta in the face. ||77|| Both, drenched in their own
blood, fierce and engaged in a great battle, shone like two blooming Palasha
trees. ||78|| There was a terrible clash of maces, swords, and discs between
them, fueled by their mutual madness and desire to conquer. ||79|| Lavanaarnava,
struck by a Shakti, fought for a long time, but fell to the ground, his chest
pierced, his heavenly merit exhausted. ||80|| Seeing his son fall, Madhu, with a
sweet cry, ran towards Krtaanta, but was stopped by Shatrughna, who roared at
him. ||81|| Madhu, overwhelmed by unbearable grief and anger, was stopped by the
mountain-like Shatrughna, and grew in proximity. ||82|| Unable to see his sight,
like that of a venomous serpent, Shatrughna's army fled, like a swarm of dry
leaves scattered by a strong wind. ||83|| Seeing him approaching, the warriors,
filled with pride, returned to face Shatrughna. ||84|| The horsemen and foot
soldiers, the swift chariots, the elephants, and the horsemen and foot soldiers
clashed together. ||70|| Krtaanta, unable to bear the pride of the fierce sound
of the enemy army, rushed into the enemy ranks with great speed. ||71|| He
played in the battle, his speed unchecked, like Indra in the garden of the self-
born. ||72|| Then, seeing him, the prince Lavanaarnava, like a cloud, covered
him with arrows. ||73|| He, in turn, with arrows like serpents, drawn to his
ears, cut off his arrows, filling the earth and sky with them. ||74|| They,
fierce in strength, like lions, tore at each other, mounted on the backs of

## The Most Auspicious Festival  Those who follow, filled with fear, are
defeated only until they see their lord, with a smiling face, in front of them.
||85||  Then, mounted on an excellent chariot, wielding a divine bow, his chest
adorned with a garland, his crown and earrings swaying, shining like the autumn
sun, unstoppable in his movement, the lord, filled with extreme anger, faced the
enemy. ||86-87||  Just as a fire consumes a pile of dry leaves in an instant, so
too did the destroyer of enemies, Shatrughna, burn hundreds of warriors in a
moment. ||88||  No warrior could stand against him in battle, just as no one
tainted by other doctrines can stand before a learned man of the Jain faith.
||89||  Any human who wished to fight him met the same fate as an elephant
facing a lion, destroyed in an instant. ||60||  Their army, like the insane, was
utterly distraught, falling, heavily wounded, seeking refuge in Madhu. ||61||
As Shatrughna advanced, Madhu cut his banner, and Shatrughna, in turn, pierced
his chariots and horses with arrows sharp as razors. ||62||  Then, Madhu, his
mind filled with confusion, his body burning with anger, mounted a huge
elephant, like a mountain. ||63||  Like a great cloud covering the sun, Madhu
aimed to cover Shatrughna with a continuous barrage of arrows. ||64||  The
clever Shatrughna, in turn, pierced his arrows and armor, welcoming him to the
battle with a generous offering of arrows, as is the custom. ||65||  Then,
Madhu, realizing he was armed only with a spear, and burdened by the great
sorrow of his son's death, saw his enemy as invincible and thought, "My end is
near." ||66||  Remembering his past deeds, his wisdom, his non-violence, his
words, his patience, he realized that his karma was exhausted. ||67||

---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, at the beginning of this impermanent and sorrowful
existence, what single act is praiseworthy in this world? It is the act that
leads to Dharma. (18)  A virtuous soul, having obtained human birth, who does
not apply their mind to Dharma, is truly cheated by the karma of delusion. (6)
Knowing that rebirth is certain, I, a sinner, did not act in my own best
interest when time was in my control. Alas, I am a fool, a careless one. (100)
Why did I not develop wisdom when I was in control of my own actions? Now that
the enemy is before me, what can I do, a wretched soul? (101)  What is the use
of digging a well when the house is on fire? And what is the time for chanting
mantras when one has been bitten by a snake? These actions should have been done
beforehand. (102)  In this situation, it seems right to me to calm my mind and
seek a good resolution, for that is the cause of self-benefit. (103)
Salutations to the Arhats, the liberated ones, the Acharyas, the Upadhyayas, and
the Sadhus, these five supreme beings. (104)  The Arhats, the liberated ones,
the Sadhus, and the Kevalis, along with Dharma, are the four auspicious things
that are always beneficial to me. (105)  In the three and a half islands, in the
fifteen realms of karma, I bow down to all the Arhats, the lords of the world,
with my mind, speech, and body. (106)  As long as I live, I will abandon the
external yoga, but not the pure soul. I condemn the past karma I have
accumulated and am dedicated to renunciation. (107)  In this endless forest of
existence, the sins I have committed are false. I am now absorbed in
contemplating the truth. (108)  I abandon all that is to be abandoned and accept
all that is to be accepted. Knowledge and vision are my soul, while the rest are
merely characteristics of association with objects. (109)  For the sake of
liberation, neither grass nor the best land is a support, but only the soul free
from contaminated mind is the true support. (110)  Thus, having ascended to the
proper meditation, he abandoned both internal and external attachments. (111)
The karma that caused his birth was exhausted, and with great patience and
remorse, he remembered the words of the Digambara monks. (66-67)  He began to
think that this entire beginning is fleeting and brings only sorrow. In this
world, the only act worthy of praise is the one that leads to Dharma. (68)

## The Eighty-Ninth Chapter  **The Most Auspicious Festival**  Even though his
body was riddled with deep wounds, he held firm to his unwavering fortitude. He
had renounced attachment to his body and all its possessions, and his mind was
now perfectly pure. || 112 ||  Upon seeing this, Shatrughna approached him and
offered his salutations, saying, "O virtuous one, please forgive this sinner."
|| 113 ||  The celestial nymphs, who had come to witness the battle, were filled
with wonder and showered him with flowers, their hearts overflowing with pure
emotions. || 114 ||  **The Story of the Lineage**  Then, entering into Samadhi,
Madhu, in the blink of an eye, merged his consciousness into the ocean of
supreme bliss, becoming the exalted celestial being, Sanatkumara. || 115 ||  The
valiant Shatrughna, having fulfilled his purpose, entered Mathura with great
joy. He resided there, just as Megheshvara-Jayakumar had resided in Hastinapur.
|| 116 ||  Gautama Swami said, "O King! Those who attain Samadhi and take birth
in the world, acquire a divine form. Therefore, O noble ones, always engage in
virtuous deeds, so that you may attain a radiance surpassing even that of the
sun." || 117 ||  Thus ends the eighty-ninth chapter of the Padma Purana, known

## The Latest Chapter  The divine, infallible, jewel-like spear, though potent,
was rendered ineffective by the power of the enemy. Its brilliance was
extinguished, and it deviated from its ordained path. (1)  Carrying sorrow,
grief, and shame, like a bird released from its cage, he went to his master, the
lord of the Asuras, Chamarendra. (2)  Upon hearing the news of Madhu's demise
from the spear, Chamarendra, whose heart was filled with memories of their
friendship, was overwhelmed with sorrow and grief. (3)  Rising from the
netherworld with great speed and brilliance, fueled by rage, he set out for
Mathura. (4)  While roaming, the king of the Garuda, Venudhari, saw Chamarendra
and asked, "O king of the Daityas, where are you headed?" (5)  Chamarendra
replied, "I am determined to avenge the injustice done to my dear friend, Madhu,
by the one who killed him." (6)  The king of the Garuda said, "Have you never
heard of the greatness of Vishalya, which you seem to disregard?" (7)
Chamarendra responded, "Those times of wonder have passed, when Vishalya
possessed such unimaginable power." (8)  "When she was bound by the vow of her
youth, she was indeed a wonder. Now, through her union with Narayana, she is
like a serpent devoid of venom." (9)  "The virtues of those who follow a
righteous path, who are wise and free from all transgressions, are born from
their past good deeds and are worthy of praise." (10)  "Vishalya, with her
immense pride, triumphed only until she saw the face of Narayana, who embodies
desire." (11)  "The gods, demons, and ghosts fear those who follow their vows,
until they abandon their sharp sword of determination." (12)

Navatitimaparva  1. As long as the wicked do not cross a hundred steps, the
righteous path of this one (Mahavira) is not violated. (13)  2. Have you not
heard of the terrible Kalaagni, one of the Rudras, who, attached to his beloved,
became indifferent and went to his death? (14)  3. Go, what is the use of this
to you? Do as you wish, I myself will know the duty towards friend and foe. (15)
4. Saying this, the extremely distressed one crossed the sky and reached
Mathura, and saw there an extremely grand festival pervading all the people.
(16)  5. And he thought that this world is ungrateful and very wicked. In the
homeland and the state, there is joy even in the place of sorrow. (17)  6. He
who, taking refuge in the shadow of his arms, has long enjoyed the happiness of
the gods, how is this world distressed by the death of Madhu? (18)  7. The brave
is to be served by the cowards, and the learned by thousands of brave ones. One
may serve even a foolish elephant, but should abandon the ungrateful. (19)  8.
Let that king who has killed my dear one be. I shall bring about the destruction
of this entire kingdom. (20)  9. Thinking thus, the extremely fierce one,
impelled by the arsenal of anger, began to inflict unbearable calamity on the
people. (21)  10. Manifesting extremely grave diseases, he was ready to burn the
world, devoid of compassion, like the fire of destruction. (22)  11. Wherever
one stood, sat or lay, there he fell into deep sleep, unmoving. (23)  12. Seeing
the calamity, prompted by the family deity, Shatrughna, equipped with means,
went to Ayodhya. (24)  13. The brave Shatrughna, returned victorious from the
great battle, was joyfully welcomed by Rama, Lakshmana and others. (25)  14. The
fulfilled Suprajaa, after performing the worship of the Jina, gave great
donations to the righteous and the distressed. (26)  15. Although the city of
Ayodhya was extremely delightful with its golden palaces, it was like a cow,
skilled in granting all desires, enjoying the pleasures of the three worlds.

**Padma Purana**  Shtrughna Kumar, though endowed with the heart of a protector
of Mathurapuri, was deeply attached to it. Just as Rama could not find solace
without Vaidehi, so too, Shtrughna could not find solace without Mathura. ||28||
The union of beautiful things with beings is like a dream, fleeting and
ephemeral. It generates a sorrow far greater than the scorching heat of the
summer sun. ||2||  Thus ends the ninetieth chapter of the Padma Purana, titled
"Mathura Upa-sarga," narrated by the sage Ravishena. ||10||  She was beautiful,
skilled in fulfilling all desires like the wish-fulfilling cow, and adorned with
heavenly pleasures. Yet, the heart of Shtrughna Kumar remained deeply attached

could not find solace without Mathura. ||27-28||  Gautama Swami said, "O

The 19th Chapter  Then the king of Rajagriha, filled with wonder, asked Gautama
Swami, "O Bhagavan, for what reason did Shatrughna desire that very Mathura?"
||1||  "There are many other capitals, resembling the heavens. Why is it that
the valiant Shatrughna had such affection only for Mathura?" ||2||  Then Gautama
Ganadhara, like the moon amidst the ocean of divine knowledge and the
constellation of Ganadharas, said, "I will tell you the reason for Shatrughna's
affection for Mathura. Keep it in your mind." ||3||  "For he had many births in
that very Mathura. Therefore, he had great affection for it." ||4||  "A being,
who is a devotee of the ocean of Samsara, due to his karmic nature, was born in
the Mathura city of the Bharat Kshetra of Jambudvipa as Yamunadeva. He was cruel
by nature and completely averse to Dharma. After death, he became a pig, then a
donkey, and then a crow." ||5-6||  "Then he became a goat, and then, after being
burnt in a fire, he became a buffalo with long horns. This buffalo was used for
carrying water." ||7||  "This being of Yamunadeva became a buffalo six times,
suffering various miseries, and five times he was born as a poor man in low
families." ||8||  "It is right, for those beings who follow the middle path,
become Aryas and humans, and experience some reduction in their karma." ||9||
"Then he was born as a Brahmin named Kulandhara, who was devoted to the service
of the virtuous. He was handsome, but devoid of the practice of good conduct."
||10||  "One day, the king of that city, with the hope of victory, went to
another country without any fear. His queen, named Lalita, was alone in the
palace. One day, she was looking out of the window when she saw that wicked
Brahmin making gestures." ||11-12||  "Seeing Kulandhara, the Brahmin, playing,
the queen was struck by the arrows of love. She had him brought to a secluded
place by a trusted maid." ||13||  "When he entered the palace, the king, who was
unaware of his arrival, saw his actions by chance." ||14||

## Chapter 172 of the Padma Purana  172 Padma Purana  While seated on an asana
with the queen, the king suddenly arrived and witnessed his actions. ||14||
Although the queen, skilled in deception, cried out loudly, "This is a captive,"
the king did not believe her, and the warriors seized the frightened Brahmin.
||15||    Thereafter, to inflict punishment on all eight limbs, the Kulandhara
Brahmin was taken outside the city. There, a virtuous sage named Kalyana, whom
he had served many times, saw him and said, "If you take initiation, I will save
you." Kulandhara accepted initiation, and the sage rescued him from the wicked
men of the king. Upon being rescued, he became a Shraman sage. ||16-17||
Subsequently, with great devotion, he performed extremely arduous austerities
and became the lord of the Ritu-Vimana of the Saudharma heaven. Indeed, what is
difficult for Dharma? ||18||  Then, in Mathura, there was a generous king named
Chandrabhad. His wife's name was Dhura, and she had three brothers: Suryadeva,
Sagaradeva, and Yamunadeva. Besides these brothers, he had eight sons: Shrimukh,
Sanmukh, Sumukh, Indramukh, Prabhamukh, Ugramukh, Arkamukh, and Aparamukha.
||16-20||  Chandrabhad's second wife, who was unique and unparalleled even
though she was the second, was named Kanakaprabha. When the soul of Kulandhara
Brahmin fell from the Ritu-Vimana, he was born to her as a son named Achal.
||21||  Achal was rich in arts and virtues, captivating the minds of all people,
and he was always eager to engage in appropriate play. Therefore, he shone like
a divine prince. ||22||  Then, a man named Anga, after approving of Dharma, had
a son named Apa in the city of Shravasti, from a woman named Angika, the wife of
a man named Kampa. ||23||  Kampa was a carpenter, making doors for a living, and
his son was extremely disrespectful. Therefore, he expelled him from the house.
As a result, Apa wandered here and there, filled with fear and sorrow. ||24||
Thereafter, the aforementioned Achal Kumar was dearly loved by his father.
Therefore, his stepmother Dhura's three brothers and the eight sons named
Mukhanta were envious of him and secretly desired to kill him. Achal's mother,
Kanakaprabha, learned of their envy. ||25||  Being desired secretly, he fled,
knowing that his mother was aware of their intentions. In the Tilaka forest, he
was struck by a large thorn. ||26||

The One Hundred and Ninth Chapter 173 Bearing a load of wood, Ap saw him.  He
was standing still, unable to move, groaning in pain. ||27|| Leaving his load of
wood, Ap approached him and removed the thorn with his knife.  He said, "If you
ever hear of a famous Achal, you should go to him without any doubt." ||28|| Ap
went on his way, and the prince Achal, though sorrowful, was resolute and
reached the outskirts of Kaushambi. ||30|| There, in Kaushambi, the son of King
Koshavatsa, Indradatta, was practicing archery.  Hearing the sound of the bow,
Achal went to him. ||31|| Achal had defeated Indradatta's archery teacher,
Vishikacharya.  When King Koshavatsa learned of this, he honored Achal greatly,
welcomed him into the city, and gave him his daughter, Indradatta, in marriage.
||32|| Gradually, through his influence and past good deeds, he became known as
Upadhyaya and then as a king. ||33|| After conquering Anga and other
territories, he came to Mathura, where he set up camp outside the city with his
army. ||34|| The king Chandrabhadga, spreading the word that Achal was a
"murderer of his son," turned all his vassals against him. ||35|| Chandrabhadga
was left alone.  Overwhelmed with sorrow, he sent his three brothers-in-law,
Suryadeva, Abhideva, and Yamunadeva, to negotiate peace. ||36|| Seeing Achal and
recognizing him, they were ashamed and afraid.  They fled, abandoning their
servants and the eight sons of the queen of the earth. ||37|| Achal, reunited
with his mother, celebrated greatly.  He gained a kingdom where all kings bowed
down and which was honored for its virtues. ||38|| 1. Kantakam M. | 2. Atho Kha.

174 Padma Purana Once, a performer of the Natarang came to the city. Seeing him
being beaten by the guards, the king recognized him. || 36 || Calling him to
him, the king gave him the name Aparang and gave him the city of Sravasti as his
birthplace. || 40 || These two friends lived together. One day, they went to the
garden to play, and there they saw the Acharya named Yasho Samudra. Seeing him,
they both attained the state of Nirgrantha. || 41 || Filled with the feeling of
Samyag Darshan, both the monks attained the highest restraint and at the end of
their lives, they died in Samadhi and became Devas in the heaven of Kamalottara.
|| 42 || Then, that same Achal, due to the remaining merit, descended from
heaven and became the king Shatrughna, who brought joy to the eyes of his
mother, Suprija. || 43 || Gautama Swami says, "O King! Due to the connection of
many births, he has a great affection for Mathura." || 44 || If one takes
shelter in the shade of a house or a tree, or even stays there for a day, one
develops affection for it. || 45 || What to say of the place where one has lived
for many births? This is the way of those who wander in the cycle of birth and
death. || 46 || Aparang's soul, due to the remaining merit, became the famous
and powerful commander of the army, known as Kritanta Vaktra. || 47 || Thus,
these two attained the highest wealth due to the effect of Dharma Arjana. It is
true that those who are devoid of Dharma cannot attain anything that brings
happiness. || 48 || This creature has accumulated sins in many births, so he
should attain purity in the Dharma-tirtha, which destroys the dirt of suffering.
Taking refuge in the Jal-tirtha is useless. || 49 || Thus, this wonderful and
excellent story of Shatrughna, which has come down from the tradition of the
Acharyas, should be known by the wise, so that they may always be devoted to
Dharma. || 50 || 1. Suprijalocanananda: M. J.  2. Dhamaanjanadetau M.

## The 29th Chapter  Seven Nirgrantha Munis, radiant like the sun, traveled and
arrived in Mathurapuri. They were:   1.  Surmanyu 2.  Shrimanyu 3.  Shrinichaya
4.  Sarvasundara 5.  Jayavan 6.  Vinayalalas 7.  Jayamitra  All of them were
known for their impeccable character. They were the sons of Queen Dharani, wife
of King Shrinandan, and were renowned throughout the world for their pure
qualities. They resided in Prabhapura.   These seven Munis, upon witnessing the
arrival of the Devas during the time of Preetikara Muni's Kevalgyan, were
awakened and prepared to engage in Dharma with their father.   King Shrinandan,
the valiant leader, entrusted his kingdom to a one-month-old child named Damar
Mangal and, along with his sons, took initiation from Preetikara Muni.   In due
time, King Shrinandan attained Kevalgyan and entered the Siddhalaya. His sons,
becoming great Munis, were known as the Seven Rishis.   During the rainy season,
when the land was covered with clusters of tubers, these Munis resided under a
banyan tree near Mathurapuri, practicing their Yoga.   The power of their
penance destroyed the epidemic created by Chamarendra, just as a woman who has
been seen by her father-in-law is destroyed.   The fertile lands of Mathura,
drenched by heavy clouds, were abundant with crops that grew without being sown
or cultivated.   Free from disease and pestilence, the auspicious city of
Mathura shone brightly, like a new bride, pleased by the sight of her father.
These seven Rishis practiced intense austerities, including various forms of
Rasa Tyaga (renunciation of taste), Vela Tela (fasting), and other forms of
fasting.   They traversed vast distances, covering the sky in the blink of an
eye, and performed their Parana (breaking of fast) in distant cities like
Vijayapura and Podanapura.

## The Twenty-ninth Chapter  177  www  The excellent Muni-Rajas, having received
alms in their hand-held bowls from other houses, consumed them only for the
sustenance of their bodies. ||14||  On one day, when the sun was in the middle
of the sky, those great, peaceful Muni-Rajas, looking at the measure of the
earth, entered the city of Ayodhya. ||15||  With the intention of receiving pure
alms, and with their long arms hanging down, those Muni-Rajas, following the
proper procedure, reached the house of the Arha-Hatta Seth. ||16||  Seeing those
Muni-Rajas, the Arha-Hatta Seth, without any confusion, started thinking: "Where
is this rainy season, and where is this conduct of the Muni-Rajas?" ||17||  In
the caves of the Prag-Bhar mountain, on the banks of the river, at the roots of
trees, in empty houses, in the Jinalaya, and in other places, wherever the Muni-
Rajas are situated, those Muni-Rajas, who possess excellent conduct, do not
wander around without completing the year-long vow, thus negating the time.
||18-19||  But these Muni-Rajas are contradicting the meaning of the Agamas,
they are devoid of knowledge, they are without teachers, and they are corrupt in
their conduct. Therefore, they are wandering around here at this time. ||20||
Although those Muni-Rajas had arrived at an inappropriate time, the daughter-in-
law of the Arha-Hatta Seth, who was devoted and receptive to their intentions,
satisfied them by offering them food. ||21||  After taking food, they went to
the temple of the Arhant Bhagavan, which was filled with Muni-Rajas of pure and
virtuous conduct, where the image of Sri Muni-Suvrat Bhagavan, who brings joy to
the three worlds, was enshrined. ||22||  Then, the Sri Dhuti-Bhattaraka, who was
present in the temple, saw those excellent Muni-Rajas, who were walking four
angulas above the earth, possessing supernatural powers. ||23||  Those Muni-
Rajas, with great faith, entered the Jinalaya on foot, and the Dhuti-Bhattaraka,
standing up, worshipped them according to the proper procedure, including bowing
down. ||24||  Knowing that "our Acharya is eager to worship whoever he wants,"
the disciples of the Dhuti-Bhattaraka thought of criticizing those seven Rishis.
||25||  After that, those seven Rishis, who were devoted to proper praise,
worshipped the Jinendra Bhagavan, and then flew back to their own place through
the sky. ||26||  Knowing that those Muni-Rajas were Charana-Shramanas, the other
Muni-Rajas, who were disciples of the Dhuti-Bhattaraka, became filled with good
thoughts, thinking about their own criticism. ||27||  They were performing the
Parana. ||13||  1. Shalinah M. 2. Nandanam M. Vandanam Kh. 23-3

## The 29th Chapter  There, the one who had attained the highest state of right
faith, was eager to perform the worship of the monks with full effort, after
having established the right faith. ||42|| The hermitage, adorned with drinking
water facilities, playhouses, music halls, and other amenities, became as
beautiful as a heavenly abode. ||43|| Hearing this news, Shatrughna, the fourth
son of King Dasharatha, mounted his mighty steed and went to the presence of the
seven sages. ||44|| Filled with utmost devotion to the monks and overflowing
with love for her son, his mother, Suprija, also went there with her treasury.
||45|| Then, with a devout heart and joy, Shatrughna bowed to the monks who had
completed their vows and requested them to break their fast. ||46|| The chief
monk said, "O noble king! Monks do not partake of food that is prepared for them
with a specific intention." ||47|| "The penance of a yogi is nourished by the
food that is not self-obtained, not obtained through others, and not approved of
by the mind. It is obtained according to the rules." ||48|| Then Shatrughna
said, "O great monks! You are kind to those who seek your blessings. Therefore,
you should be pleased to stay in my city for some time." ||49|| "By your
presence, this city will be prosperous in all ways, just as a lotus blooms in
all directions after the rain has ceased." ||50|| "This city will be filled with
happiness and abundance for the people living here." ||51|| Saying this,
Shatrughna, filled with faith, pondered, "When will I be able to offer the
desired food to the monks, free from any flaws, according to the rules?" ||52||
Then, seeing Shatrughna with his head bowed, the great monk, Gautam Swami,
explained to him the influence of time. ||53|| He said, "When the time of the
Tirthankaras passes in sequence, there will be a terrible time here, devoid of
righteousness and good deeds." ||54|| "This highly elevated Jain religion will
be obscured by wicked hypocrites, just as the sun's disc is obscured by dust
particles." ||55||

In the Padma Purana, Villages will be like cremation grounds, cities like the
realm of the dead, and countries will be filled with misery, scorned and wicked.
||56|| This world will be constantly overrun by cruel, wicked heretics, engaged
in evil deeds like thieves. ||57|| The earth will be filled with wicked people
and impoverished householders, and thousands of sorrows related to violence will
constantly be experienced here. ||58|| Sons will be devoid of affection for
their parents, and parents for their sons, and in the Kali Yuga, kings will be
like thieves, stealing wealth. ||59|| Even though some people will be happy,
they will have evil in their hearts and will play with each other through
stories that lead to misery, thus deceiving each other. ||60|| O Shatrughna!
When the time of abundant passions arrives, all extraordinary things like the
attainment of heaven will be destroyed. ||61|| People, filled with great
delusion, will be disgusted upon seeing the virtuous ones, those who wear the
form of the liberated, adorned with vows and qualities. ||62|| Thinking the
inappropriate to be appropriate, many wicked people will fall into the clutches
of fear, like moths falling into fire. ||63|| Many foolish people, eager to
laugh, will scorn the peaceful-hearted virtuous ones and will diligently provide
food for the foolish. ||64|| Thus, rejecting the virtuous ones, they will
approach the deceitful ones, and with evil intentions, they will give food to
the deceitful ones. ||65|| Just as a seed placed on a stone, even if watered
constantly, is useless and does not bear fruit, so too is the charity of
householders to those without virtue. ||66|| The householder who, disregarding
the monks, gives food to another householder, is like a fool who abandons
sandalwood and takes a bitter fruit. ||67|| Knowing this, the time of wickedness
and evil has arrived, do something good and permanent for your own benefit.
||68|| You are a man of name, therefore, resolve to give alms to the homeless
monks. This is the essence of your wealth. ||69|| O King! In the future, giving
alms to the weary monks will be a great refuge, equal to giving your own home.

## The 29th Chapter  Therefore, O son, give this donation and now embrace the
vows of a householder. Make your life meaningful. || 71 || May the people of
Mathura be devoted to the right path, filled with compassion and affection, and
imbued with the spirit of the Jina's teachings. || 72 || Let Jina images be
established in every home, worshipped, and adorned with abhisheka. Let the
people be protected according to the rules. || 73 || O Shatrughna, diligently
establish images of the Seven Sages in the four directions of the city. By doing
so, there will be peace. || 74 || From today onwards, in any house where there
is no Jina image, the Mari will devour it just as a tigress devours an orphaned
deer. || 75 || In the house where even a thumb-sized image of the Jina is
present, the Mari will not enter, just as a serpent is afraid of Garuda. || 76
||   Having said, "As you command," Shatrughna, filled with joy, the virtuous
ones, desiring the good, ascended into the sky. || 77 || Then, after
circumambulating the Nirvana realms, the monks descended into Janaki's house,
seeking auspiciousness. || 78 || Sita, filled with great joy and adorned with
virtues like faith, offered them a parana with the best food, according to the
rules. || 79 || Having eaten the food offered by Janaki with devotion, filled
with all virtues, the monks gave their blessings and departed. || 80 ||   Then,
Shatrughna established images of the Jina, unparalleled in their beauty, both
inside and outside the city. || 81 || He also established images of the Seven
Sages, with beautiful features, made of wood, in the four directions, to ward
off all evils. || 82 || He established a new city, which seemed as if it were
created on top of heaven. It was beautiful from all sides, vast, free from all
troubles, three yojanas in extent, three times as large on all sides, vast,
circular in shape, and possessed of excellent radiance. || 83-84 || The earth
there was beautiful, with roots that extended to the netherworld, and it was
like a large, beautiful house. || 85 ||

In the Padma Purana, The gardens were adorned with an abundance of flowers and
fruits. The ponds were covered with lotuses and lilies, and resounded with the
songs of birds. ||86|| The palaces, resembling the peaks of Kailasa, were
adorned with beautiful features and were as radiant as the eyes. ||87|| All the
inhabitants were wealthy with gold, grains, and jewels, and were comparable to
the Sammed Shikhar. They were renowned like kings and highly praiseworthy.
||88|| The kings were endowed with unparalleled wealth, like the gods. They were
always devoted to dharma, artha, and kama, and were skilled in performing
virtuous deeds. ||89|| Shatrughna, a wise man, ruled over the city of Mathura,
fulfilling the wishes of the kings, just as Varuna rules over the gods. ||90||
182 Arya Giti Chhandah Gautama Swami says that whoever hears or narrates the
story of the seven sages residing in Mathura and their miraculous influence,
will soon attain all four types of auspiciousness. ||61|| Those who are always
devoted to the company of the virtuous, attain all their desires. Therefore, O
virtuous ones! Embrace the company of the virtuous and shine like the sun.
||62|| Thus ends the 62nd chapter of the Padma Purana, narrated by Acharya
Ravishena, titled "Mathurapuri Nivesha Rishi Dana Guna Upa Sarga Hanana", which
describes the residence of the seven sages in Mathura, their gifts, virtues, and
the destruction of evil influences. ||62|| 1. Ratnaadya: M.

## The Thirty-Ninth Chapter  And in the south of the Vijay mountain, there is a
city called Ratnapura. There, the king of the Vidyadharas, Ratnaratha, rules.
||3|| He has a beautiful daughter named Manorama, born from the womb of his
queen, who is known as Purnacandranana. ||2|| Seeing his daughter's blossoming
youth, the wise king became deeply concerned about finding a suitable husband
for her. ||3|| He discussed this matter with his ministers, pondering, "To whom
should we give this princess?" ||4|| As days passed and the king remained
troubled, Narada arrived and was received with honor. ||5|| Knowing the desires
of all beings, the king, seated comfortably, spoke to Narada. ||6|| "O Narada,
do you not know Langala Lakshmana, the brother of the great man of this age, Sri
Rama?" ||7|| "He possesses the greatest Lakshmi, is adorned with beautiful
qualities, and has subdued all his enemies through the power of his chakra."
||8|| "This princess, like the moonlight to the lotus, is a source of joy to the
heart, and she is a perfect match for him." ||9|| As Narada spoke these words,
the sons of Ratnaratha, filled with pride, anger, and a desire for revenge,
became enraged. ||10|| Remembering the deep hatred born from the killing of
their kin, they flared up like flames of a funeral pyre, their bodies trembling
with fury. ||11|| "We must kill that wicked man immediately, and we will not
give him our sister!" ||12||  Driven by the anger of the princes, the servants
tried to seize Narada, but he quickly ascended into the sky and flew to Ayodhya,
where he respectfully approached Lakshmana. ||13-14|| First, Narada recounted
the affairs of the world to Lakshmana in detail, and then...

In the Padma Purana, a captivating picture of the maiden was depicted,
captivating the mind and heart. It seemed as if the beauty of the three worlds
was combined to create her.  ||16||  Gazing at her, Lakshmana, whose eyes were
as steady as clay idols, was overcome by desire, even though he was a valiant
warrior. ||17|| He thought to himself, "If I do not obtain this jewel of a
woman, then my kingdom is futile and my life is empty." ||18|| With respect,
Lakshmana said to Narada, "O Lord, why did those princes grieve you by
describing my virtues?" ||16|| "I will destroy the arrogance of those wicked,
insignificant men who do not consider the consequences of their actions and are
devoid of hearts." ||20|| "O great sage, the dust from the blow they struck has
become pure by resting on your head. I consider that blow to have been struck on
my head. Therefore, may you be well." ||21|| Saying this, Lakshmana, filled with
anger, summoned the king of the Vidyadharas, Viravitha, and said, "I must
quickly attack Ratnapura." ||22|| "Therefore, show me the way."  Upon hearing
this, Viravitha, the valiant warrior who obeyed orders strictly, wrote letters
and summoned all the Vidyadhara kings. ||23||  Then, the rulers of the cities on
the mountains of Mahendra, Vindhya, Kishkindha, and Malaya, covering the sky
with their flying chariots, arrived in Ayodhya. ||24|| Surrounded by a vast army
of those Vidyadhara kings, Lakshmana, with Ramachandra in front of him, marched
towards victory, just as the gods march surrounded by the Lokapalas. ||25||
Kings, adorned with white umbrellas and whose armies had obscured the sun's rays
with their various weapons, reached Ratnapura. ||26|| Upon learning of the
approaching army, the king of Ratnapura, skilled in warfare, marched out with
all his vassals. ||27|| As soon as the king, who possessed great speed, emerged,
the entire southern army was overwhelmed in an instant. ||28|| Then, a fierce
battle ensued, fueled by arrogance, with weapons like chakras, krakacha, arrows,
swords, spears, nooses, and maces. ||26||

## The Thirty-Ninth Chapter  The Apsaras, arranged in the sky in appropriate
places, showered flower offerings in places filled with wonder. ||30|| Then, in
the midst of the ocean of warriors, Lakshmana, the great fire, was ready to
expand, destroying the warriors like water creatures. ||31|| Chariots, excellent
horses, and elephants, spewing forth their maddening water, were scattered in
all ten directions, like grass before his speed. ||32|| Rama, wielding the power
of Indra, engaged in playful combat, while Sugriva, the king of Kishkindha,
excelled in the art of war. ||33|| Elsewhere, Hanuman, the hero with the blazing
mane, the fierce-hearted, the wielder of the tail, was performing various
wondrous feats. ||34|| Just as the morning clouds of autumn are scattered by the
wind, so too was the great army of the Vijayardha mountain scattered by these
mighty warriors. ||35|| Then, the kings of the Vijayardha mountain, their
ambitions shattered, fled towards their own places, accompanied by their lord.
||36|| Seeing those valiant sons of Ratnaratha fleeing, Narada, the lover of
strife, filled with utmost anger, made a loud sound, clapping his hands in the
sky. ||37-38|| "Ah! These are the fickle, angry, wicked, and foolish sons of
Ratnaratha, who fled, unable to bear the excellence of Lakshmana's qualities.
||39|| O humans! Seize these arrogant ones by force! Having disrespected me
then, where are you fleeing now?" ||40|| Upon hearing this, many valiant heroes,
who had achieved victory and were renowned for their prowess, set out to capture
them. ||41|| As they approached, the city of Ratnapura became like a forest
engulfed in a great fire. ||42|| At that time, there was a beautiful maiden, a
jewel in herself, surrounded by her friends, who delighted the hearts of all who
saw her. ||43||

Panpuraana Mounted on a chariot adorned with a garland of flowers, overwhelmed
by great love, he approached Saumitri, like Pauloma approaching Vidojas. ||4||
Then, accompanied by those who offered him gifts, Lakshmana, having obtained the
gift, became free from all impurities, his face devoid of frowns. ||15|| Then,
along with his sons, whose pride had been extinguished, the king Ratnaratha,
adorned with auspicious offerings, joyfully departed from the city. ||46||
Knowing the laws of time and place, and having witnessed the prowess of both his
own and others, he duly praised Rama and Lakshmana, whose banners bore the
emblems of the lion and the Garuda. ||7|| In the midst of this gathering, amidst
a vast multitude, Narada, with a gentle smile, addressed Ratnaratha, saying, "Oh
Ratnaratha, what news do you bring? Were you a chariot of jewels or a chariot of
dust? You were boasting about your great warriors, so how are you now?"
||48-49|| "It seems that you are not the same Ratnaratha, the mountain of pride,
but some other king, devoted to the service of the feet of Narayana." ||50||
Then, making a sound of laughter and clapping his hands, he said, "Oh, sons of
Ratnaratha, are you well?" ||51|| "This is the same Narayana, about whom you,
with your arrogant behavior in your own home, spoke words that gripped the
heart." ||52|| "Even though this is true, we are grateful to you, Narada, for
this is the fruit of your anger, that we have been blessed with the rare
opportunity to meet such great men." ||53|| Thus, with these humorous tales,
they lingered for a moment, and then, with great splendor, they all entered the
city. ||54|| At that time, a maiden named Shridhama, whose beauty was like that
of Rati, and who delighted even the gods, was given to Rama. Obtaining such a
woman, Rama, whose influence was like that of Mount Meru, and who had taken her
hand in marriage, was overjoyed. ||55|| Then, King Ratnaratha, for the sake of
Lakshmana, who was destined to destroy Dashaasya, gave birth to Manorama. The
story of these two is a tale of great fortune. ||56|| Manorama, the maiden,
approached Lakshmana in the same way that Indrani approaches Indra. ||43-44||
Having obtained this maiden, who was accompanied by those who offered her gifts,
and who herself was worthy of receiving gifts, Lakshmana's impurities were
cleansed, and his face became free of frowns. ||45|| After that, King
Ratnaratha, whose pride had been extinguished, who knew the laws of time and
place, who had witnessed the prowess of both his own and others, and who was
adorned with auspicious offerings, joyfully departed from the city along with
his sons. ||46-47|| In the midst of this gathering, amidst a vast multitude,
Narada, with a gentle smile, addressed Ratnaratha, saying, "Oh Ratnaratha, what
news do you bring? Were you a chariot of jewels or a chariot of dust? You were
boasting about your great warriors, so how are you now?" ||48-49|| "It seems
that you are not the same Ratnaratha, the mountain of pride, but some other

## Chapter Forty-Nine  Other celestial beings in the southern range of the
Vijayardha mountain, who were shrouded in darkness of weapons, were subdued by
Lakshmana. ||1|| Those celestial beings, who were previously as formidable as
great serpents, became free from the poison of pride and became servants of
Rama. ||2|| O King! I will now tell you some of the names of those cities, which
possess brilliance like that of heaven. Listen. ||3|| The cities are: Ravinibha,
Vahniprabha, Kanchana, Megha, Shivamandira, Gandharvagita, Amritapura,
Lakshmidhara, Kinnarodgita, Jimutashikhara, Martyanugita, Chakrapura,
Rathanupura, Bahurava, Malaya, Shrigriha, Bhaskarabha, Ariñjaya, Jyotipura,
Shashichhaya, Gandhara, Malaya, Singhapura, Shrivijayapura, Yakshapura, and
Tilakapura. O Purushottama! Lakshmana, the great soul, subdued these and many
other excellent cities. ||4-6|| Thus, Lakshmana, the handsome, subdued the
entire earth and, adorned with seven treasures, attained the complete state of
Narayana. ||10|| The seven treasures, Chakra, Chatra, Dhanush, Shakti, Gada,
Mani, and Khadga, were obtained by Lakshmana. ||11|| [Similarly, the four
treasures, Hal, Musala, Gada, and Ratnamala, were obtained by Rama.] Then, the
king Shrenika said to Gautama Swami, "O Bhagavan! By your grace, I have learned
the greatness of Rama and Lakshmana according to the scriptures. Now, I wish to
know the origin of Lavanaṅkusha and the birth of Lakshmana's sons. You are
worthy of telling me." ||12-13||   Then, the lord of the assembly of sages, Shri
Gautama Ganadhara, said in a loud voice, "O King! Listen, I will tell you the
story you desire." ||14|| Rama and Lakshmana, the principal men of the age, were
born with the enjoyment of a vast kingdom, free from thorns, and were devoted to
the great happiness granted by the god Dodundaka. Thus, their days, fortnights,
months, years, and yugas passed. ||15-16||

The Forty-Ninth Chapter 18|| There were seventeen thousand women in Lakshmana's
retinue, who were equal to the celestial nymphs and born in noble families.

the fourth, Kalyanamala, then the fifth, Ratimala, who was like unto Ratimala in
beauty, then the sixth, Jitapdma, who had conquered the lotus with her mouth,

were like unto the celestial nymphs. Among them were four Mahadeviyas, who were
renowned throughout the world. ||24|| The first was Sita, the second,
Prabhavati, the third, Ratinibha, and the fourth, Shridhama. ||25|| Among all
these, Sita, with her beautiful features, shone like the moon among the stars.

names. Listen! ||27|| Vrishabha, Dharana, Chandra, Sarabha, Makaradhvaja,
Dharana, Harinaga, Shridhara, Madana and Achyuta. ||28|| Among these sons, there
were eight chief princes, who were endowed with beautiful movements, and whose
virtues attracted men, who became devoted to them. ||26|| The first was
Shridhara, the son of Vishalya-Sundari, who shone in Ayodhya like the moon in
the sky. ||30|| The son of Rupavati was known as Prithivitalaka, who was
renowned throughout the earth, and who carried the radiance of the earth. ||31||
The son of Kalyanamala was known as Mangala, who was the recipient of many
blessings, and who was always eager to perform auspicious rites. ||32|| The son

In the Padma Purana,  King Ativirya's daughter, Srikeshi, gave birth to a son
named Srikeshi.   The son of Bhagavati was known as Satyakiriti. ||3|| Manorama
had a son named Supaashvakiriti. ||34|| All these princes were very powerful and
skilled in both weapons and scriptures. ||35|| Their brotherhood was as strong
as flesh and bone, and their righteous conduct was praised everywhere. ||36||
They were close to each other's hearts, their minds filled with love. These
eight princes, like the eight Vasus in heaven, enjoyed themselves in their city
as they pleased. ||37|| Gautama Swami says that the actions of beings who have
accumulated merit in previous lives and whose minds are filled with good
intentions are always beautiful from birth. ||38|| Thus, in that city, there
were a total of four and a half crore princes, renowned for their extraordinary
power and extremely beautiful. ||38-36|| There were sixteen thousand kings,
dwelling in various countries, adorned with crowns on their heads, and whose
brilliance was like the sun, who served the feet of Rama and Lakshmana. ||40||
Thus ends the ninety-ninth chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the Arsha,
narrated by Acharya Srivishena, which describes the glories of Rama and
Lakshmana. ||64||

## The Fifty-ninth Chapter  Thus, as the days passed, filled with the enjoyment
of worldly pleasures and deeply engaged in the pursuit of Dharma, Artha, and
Kama, [1] Janaki, sleeping comfortably in her palace, resembling a celestial
chariot, [2] on a bed as soft as a garland of autumn clouds, [3] saw a dream in
the last watch of the night, her lotus-like eyes closed. She was awakened by the
auspicious sounds of divine instruments. [4]   Then, as the morning dawned, pure
and bright, filled with doubts, Janaki, having performed her daily rituals, went
to her beloved, accompanied by her friends. [5] She asked, "My Lord, O learned
one, I have seen a dream. You are worthy to interpret its meaning." [6]  "I saw
two magnificent Ashtapadas, their radiance like the autumn moon, their sound
like a churning ocean, their form like the peak of Kailasa, adorned with all
ornaments. Their noble tusks were white and radiant, and their beautiful manes
were adorned. I believe these two noble Ashtapadas entered my mouth." [7-8]
"Then, in another dream, I saw myself falling from the peak of the Pushpaka
chariot, driven by the wind, like a banner, and landing on the earth." [9]
Padmanabha then said, "O blessed one, seeing a pair of Ashtapadas signifies that
you will soon have two sons." [10]  "My dear, though falling from the front of
the Pushpaka chariot is not auspicious, do not worry. By performing acts of
peace and charity, the planets of misfortune will be pacified." [11]  Then,
Spring arrived, adorned with a garland of flowers, riding on an elephant made of
Kadamba trees, wielding a bow made of mango wood, armed with arrows made of
lotus, carrying a quiver full of Bakul flowers, his glory sung by a chorus of
pure-toned bumblebees. He breathed the fragrant air of Kadamba trees, as if he
were sighing, and laughed at his enemies, as if illuminated by the light of
Malati flowers. He sang sweetly, like a cuckoo, with his melodious voice.

In the Padma Purana, The spring season, adorned with the beauty of the king,
causing agitation in the world, was engaged in pleasant conversation. ||14|| Its
nails were Angkot flowers, it wore a Kurvak beard, its eyes were red Ashoka
flowers, its tongue was a fluttering bud, it had acquired supreme fear in the
minds of foreign people, and its neck hair was Bakul flowers. Such a spring lion
arrived. ||15-16|| The Mahendrodaya garden of Ayodhya was beautiful by nature,
but at that time, due to spring, it became as beautiful as Nandanvana. ||17||
Trees with various colorful flowers blooming and various types of leaves
swaying, were as if mad, whirling in the face of the south wind. ||18|| The
ponds, covered with lotuses, blue lotuses, etc., were filled with the sounds of
flocks of birds, and their banks were served by people, were shining brightly.
||19|| The melodious sounds of swans, cranes, ducks, cuckoos, and carandas
birds, which were difficult for passionate people to bear, began to be heard.
||20|| The pure water, agitated by their falling and rising, was becoming
turbulent, as if filled with joy. ||21|| In the expansion of spring, the water
was filled with lotuses, etc., the land with Kurvaks, etc., and the sky with
their pollen. ||22|| At that time, clusters, shrubs, creepers, and trees, all
kinds of plant species, were situated in various ways, achieving supreme beauty
from all sides. ||23|| At that time, seeing Janakanandini, whose body was
somewhat weakened by the fatigue caused by the womb, Rama asked, "O beloved!
What do you like? Tell me. I will fulfill your desire. Why are you becoming like
this?" ||24-25|| Then, Sita, with a lotus-like face, smiled and said, "O Lord! I
wish to see many temples situated on the earth." ||26|| My desire is to
respectfully bow down to the five-colored images of the Jinas, whose form is
auspicious for the three worlds. ||27|| My great faith is to worship the Jina
with golden and jeweled flowers. What else do I desire? ||28||

The Fifty-ninth Festival  Hearing this, Padmaabha, with a smiling face and full
of joy, addressed the doorkeeper, who had bowed down at that moment, saying, "O
Kalyani! Tell the minister to make arrangements without delay. Let there be a
grand celebration in the Jinalayas." (26-30)  Let all the people, with great
respect, go to the Mahendrodya Garden and adorn the Jina temples. (31)  Let them
perform Jina worship throughout the world with toranas, flags, bells, lamboos,
spheres, crescent moons, canopies, very beautiful clothes, and all other very
beautiful equipment. (32-33)  Let the temples of Nirvana Dhamas be decorated
especially, and let great joys, accompanied by all wealth, be initiated. (34)
The Vaideyas, who perform the puja in them, are auspicious and beneficial. I
will wander with her, increasing the glory of the Jina Dharma. (35)  Having been
instructed by her, the doorkeeper, appointing another woman like herself, told
the minister as instructed. The minister, in turn, immediately instructed his
servants. (36)  Then, those servants, with great zeal and joy, quickly went and
decorated the Jina temples. (37)  In the temples, whose grand entrances were
like the caves of great mountains, full kalasas, adorned with garlands and other
ornaments, were installed. (38)  On the wide walls of the temples, made of gold,
were spread beautiful paintings, attracting the mind with their gem-like
designs. (39)  On the pillars were placed very pure and clear mirrors made of
gems, and in front of the windows hung beautiful garlands, like clear
waterfalls. (40)  Various designs were drawn on the ground where people's feet
touched, with beautiful gem-like powder of five colors. (41)  Lotuses, with one
hundred or one thousand petals, and with long stems, were placed on the
thresholds of the temples and in other places. (42)  In places accessible to the
hand, a network of tinkling bells was installed, making a sound like that of a
lustful woman. (43)  Pattalambhoos, adorned with five colors, with variegated,
shining, and beautiful mandidandakas, were hung loosely. (44)

In the Padma Purana, Numerous, extremely beautiful, and diverse garlands were
spread out, attracting bees with their fragrance. These were crafted by the
finest artisans. ||45|| The garden was adorned with numerous, grand musical
halls and spectator galleries. ||46|| Thus, with such extremely beautiful and
vast splendors, the Mahendrodya garden became as beautiful as Nandana. ||47||
**Arya Chanda** **16.4** Then, accompanied by the citizens of his kingdom, the
Asura king, and the goddesses, Padma, along with Sita, went to the garden,
accompanied by all his ministers. ||48|| Padma, seated on a magnificent
elephant, with Sita by his side, shone brightly, just as Indra, the lord of the
gods, shines on the back of Airavata with Sachi. ||49|| Similarly, Narayana,
carrying the supreme prosperity, went forth, while the rest of the people,
always joyful, elated, and blessed with abundant food and drink, followed.
||50|| The goddesses resided in the beautiful Kadali houses and the delightful,
open-roofed arbors, with great splendor, while the other people sat comfortably
in their respective places. ||51|| Descending from the elephant, Rama, like
Indra in the ocean of milk, joyfully played in the lake, filled with lotuses and
blue lotuses, vast like the ocean, with pure water. ||52|| After playing in the
lake for a long time, they plucked flowers, emerged from the water, and, with
divine materials for worship, worshipped the Jina, along with Sita. ||53|| The
charming Rama, surrounded by the most excellent women, resembling the forest
goddesses, shone brightly, as if the embodied spring had arrived. ||54||

The Ninety-Fifth Chapter 165 Surrounded by eight thousand incomparable
goddesses, the pure-bodied Rama was shining like the moon surrounded by stars.
||55|| In that garden, Rama enjoyed the supreme pleasures of sound, taste, form,
fragrance, and touch, arising from ambrosial food, unguents, beds, seats,
dwellings, perfumes, and garlands. ||56|| Thus, the radiant Rama, adorned with
excellent women, became deeply attached to the daily worship and rituals
performed in the Jina temple. ||57|| Thus ends the Ninety-Fifth Chapter of the
Padma Purana, known as the Arsha, narrated by Acharya Sri Ravishena, describing
the Jina-worship in the form of Dohas. ||65|| 1.  Apa + Udharam.

## The Sixth Canto  **1.** Thus, with a pure heart, Rama was situated in the
garden called Mahendrodudaya. The people, as if thirsty, approached him,
desiring his darshan.  **2.** The news of the people's arrival was conveyed to
Sita by the doorkeepers, following tradition. As soon as Sita heard this news,
her right eye twitched.  **3.** Sita thought, "What does this twitching eye
below signify for me? It must be a sign of some great sorrow coming my way."
**4.** "The wicked fate has caused me sorrow in the midst of the ocean. It seems
he is not satisfied with that, I wonder what else he will bring upon me?"
**5.** "The fruits of the actions performed by living beings, which are created
by themselves, are inevitable. It is impossible to prevent them."  **6.** "Just
as the sun, though nurtured by the moon, constantly consumes it with its own
heat, so too, one constantly experiences the fruits of their actions."  **7.**
"Oh, wise goddesses! You have heard the scriptures. Please consider carefully
and tell me what is the fruit of this twitching of my lower eyelid."  **8.**
Among those goddesses, there was one named Anumati, who was skilled in making
decisions. She said, "Oh, goddess! What other law is there to be seen in this
world?"  **9.** "Whatever action was performed in the past, whether good or bad,
is called Krtaanta, Vidhi, Daiva, or Ishvara."  **10.** "To say that I have been
brought to this state by the separate Krtaanta is a statement based on
ignorance."  **11.** Then, another goddess named Gunamala, who knew the virtues
and vices, spoke to the sorrowful Sita, comforting her. "Oh, goddess! You are
the most beloved of the Lord, and it is through your grace that others find
happiness."  **12.** "Therefore, even with a careful mind, I cannot see any
reason for sorrow that will befall you, who are so virtuous."

## The Sixteenth Chapter  The other goddesses there asked, "What is the use of
this lengthy debate, Devi? Let peace be established through a grand ceremony."
|| 14 || "Let there be abhishekas (consecrations) of the Jinas, generous pujas
(worship), and dana (charity) given with a desire to fulfill the wishes of the
recipients. Let the inauspicious karma be eradicated." || 15 ||   Hearing this,
Sita Devi said, "You have spoken well, goddesses. Dana, puja, abhisheka, and
tapas (austerity) are all destroyers of inauspicious karma." || 16 || "Dana
destroys obstacles, removes enmity from enemies, brings about the accumulation
of punya (merit), and leads to great fame." || 17 ||   Saying this, Sita called
for Bhadrakalasha, the treasurer, and said, "Let dana be given to the expectant
mothers every day, whatever they desire." || 18 ||   "As you command," said the
treasurer and went away. Sita, engrossed in the reverence for the Jinas and
their worship, remained there. || 19 ||   Then, in the houses of the Jinas, the
sounds of musical instruments arose, a mixture of conch shells and trumpets,
resembling the roar of thunder during the rainy season. || 20 ||   Pictures
depicting the lives of the Jinas were displayed, and kalashas filled with milk,
ghee, and other offerings were brought. || 21 ||   A man adorned with ornaments,
riding an elephant, and wearing white clothes, announced in Ayodhya, "Who
desires what?" || 22 ||   Thus, dana was given with great enthusiasm, following
proper procedures. Devi Sita, with her own power, established various rules. ||
23 ||   Grand pujas and abhishekas were performed with great splendor. People,
freed from the burden of sin, became peaceful and calm. || 24 ||   While Sita,
with a peaceful mind, was engaged in these activities, Ramachandra, powerful
like Indra, sat in the assembly hall. || 25 ||   The gatekeepers, having opened
the gates, were anxious. The people of the city, fearing as if they were going
to the lion's den, entered the assembly hall. || 26 ||   Seeing the magnificent
assembly hall, built of jewels and gold, something they had never seen before,
the minds of the people were stirred. || 27 ||

In the Padma Purana, seeing Rama, who brings joy to the heart and celebration to
the eyes, the people, their minds elated, folded their hands in salutation.
||28|| Seeing the people, their bodies trembling, their minds repeatedly
shaking, Padma said, "O noble ones! Tell me the reason for your arrival." ||29||
Then Vijay, Suraji, Madhuman, Vasula, Dhara, Kashyap, Pingala, Kala, Kshema, and
other great men, overwhelmed by the king's influence, could not speak. They
stood still, their eyes fixed on his feet, their vigor gone. ||30-31|| Although
their intellect was eager to speak for a long time, their speech, like a bride,
did not emerge from the house of their mouths with great difficulty. ||32|| Then
Padma, with comforting words, spoke again, "Welcome, tell me the purpose for
which you have come." ||33|| Even after being told this, they remained devoid of
all senses. Standing still, they seemed as if a skilled craftsman had created
them as clay toys and placed them there. ||34|| Their throats bound by the
fetter of shame, their eyes somewhat restless like the young of deer, their
hearts deeply troubled, those people were devoid of joy, their faces pale.
||35|| Then the leader among them, speaking in broken words, said, "O God! Grant
us protection and be pleased." ||36|| Then King Ramachandra said, "O noble men!
You have nothing to fear, reveal what is in your hearts and attain peace."
||37|| "I now abandon all sin and accept the pure, just as a swan, abandoning
mixed water, accepts only milk." ||38|| Then, even after obtaining protection,
Vijay, who had difficulty stabilizing his words, folded his hands and said in a
soft voice, "O Lord! O Rama! O best of men! Hear my request. All the people have
now become devoid of righteousness." ||39-40|| This human world, by its very
nature, is very deceitful. Having seen a clear example, nothing is difficult for
it. ||41||

## The Nineteenth Chapter  193  **42.** The monkey is naturally very fickle.
What to say if it is mounted on a cage-like, fickle machine?  **43.** Young
women, endowed with beauty, are abducted by wicked-minded, strong men from those
who are weak.  **44.** A man, deeply distressed by the separation from his
virtuous beloved, brings her back home with the help of someone.  **45.** O
Lord! Until the earth is destroyed, let some remedy be devised for the welfare
of the people, as Dharma and its principles are fading away.  **46.** In rivers,
gardens, assemblies, villages, resting places, roads, cities, and houses, there
is no other talk except this one, "Avarnavada."  **47.** King Dasharatha's son
Rama, well-versed in all scriptures, brought back Janaki, abducted by the king
of the Vidyadharas.  **48.** There is no fault in adopting such conduct, for the
wise are the supreme authority for the world.  **49.** Moreover, whatever the
king does, the same is done by us, his followers.  **50.** O Kakutstha! Thus,
wicked-minded men are roaming freely on earth. Subdue them.  **51.** If this one
fault had not been in your kingdom, it would have delayed even Indra's empire.
**52.** Hearing this, the king was struck by a moment of sorrow, his heart
greatly agitated by the blow of the mace of grief.  **53.** He thought, "Alas!
This great misfortune has befallen me. The fire of disgrace has ignited to burn
my lotus-like fame."  **54.** The very act that caused me unbearable pain of
separation, is now staining my lineage, my family's moon.  **55.** The virtuous
Sita, whom the valiant monkeys, aiming at her, made impure, is the same Sita who
is the moon of my lineage.  **56.** If a suitable example is found, then nothing
is difficult for one who is inherently crooked.  **41.** The monkey is naturally
very fickle. What to say if it is mounted on a cage-like, fickle machine?

In the Padma Purana, It is for this reason that I fought the battle, destroying
my enemies. This Janaki, the mirror of my lineage, is defiling me. ||5|| The
people rightly say that a man who is wicked in his own house, is worthy of
blame. Why did I bring Sita, who is worthy of blame, into my house? ||5|| I
become consumed with longing when I do not see her even for a moment. How can I
abandon this beloved, who is filled with love? ||56|| She resides in my eyes and
mind. How can I abandon Janaki, who is a treasure trove of virtues and without
fault? ||60|| Or, who knows the nature of the minds of women, in whom Kama, the
cause of all faults, resides? ||61|| Shame on that woman, who is the source of
all faults, the cause of suffering, and difficult to abandon for men born of
pure lineage. ||62|| She is the destroyer of all strengths, the refuge of
attachment, the ultimate cause of the destruction of memories, the pit that
causes the fall of truth, the obstacle to the happiness of liberation, the
destroyer of the source of knowledge, like fire covered in ashes, like the
needle of a weaver, or beautiful to behold. Therefore, like a snake shedding its
skin, I abandon Vaidehi, desiring to escape great suffering. ||63-65|| My heart,
bound by the intense bond of love, is always filled with her. How can I abandon
this primary source? ||66|| Although I am steadfast in my resolve, Vaidehi, who
is near, is like a flame, capable of consuming my mind. ||67|| I believe that
just as the line of the moon, though distant, is capable of moving the Kumudini,
so too is this beautiful Sita capable of moving my fortitude. ||68|| On the one
hand, there is public censure, and on the other, love that is difficult to
abandon. Alas! I am caught between fear and desire, trapped in a dense forest.
||69|| She is superior in every way, even to the celestial nymphs. How can I
abandon that virtuous Sita, who has attained unity through love? ||70|| If I do
not abandon her, I will be publicly disgraced. There is no one on earth like me
in this regard.

## The Ninety-Ninth Chapter  **201**  **Vasantatilaka Vrittam**  The mind of
Rama, bound by the intense force of mixed emotions, filled with love, reproach,
and fear, was overwhelmed by deep sorrow. That time was an unparalleled torment
for him. ||72||  **Vamsasthavrittam**  His thoughts were filled with
contradictions, both past and present, causing immense turmoil. They were devoid
of any stable resolve and filled with the pain of separation. This contemplation
was more unbearable than the midday sun in the summer. ||73||  Thus ends the
Ninety-Ninth Chapter of the Padma Purana, titled "Janaparivaadachinta", narrated
by the revered Acharya, known as Arsha. ||66||  **Notes:**  *
**Janaparivaadachinta:** This refers to the chapter's theme of public criticism
and its impact on Rama. * **Vasantatilaka Vrittam & Vamsasthavrittam:** These
are specific poetic meters used in the verses. * **Arsha:** This is a title
given to the author of the Padma Purana, often attributed to Rishi Vyasa.

## The Seventy-Seventh Chapter  Then, somehow fixing his mind on one thing, Shri
Rama ordered the doorkeeper to call Lakshmana. ||1||  Hearing the doorkeeper's
words, Lakshmana, whose mind was focused on his duties, was filled with anxiety.
He mounted his swift steed and went to Shri Rama. ||2||  Reaching Shri Rama's
presence, he bowed with folded hands and sat on the beautiful earth, his gaze
fixed on his feet. ||3||  Shri Rama, whose body was bent in humility and who was
the epitome of obedience, raised Lakshmana himself and seated him on an ardha-
asana. ||4||  The kings, led by Shatrughna, including Chandrodar and Tut,
entered with permission and sat down in their respective places. ||5||  The
purohit, the city's chief, the ministers, and other noblemen sat down in their
appropriate places, filled with curiosity. ||6||  Then, after standing for a
moment, Balarama, in due course, informed Lakshmana of the slander that had
arisen. ||7||  Hearing this, Sumitra's son, his eyes red with anger, ordered the
warriors to prepare and then spoke again: "Today, I will reach the end of the
ocean of wickedness and cover the earth with the tongues of those who speak
falsely. ||8-9||  I will destroy those who hate the virtuous and profound Sita,
who embodies the perfect character and bears the weight of noble qualities. They
will be reduced to nothing." ||10||  Then, seeing Lakshmana, who was consumed by
anger and had caused turmoil in the assembly, Shri Rama calmed him with these
words: "O gentle one! This earth, extending to the ocean's edge, has been
protected for ages by the best of men, like Lord Rishabhadeva and Bharat
Chakravarti." ||11-12||  Kings like Arka Kirti were the jewels of the Ikshvaku
dynasty. Just as no one can see the back of the moon, so too, their enemies
could not see their backs in battle. ||13||  Their glorious deeds, shining like
a moonlit cloth, adorned the three worlds, leaving no space untouched. ||14||

## Chapter Seventy-Seven 203 How can I, a sinner, defile this lineage for the
sake of mere affection? I would be making my life meaningless and impure. ||15||
Even a small amount of infamy, if ignored, grows. Even a small amount of fame is
used by the gods. ||16|| What is the use of even the most magnificent and
fleeting pleasures when the garden of fame is being burnt by the fire of infamy?
||17|| I know that Devi Sita is virtuous and pure of heart, but as long as she
remains in our house, this slander cannot be dispelled by any weapon or
scripture. ||18|| See, the sun, which brings joy to the lotus grove, sets at
night. Who can stop it? ||19|| My radiance is being diminished by the dust of
slander, which has spread far and wide. Let this not be left unchecked. ||20||
Brother, I am striving to ensure that our lineage, pure as the moon, does not
become clouded by the dark lines of infamy. ||21|| Just as fire, devoid of
water, grows in a pile of dry fuel, so too, let this infamy not grow in the
world. ||22|| This lineage of mine is great, luminous, pure, and radiant. Take
immediate action before it is stained. ||23|| I may abandon Vaidehi, who is
innocent and virtuous, but I will not compromise my fame, which is the source of
happiness for the world. ||24|| Then, Lakshmana, devoted to his brother's love,
said, "O King, you should not grieve over Vaidehi." ||25|| Why are you
abandoning Janaki, who is revered by all virtuous women and is blameless in
every way, just because of the fear of public slander? ||26|| It is the nature
of wicked people to speak ill of the virtuous. Their words do not diminish the
true nature of the virtuous. ||27|| Even if someone with eyes poisoned by venom
sees the moon as completely black, the moon does not lose its true whiteness.
||28|| The soul of a virtuous being attains self-realization. The true nature of
things is not found in external appearances, but in the essence of truth. ||29||
The world is constantly adorned with beauty. ||14||

204 Padma Purana Wise men are not disturbed by the words of ordinary people,
just as an elephant is not ashamed by the barking of a dog. ||30|| This strange
world, which is constantly changing like waves, is addicted to talking about the
faults of others. Its own soul will control it. ||31|| A foolish man who wants
to destroy the moon by digging up a stone will undoubtedly destroy himself.
||32|| A wicked man who is eager to gossip and cannot tolerate the virtues of
others will surely meet with misfortune. ||33|| Then Balarama said, "Lakshmana,
what you are saying is true, and your impartial wisdom is commendable. ||34||
But there is no fault to be seen in a pure-minded man who abandons actions that
are against the welfare of the world. On the contrary, his virtues are evident.
||35|| What happiness can there be in the world for a man whose directions are
engulfed in flames of slander? What hope can he have for life? ||36|| What is
the use of a purpose that creates misfortune? What is the benefit of a medicine
that contains poison? And what is the use of strength that does not protect
creatures who are in fear? ||37|| There is no purpose in a character that does
not make the soul strive for its own good, and what is the benefit of knowledge
that does not lead to the knowledge of the spiritual realm? ||38|| The birth of
a man whose virtuous wife is taken away by a powerful slander is not considered
good. It would be better for him to die. ||39|| Let there be public criticism,
even if it is a great fault of mine. I brought Sita back home after she was
taken away by another man. ||40|| Sita lived in the garden of the demon's palace
for a long time. The messengers, who spoke vile words, begged her for what they
desired. Ravana, who was present in the nearby land, looked at her with evil
eyes many times and spoke to her as he pleased. ||41|| How can I not be ashamed,
or how can it be difficult for fools to bring such a Sita back home? ||43|| It
speaks of its own reality. In reality, the true nature of a thing is sufficient
for its reality, not its external appearance. ||26||

The Seventy-Seventh Chapter 205 Let the commander of the army with the face of
death be called immediately. Sita, who is pregnant, should be taken from my
house today. ||44|| Thus, Lakshmana, with folded hands and a humble heart, said
to the Lord, "O God! It is not right to abandon Janaka's daughter." ||45|| How
can the delicate, innocent, and well-nurtured Sita, whose lotus-like feet are
very soft, go alone through a dangerous path? ||46|| Abandoned by you, the
princess, burdened with pregnancy and overwhelmed with sorrow, will seek refuge
in whom? ||47|| What is wrong with Ravana seeing Sita? In the world, do not
devotees offer even fallen flowers, etc., to the Jina? Therefore, there is no
fault in seeing another. ||48|| O Lord! O Hero! Be pleased. Do not abandon Sita,
who is innocent, who has never seen a needle, who is very delicate, and who has
devoted her heart to you. ||49|| Then Rama, whose hatred had become very strong,
who was burdened with anger, and whose face was displeased, said to his younger
brother, "O Lakshmīdhara! You should not say anything further. I have decided to
do this, whether it is right or wrong." ||50-51|| Sita will be abandoned in a
desolate forest, devoid of any companions. Let her live or die by her own karma.
||52|| Sita, who is a source of sin, will not dwell in my country, or in any
noble city, or in any house, even for a moment. ||53|| Then, mounting a chariot
drawn by four horses, surrounded by his army, and worshipped by his captives
with shouts of "Victory!" and "Joy!", the commander of the army with the face of
death, with a white umbrella raised above his head, armed with a bow, and
adorned with armor and earrings, set out for the king's presence. ||54-55||
Seeing him approaching in this manner, the women of the city, whose minds were
filled with speculation and conjecture, began to discuss the matter in many
ways. ||56|| 1.  Muktvaanjaliṁ M. 2.  Yathā jātu M. 3.  Vane'khilē B.

## Padma Purana  What is this? Why does this one appear hasty? Towards whom is
this one angry? What will happen to whom today? O Mother! This one, who is
situated in the midst of the darkness of weapons and who is endowed with
brilliance like the sun in the summer season, is terrifying like Yama, the lord
of death, with his face like that of Yama. || 57-58 ||  The women of the city,
who were engrossed in this story, saw the commander approaching Rama. || 56 ||
Then, bowing his head to the ground, he saluted the Lord and said with folded
hands, "O Lord! Give me your command." || 60 ||  Rama said, "Go, bring Sita back
quickly. He had expressed a desire to see the Jain temples, so show him the Jain
temples on the way. Show him the group of images, which are built on Sammed
Shikhar, the Nirvana land of the Tirthankaras, and are skilled in fulfilling
desires." || 61-62 ||  After showing him these, take him to the deserted forest
called Singhanada, and leave him there. O gentle one! Come back quickly." || 63
||  Then, without any argument, saying "As you command," the commander went to
Sita and said, "O Devi! Get up, get on the chariot, do your desired work, see
the Jain temples, and achieve the rise of desired fruits." || 64-65 ||  Thus,
Sita, who was being pleased by the commander with sweet words and whose heart
was filled with joy, approached the chariot. || 66 ||  Approaching the chariot,
she said, "May the fourfold Sangha always be victorious, and may Ramachandra,
the Jain devotee, who is devoted to the practice of good conduct, always be
victorious." || 67 ||  "If we have done anything unpleasant due to carelessness,
may the gods residing in the Jain temples forgive all my offenses." || 68 ||
Sita, who had a very eager heart, said to all her friends with a heart attached
to her husband, "O good friends! Stay happily. I will go and pay my respects to
the Jain temples, and I will come back soon. There is no great eagerness..." ||

The Seventy-Seventh Chapter 107 Thus, after being told by Sita and due to the
absence of her husband's order, the other women, who were eloquent, did not
express their desire to accompany her. ||7|| Then, after paying obeisance to the
Siddhas, Sita, with a cheerful face, mounted the radiant chariot, having
attained supreme joy. ||72|| Mounted on that chariot, adorned with jewels and
gold, she shone like a celestial damsel adorned with a garland of jewels, riding
on a celestial chariot. ||73|| Driven by the commander-in-chief, Krtaantavaktra,
the chariot, yoked with excellent horses, sped like a swift arrow released by
Bharata. ||74|| Perched on a dry tree, the crow, extremely agitated, was making
a harsh sound, repeatedly flapping its wings and head. ||75|| A woman, afflicted
by great sorrow, with her hair disheveled, and weeping, came forward and began
to cry. ||76|| Although Sita saw these inauspicious omens, she continued to move
forward with unwavering determination, her mind fixed on the Jina. ||77|| The
chariot, traversing the peaks of mountains, ravines, caves, and forests, covered
a yojana in the blink of an eye. ||78|| That chariot, yoked with horses as swift
as Garuda, adorned with white flags, and resembling the sun's chariot in
brilliance, moved forward without any hindrance. ||79|| The chariot, on which
Rama's beloved, the queen of the gods, was riding, whose speed was like that of
a wish, and whose horses were driven by Krtaantavaktra, the charioteer, was
exceedingly beautiful. ||80|| There, Sita, with a slender body supported by a
cushion, was seated on an excellent seat, and was moving forward, looking at
various kinds of land. ||81|| She saw, with great curiosity, beautiful ponds
adorned with lotuses and other flowers, sometimes in villages, sometimes in
cities, and sometimes in forests. ||82|| She saw, sometimes, a vast grove of
trees, where the dense darkness was like the night covered by a cloud-like
sheet, and whose separateness was difficult to discern. ||83|| Sometimes, she
saw a forest, whose flowers, fruits, and leaves had fallen, which was thin, with
few branches, and whose leaves were sparse, like a widowed woman of a noble
family. ||84||

206 In the Padma Purana A certain beautiful Madhavi, clinging to a companion, is
like a courtesan attached to a fickle Ashoka tree. (5) The great mass of trees,
destroyed by a forest fire, does not shine like the heart of a saint struck by
the words of a wicked person. (86) Somewhere, the forest-queen dances like the
wife of spring, moved by the gentle breezes that stir the dense mass of tender
leaves and creepers. (7) Somewhere, the flock of antelopes, startled by the loud
cries of the hunters, has fled far away. (8) Somewhere, looking upwards at the
peak of a mountain, with eyes filled with wonder at the various mineral
formations, (9) Somewhere, with rivers whose waters are clear and shallow, she
appears like a distressed woman whose eyes are filled with tears, her lover
having gone abroad. (10) Somewhere, she seems to be uttering melodious sounds,
imitating the cries of various birds, and somewhere, she appears to be making a
joyful, carefree sound. (11) Somewhere, she shines like a fruit-laden tree,
being praised by the bees intoxicated with nectar. (12) Somewhere, shaken by the
wind, the tree with its abundant foliage and large branches, showers flowers as
if engaged in ceremonial offerings. (13) Seeing this forest, teeming with wild
animals, Sita, whose mind is focused on Rama, proceeds. (14) Hearing a very deep
and sweet sound, she contemplated whether it was the sound of Rama's drum. (15)
Having seen the Ganga, she recognized that this was the echo of that sound heard
from another direction. (16) Somewhere, the river, disturbed by the movements of
crocodiles, alligators and sharks, has its lotuses trembling from the impact of
the surging waves. (17) Somewhere, the tall trees, uprooted from their bases,
with the force of the great boulders that have been split apart, (18)

Chapter Seventy-Seven 203 The river, created by the sons of Sagara, extends to
the edge of the ocean, is deep as the netherworld, and adorned with white
sandbanks. ||1|| It is terrifying with its huge whirlpools, filled with foam,
and is beautified by flocks of birds perched on its banks. ||10|| Horses, swift
as the wind, crossed that Ganga, just as the virtuous cross the world with the
essence of right knowledge. ||11||  Then, though always steadfast like Mount
Meru, the commander, Krtaantavaktra, was filled with sorrow, being
compassionate. ||102|| Unable to speak, overwhelmed by great grief, and unable
to control himself, Krtaantavaktra was overcome by a torrent of tears. ||103||
He stopped his chariot, cried out loudly, placed his hands on his head, and
stood there, his body limp and his radiance gone. ||104|| Then, Sita, her heart
broken, said, "Krtaantavaktra, why are you weeping like a man in great sorrow?
||105|| You are filling me with sorrow at this time of great joy. Why are you
weeping in this desolate forest?" ||106|| "Because of my duty to obey my
master's orders, and because I am obliged to speak the truth, I have somehow
stopped weeping and have reported the truth." ||107|| "Hearing the words of the
wicked, which are like poison, weapons, or fire, Sri Rama, terrified by the ill-
repute, abandoned his love for you, which was difficult to abandon, just as a
sage abandons worldly desires. ||108-109||  Oh, master! Though Lakshmana tried
every way to make him understand your situation, he did not relent. ||110|| Just
as a being without a connection to Dharma has no refuge for its happiness,  1.

11. In the Padma Purana, Neither Savitri, nor a brother, nor a group of
relatives. This forest, filled with deer, is your refuge now, O Devi. ||112||
Hearing your words, she was struck like by a thunderbolt. Filled with sorrow in
her heart, she was overcome by delusion. ||113|| With great difficulty,
regaining consciousness, with faltering words, she spoke, asking, "Grant me a
glimpse of my Lord, even once." ||114|| He replied, "O Devi, that city is now
far away. How can you see the Lord, who gives harsh commands?" ||115|| Then,
with streams of tears washing her lotus face, though overwhelmed by the nectar
of love, she spoke. ||116|| "O Commander, convey this message to Rama from me: O
Lord, do not be saddened by my abandonment." ||117|| "O Great Soul, relying on
supreme fortitude, always protect your subjects, just like a father, a lover of
justice." ||118|| For just as people always desire the moon of the autumn
season, so too do people desire a king who has attained the pinnacle of arts and
is the cause of joy. ||119|| Be worthy of worshipping that Right-Vision, by
which noble beings are liberated from the terrible cycle of birth and death,
filled with sorrow. ||120|| O Rama, that Right-Vision is considered more
valuable than even an empire, for an empire may perish, but Right-Vision bestows
lasting happiness. ||121|| O Best of Men, do not abandon that Right-Vision, even
if you are frightened by the disgust of the unworthy, for it is extremely rare.
||122|| A jewel that falls into the ocean, once held in the palm of the hand,
can be retrieved by what means? ||123|| A child, throwing the fruit of
immortality into a well, filled with great danger, suffers extreme sorrow,
filled with regret. ||124|| He who is like that, speaks as he pleases, without
restraint. For who can silence the mouth of this world? ||125|| You have no
refuge, knowing that your master is without affection. ||111|| O Devi! For you,
neither your mother is a refuge, nor your brother, nor your family. At this
time, this forest, filled with deer, is your only refuge. ||112|| After that,
Sita, hearing his words, was filled with sorrow in her heart, struck like by a
thunderbolt, and was overcome by delusion. ||113|| With great difficulty,
regaining consciousness, with faltering words, she spoke, asking, "Grant me a
glimpse of my Lord, even once." ||114|| In response, Krtaantavaktra said, "O
Devi! That city is now far away, so how can you see the Lord, who gives harsh
commands?" ||115|| Then, Sita, though washing her lotus face with streams of
tears, overwhelmed by the nectar of love, spoke. ||116|| "O Commander! Convey

||117|| "O Great Soul! Relying on supreme fortitude, always protect your

as he pleases, without restraint. For who can silence the mouth of this world?

## The Seventy-Seventh Chapter  Even though you will hear many things that
destroy the purpose of life, you should not hold them in your heart like a fool.
You should act with deliberation. (126)  Just as the sun, though extremely
radiant, illuminates all things in the world as they are and never becomes
tainted, is therefore dear to all, so too, though you are endowed with strict
governance, you should remain true to your nature, knowing all things in the
world as they are, and never become tainted, thus remaining dear to all like the
sun. (127)  Subdue the wicked by giving them something, keep your loved ones
happy by showing them affection, subdue your enemies by being virtuous, and keep
your friends happy by serving them with good intentions. (128)  Subdue anger
with forgiveness, pride with humility, deceit with honesty, and greed with
patience. (129-130)  O Lord, you are proficient in all scriptures, so it is not
appropriate for me to give you advice. This is just the fickleness of my heart,
which is connected to your love. (131)  O Master, if I have done anything
disrespectful due to being under your control or out of jest, please forgive me.
(132)  O Lord, it seems that this is all the time I have to see you. Therefore,
I say again and again that my actions, whether right or wrong, are all worthy of
forgiveness. (133)  Having said this, Sita, who had already descended from the
chariot, fell to the ground covered with grass and stones. (134)  Fallen on the
earth, Sita, motionless from fainting, appeared as if a collection of jewels had
been scattered. (135)  Seeing Sita in such a state, the commander was deeply
distressed and thought, "She will barely be able to sustain her life." (136)  In
this terrible forest, filled with a multitude of ferocious beasts, even a brave
man cannot hope to survive. (137)  Leaving this deer-eyed one in this terrible
forest, I do not see a place where I can find peace. (138)  On this side, there
is extreme cruelty, and on that side, there is the firm command of my master.
Alas! I, a sinner, have fallen into the midst of a great whirlpool of sorrow.
(139)  Who is capable of binding the mouth of this world? (125)

Jain Terms Preserved:  1. Bhrtya (servant) 2. Nrpendrasaktivasyah (under the
power of the king's might) 3. Nindyanama (of infamous name) 4. Piscacavat (like
a demon) 5. Citra-capa-samanasya (like a painted bow) 6. Nirmaryavahino
(carrying impure things) 7. Tulayantrasamanasya (like a balance scale) 8.
Pustakarmsamatmanah (whose nature is like a puppet) 9. Vimanamuktasya (like one
freed from an aerial vehicle) 10. Niḥsattvasyamahamamsa-vikrayam kurvatah (who
always sells his own flesh, being devoid of spirit)  Translation:  Shame on the
servitude! That which creates a blameworthy world-enjoyer, makes the self
dependent, and is served by mean human beings. \\140\\ Whose life is like the
mechanical movements of a machine and whose soul is immersed in sorrow, the life
of such a servant is better than that of a dog. \\141\\ He who is under the
power of the king's might and of infamous name, what does he not do like a
demon, and what does he not utter? \\142\\ Whose life is blameworthy, who is
endowed with the quality of being devoid of any action, and whose body is always
humble. \\143\\ Shame on the sustenance of the name of the servant, who is like
a cesspool, and from whom, after using, people turn their minds away, just as
they do from a cesspool carrying impure things. \\144\\ Shame on the sustenance
of the servant, who, after losing his dignity, even has to bend down for water,
who is like a balance scale. \\145\\ May the life of the servant, whose nature
is like a puppet, devoid of elevation, shame, brilliance and his own will, not
be attained by anyone. \\146\\ Shame on the sustenance of the servant, who,
though freed from an aerial vehicle, is always going down due to his gravity.
\\147\\ Shame on the sustenance of the servant, who is always devoid of spirit,
constantly sells his own flesh, is free from pride, and is dependent. \\148\\ I
am compelled by the action due to which servitude has to be performed.
Therefore, even in this dreadful situation, I do not renounce this (servitude).
\\149\\ Reflecting in this way and abandoning Sita, the embodiment of
righteousness, the general, filled with shame, proceeded towards Ayodhya.
\\150\\ The other (Sita), having regained consciousness, extremely distressed,
like a deer separated from the herd, took refuge in weeping. \\151\\

## Chapter Seventy-Seven  **213**  Like a wounded deer, she wept. The trees, as
if shedding their flowers, also seemed to weep in sympathy. **(152)**
Overwhelmed by immense sorrow, she lamented in a voice as sweet as nature's
melody. **(153)**  "Oh, Lotus-eyed one! Oh, Padma! Oh, best of men! Oh, Lord!
Oh, God! Please answer me, console me!" **(154)**  "You are always engaged in
virtuous deeds, adorned with good qualities, compassionate, and endowed with the
qualities of a great man. There is no fault in you for my abandonment."
**(155)**  "This is the fruit of my own past actions. I must inevitably endure
this intense suffering." **(156)**  "What can my beloved husband, my son, my
father, or even Narayana do when my own karma is bearing fruit?" **(157)**
"Surely, I must have accumulated sins in a previous birth, for I am now
suffering this extreme pain in this desolate forest, as an unfortunate woman."
**(158)**  "I must have spoken falsely about someone in a gathering, for this
calamity has befallen me." **(159)**  "I must have broken a vow in a previous
birth, in the presence of my Guru, for this is the consequence." **(160)**  "Or
perhaps, in another life, I scorned someone with harsh words, like poison-laced
fruit, and this is the result of that action." **(161)**  "I believe that in a
previous birth, I separated a pair of Chakwā-Chakwi birds who resided in a lotus
grove. That is why I am now without my husband." **(162)**  "Or perhaps, I
separated a pair of swans who lived in a lake adorned with lotuses, who delayed
the journey of noble men, who were known for their sweet calls and beauty, who
were as radiant as Lakshmana's palace, and whose faces and feet were as red as
lotuses. I must have separated them in a previous birth due to my own
misconduct, and that is why I am now suffering this terrible exile, separated
from my home." **(163-165)**  "Or perhaps, I separated a pair of lovers whose
eyes were like halves of a Guñjā fruit, who had entrusted their hearts to each
other, who were as dark as the black pepper plant, and whose wealth and
prosperity were as vast as the Himalayas." **(166)**

In the Padma Purana, I must have separated the pair of doves, who were playing
happily, with a sweet, barely audible sound in their throats, with a sinful
mind. || 167 || Or I must have kept them in an inappropriate place, or tied them
up, or killed them, or deprived them of honor, care, and nourishment. That is
why I have been subjected to such suffering. || 168 || Or perhaps, during the
beautiful spring season, when all the trees were adorned with flowers, I must
have separated the pair of cuckoos, which resulted in this outcome. || 166 || Or
perhaps, I must have condemned the ascetics, who were virtuous, upholders of
good conduct, masters of their senses, and worthy of praise from the learned. As
a result, I have been subjected to this great suffering. || 170 || I, who used
to reside in a heavenly abode, constantly served by a group of excellent
servants who were delighted to receive orders, how can I now dwell in this dense
forest, devoid of kin? My store of merit has dwindled, I am submerged in the
ocean of sorrow, and I am a great sinner. || 171 || I used to sleep comfortably
on a magnificent bed, adorned with various gems, covered with a fine sheet, and
equipped with all amenities. I used to enjoy the sweet sounds of the flute, the
trisarika, and the veena in the morning. || 172 - 174 || I, who was the chief
queen of Shri Ramdev, am now consumed by the fire of disgrace and am filled with
sorrow. How can I, a sinner, dwell alone in this desolate forest, amidst a
multitude of insects, harsh thorns, and sharp stones on the earth? || 175-176 ||
If these very breaths remain within me, even after experiencing such a state,
then it must be said that my breaths are made of diamond. || 177 || Oh, heart!
The fact that you do not shatter into a hundred pieces, even after experiencing
such a state, shows that there is no other brave soul like you. || 178 || What
should I do? Where should I go? Whom should I tell? Whose refuge should I seek?
How can I stay? Alas, Mother! Why did this happen? || 176 || Oh, Ram, the ocean
of virtues! Oh, Lakshman, the devotee! Oh, Father! Do you not recognize me? Oh,
Mother! Why do you not protect me? || 180 || Oh, brother, the lord of the
Vidyadharas, adorned with earrings! This is the delusion caused by the cycle of
suffering, and I am trapped in it. || 181 || 1. Kokilyugam. 2. Nirbandhugrahane.
3. Me mam.

## The 11th Chapter  215  Alas, I, a sinner, have been blessed with great
wealth, but I have not been able to worship the Jinas in their temples on earth.
||182||  Seeing Sita in such a state of distress, the king, Vajrajangha, arrived
at the forest. ||183||  Vajrajangha, the lord of the city of  Pundarika, had
come to the forest to capture elephants. He was returning with great pomp,
having captured a magnificent elephant. ||184||  The soldiers in the vanguard of
his army, though armed with various weapons, handsome, valiant, and with swords
strapped to their sides, were struck with doubt and fear upon hearing Sita's
extremely beautiful lament. They could not take a single step forward.
||185-186||  The group of horses in the front of the army also stopped, and even
the horsemen, filled with apprehension, could not motivate them to move forward,
having heard the sound of her lament. ||187||  They began to ponder: "In this
extremely terrifying forest, where there are many creatures who are the cause of
death, this beautiful sound of a woman's weeping is heard. What is this strange
thing?" ||188||  "Where the deer, buffalo, wolf, cheetah, and lion roam, where
the eight-legged creatures and the tigers wander, and where it is terrifying
because of the tusks of the boars, in the midst of this forest, who is this one
weeping, who is skilled in stealing hearts, like the line of the most pure
moon?" ||189||  "Is this the Indraani, who was abandoned by Indra and has come
down to earth from the Saudharma heaven? Or is this some goddess who has come
from somewhere, who destroys the music of human happiness and brings about the
cause of destruction?" ||190||  Thus, the army, which was filled with doubt, had
abandoned its efforts, and the original men, who were moving swiftly, had
gathered there. The army, which was like a great whirlpool, with a great deal of
music playing, and which was filled with wonder, stood still. ||191||  1.  Mahya

## The Eighth and Ninetieth Chapter  Then, seeing the river Jahnavi, as if
obstructed by great knowledge, and the army transformed into a circle, with
Vajrajangha mounted on an elephant, he asked the nearby men, "Why are you
standing like this? Who has obstructed your journey? Why are you all
distressed?"  As the men inquired about the reason for the army's halt,
following tradition, the king heard a sound of weeping. He, who had toiled in
all the signs, said, "The sound of weeping, so beautiful, belongs to a woman who
is pregnant, radiant like the heart of lightning, virtuous, and unparalleled.
Surely, she must be the wife of a great man."  "Oh, God! How can there be doubt
in your words? You have witnessed many wondrous things before."  While this
conversation continued between the servants and the king Vajrajangha, some brave
men went forward and approached Sita. They asked, "Oh, Goddess! Who are you in
this desolate forest? Why are you lamenting this unbearable sorrow?"  "In this
world, we do not see auspicious forms like yours. Are you a goddess? Or some
other supreme creation?"  "If you possess such a pure and unburdened body, then
this sorrow of yours is completely incomprehensible. Tell us, oh, auspicious
one, if this is something worth telling, for we are very curious. Perhaps, by
knowing the reason, your sorrow may end."  Then, seeing those men, radiant with
the light of various weapons, Sita, whose entire world had been plunged into
darkness by great sorrow, trembled violently from fear. Her eyes became
restless, and she was ready to give them her ornaments.  Then, those men,
bewildered and frightened, said again, "Oh, Goddess! Abandon your fear and
sorrow, and take refuge in courage."

~, In the Padma Purana, Or adorned with jewels, may they stand on your right.
Why are you resorting to emotional yoga? ||15|| This noble man, known as
Vajrajanga on earth, has arrived. He is renowned, endowed with all royal
virtues, the best of men. ||16|| The jewel of right faith, devoid of similarity,
indestructible, unattainable, unstealable, bestowing supreme happiness. ||17||
Free from the dirt of doubt, firm like Mount Meru, he holds this supreme
ornament in his heart with a mindful mind. ||18|| O virtuous one, O praiseworthy
one, whose right faith shines so brightly, how can we, like ourselves, describe
his virtues? ||19|| He who knows the principles of the Jina's teachings, is
affectionate towards those who seek refuge, devoted to the welfare of others,
compassionate and tender-hearted. ||20|| He is of noble lineage, pure of soul,
with a mind free from blameworthy actions, a protector like a father, devoted to
the welfare of beings. ||21|| He is a special protector of the poor and
helpless, even of mothers. He is a doer of pure actions, a great destroyer of
enemies like a mountain. ||22|| He is weary from the practice of weapons and
scriptures, but tireless in the work of peace. He knows another man's wife as he
knows a well with a serpent. ||23|| He is deeply devoted to Dharma, always
fearing the fall from existence. He is truthful, with established righteous
speech, and his senses are well-controlled. ||24|| O goddess, whoever wishes to
speak of all his virtues, is like trying to cross the ocean with a single arm.
||25|| As long as this story, captivating the mind, continues among them, the
king, Vajrajanga, has arrived, somewhat touched by wonder. ||26|| Descending
from the elephant, with appropriate humility, Vajrajanga, with his naturally
pure vision, looked and spoke thus. ||27|| Oh, it seems that man is made of
stone and devoid of consciousness, for he did not tear you to pieces, leaving
you in this forest. ||28|| O auspicious one, tell me the reason for this state
of yours. Be at ease, do not fear, and do not cause distress to the womb. ||29||

## The Eighty-First Chapter  311  Then, though she had refrained from speaking
for a moment due to distress, Sita again wept, her mind tormented by the wheel
of sorrow. ||30||  Then, urged by the king, who spoke sweetly, she, suppressing
her anger, spoke in a voice choked with grief, like a distressed swan. ||31||
"O King, if you wish to know, then listen with your mind, for this story of
mine, an unfortunate woman, is very long. ||32||  I am Sita, the daughter of
King Janaka, the sister of Bhamandala, the daughter-in-law of Dasharatha, and
the wife of Rama. ||33||  King Dasharatha, by the boon of Kekaya, gave his
position to Bharata and embraced the path of an ascetic. ||34||  Therefore,
Rama, Lakshmana, and I had to go to the forest. You must have heard, O virtuous
one, about all that happened. ||35||  I was abducted by the king of the
Rakshasas, Ravana. My husband, Rama, united with Sugriva, and I received news on
the eleventh day. ||36||  My husband, after crossing the ocean in celestial
chariots, defeated Dashanana in battle and brought me back. ||37||  Bharata,
like a chakravarti, renounced his kingdom and embraced the path of a Digambara,
shedding the dust of karma and attaining liberation. ||38||  Kekaya, consumed by
grief for her son, took initiation and, after performing austerities, ascended
to heaven. ||39||  On this earth, people without restraint, with wicked minds,
without any doubt, slander me, saying that Ravana, a great scholar, took another
man's wife, and Rama, a knower of Dharma Shastra, brought her back and continues
to serve her. ||40-41||  The state in which a king with firm resolve conducts
himself is also beneficial for us, there is no fault in it. ||42||  When I, with
a thin body, became pregnant, I thought, "I will worship all the Jina images on
this earth." ||43||  Then, my husband, Rama, who is full of glory, was eager to
worship the Jina images in the places of great merit of the Jina. ||44||  He
said, "O Sita, first let us go to Mount Kailasa and worship Rishabha, the joy of
the world." ||45||

## Translation:  220 Padma Purana  Then, in this Ayodhya city, we will pay
homage to the images of Rishabha and other Tirthankaras, which are established
in their birthplace, with great splendor. ||46|| Then, we will go to Kampilya
city to pay our respects to Vimalnath with devotion, and then we will proceed to
Ratnapura city to pay homage to Dharmanath, who teaches the harmony of Dharma.
||47|| In Shravasti, we will pay our respects to Sambhavanath, in Champapuri to
Vasupujya, in Kakanda to Pushpadanta, in Kaushambi to Padma Prabha, in
Chandrapura to Chandra Prabha, in Bhadraka forest to Shitalnath, in Mithila to
Malli Jineshwara, in Varanasi to Suparshva, in Singhapuri to Shreyans, in
Hastinapur to Shanti Kunth and Aranath. And, O Devi! After that, we will go to
Kushagra Nagar-Rajagriha to pay our respects to the omniscient Muni Suvrata,
whose radiant Dharmachakra continues to shine brightly. ||48-51|| Then, O
Vaidehi! Due to the extraordinary qualities of the Jina, we will pay homage to
all the other extremely sacred places, renowned throughout the world, which are
praised and worshipped by the gods, demons, and Gandharvas. ||52-53|| Then, we
will ascend the Pushpaka Vimana, quickly cross the sky, and with me, worship the
Jina images on the peaks of Mount Meru. ||54|| O beloved! Worship the Jina with
flowers from the Bhadrashala forest, the Nandana forest, and the Saumanasa
forest. ||55|| Then, O beloved! We will pay homage to all the artificial and
natural images in this world and return to Ayodhya. ||56|| Even a single act of
homage offered with devotion to the Arhant liberates a being from the sins
committed in past lives. ||57|| O beloved! I am also filled with immense joy at
the thought of seeing these highly sacred Chaityalayas, as per your wish. ||58||
Earlier, when this time was enveloped in the darkness of ignorance and humans
were completely destitute due to the destruction of the Kalpa trees, this world
was adorned by the Jina Adinath, just as the moon adorns the sky. ||59|| He was
the unique master of the people, the eldest, worshipped by the three worlds, and
the teacher of the path to liberation for the fearful and fortunate beings.

## The Eighth Chapter  This chapter is adorned with eight types of divine powers
and various excellences. It is filled with endless wonders and is captivating to
gods and demons alike. (11)  He who revealed the pure nature of the soul and
other principles to the worthy beings, having fulfilled his duty, attained the
ultimate liberation. (12)  The Chakravarti Bharat built a divine temple made of
all precious jewels on Mount Kailash and installed the image of the Lord there.
(63)  The image, resembling the sun, is five hundred bows high and is divine. It
is the image of the unparalleled Lord, and it shines brightly. (64)  Even today,
Gandharvas, Devas, Kinnaras, Apsaras, Nagas, and Daityas perform the great
worship of the Lord with great care. (65)  The Lord Rishabhadeva is infinite,
supreme, perfect, auspicious, Shiva, omnipresent, pure, worthy of worship by the
three worlds, self-existent, and self-lord. (66)  When will I go to Mount
Kailash, the supreme mountain, and worship the Lord Rishabhadeva with you? (67)
Thus, with great determination, we set out together. But on the way, we
encountered the unbearable news of the slander of the people, like a raging
fire. (68)  Then, my master, who always acts with deliberation, thought, "This
world, by nature, is deceitful and cannot be controlled otherwise." (69)  It is
better to face death even by abandoning loved ones, but this slander, which will
last until the end of the kalpa, is not good for our reputation. (70)  Although
I am innocent, I was abandoned in this dense forest by my wise master, who was
afraid of the slander of the people. (71)  This is the nature of a Kshatriya,
who is born of a pure lineage, has a noble heart, and is knowledgeable in all
scriptures. (72)  Thus, she, the sorrowful Sita, narrated her story related to
her exile and began to weep again, consumed by the fire of grief. (73)  Seeing
her, whose face was filled with tears and whose body was covered with dust, the
king Vanajangha, who possessed the best qualities of character, was also filled
with sorrow. (74)  Then, knowing her to be the daughter of King Janaka, King
Vanajangha approached her and comforted her with kind words. (75)

222 In the Padma Purana, you are grieving and lamenting separation, but you are
aware of the glory of the Jina teachings. Why are you engaging in this sorrowful
meditation, which only increases your suffering? ||76||  O Vaidehi, do you not
know that the state of the world is like this: impermanent, without refuge,
characterized by oneness and otherness? ||77|| You are grieving repeatedly like
a woman with a false perception. You have constantly heard the true meaning from
the virtuous. ||78||  Surely, the foolish-hearted being, attached to the cycle
of births and deaths, and unaware of the path to liberation, has experienced
countless sorrows in this life. ||79||  The being, dwelling in the ocean of
existence and immersed in the whirlpool of afflictions, has experienced
countless unions and separations. ||80||  As a celestial being, an aquatic
being, or a terrestrial being, the being has endured unbearable suffering in the
lower realms, born from rain, cold, and heat. ||81||  Even in the human realm,
what great suffering has the being not experienced, arising from insults,
slander, separation, and abuse? ||82||  In the realm of the gods, the being has
experienced great suffering arising from bad conduct, the sight of great wealth,
and the fall from that state. ||83||  And, O auspicious one, how can the
suffering experienced in the hells be described? It arises from cold, heat,
caustic substances, weapons, vicious creatures, and mutual killing and beating.
||84||  O Maithili, in this life, the being has experienced countless
separations, anxieties, illnesses, painful deaths, and sorrows. ||85||  There is
no place in this world, whether above, in the middle, or below, where the being
has not experienced the suffering of birth, death, and old age. ||86||  Driven
by the wind of its own karma, the being constantly wanders in the ocean of
existence. Even in the human realm, the being has obtained a female body like
this. ||87||  You are endowed with the remaining good and bad karmas. Your
husband, Rama, is beautiful with virtues and born of auspicious fortune. ||88||
You attained happiness with him, born of auspicious fortune. Now, due to the
rise of inauspicious fortune, you have experienced unbearable suffering. ||89||
You reached Lanka, carried by Ravana. There, you stopped wearing garlands and
applying unguents, and on the eleventh day... ||90||

## The Eighty-Ninth Chapter  Having slain the adversary, she was brought back
from there.  She has attained happiness again by the grace of Baldeva. ||1||
She was again impregnated by the evil omen, and was freed from the serpent of
slander without any fault. ||12||  He who burns the house of virtuous flowers
with abusive words, may that extremely terrible sin be consumed by fire. ||13||
O great Goddess, you are blessed, and your efforts are highly commendable, as
you have taken refuge in the abode of the Caitya. ||3||  Even today, you have
merit, O virtuous one, as I have seen you in the forest of Maya, brought by the
elephant. ||15||  I am the son of the king, born of the lineage of Indra, who is
devoted to good deeds, the elephant-charioteer, and the wife of his close
relative. ||16||  I am Vajrajangha, the lord of the city of  Pundarika, and you
are my elder sister by the law of Dharma, O virtuous one. ||17||  O best one,
rise and leave this city of darkness. Even for the sake of the king's daughter,
nothing is accomplished. ||3||  If you stay there, she will be filled with
remorse, and there is no doubt that Rama will search for you again. ||6||  Who,
being a great scholar, would not search for a jewel that has been lost due to
carelessness, a jewel that is brilliant and possesses great qualities? ||10||
Being thus advised by him, who was a master of the essence of Dharma, the
daughter of Janaka attained fortitude, having found her brother. ||11||  She
praised him, saying, "You are my true brother, you are auspicious, glorious,
wise, courageous, and compassionate to the virtuous." ||102||  She has attained
the right vision, grasped the true meaning, and her soul is purified by the
three jewels. She is like a virtuous person, with a pure mind, and is dedicated
to the virtues of vows, qualities, and conduct. ||103||  The conduct of a
virtuous person, free from faults and dedicated to the welfare of others, does
not destroy the sorrow of anyone who is deeply devoted to the teachings of the
Jinas. ||10||  By the grace of Sri Rama, she again attained happiness, and
became pregnant. She was then freed from the evil omen by the serpent of
slander, without any fault. ||60-62||  He who burns the house of virtuous
flowers with abusive words, may that extremely terrible sin be consumed by fire.
May your sinful deeds be quickly destroyed. ||3||  O Goddess, you are truly
blessed, and your efforts are highly commendable, as you have taken refuge in
the abode of the Caitya. ||64||  O virtuous one, even today you have merit, as I
have seen you in the forest of Maya, brought by the elephant. ||65||  I am
Vajrajangha, the son of the king, born of the lineage of Indra, who is devoted
to good deeds, the elephant-charioteer, and the wife of his close relative. I am
the lord of the city of Pundarika. O virtuous one, you are my elder sister by
the law of Dharma. ||66-67||  O best one, rise and leave this city of darkness.
Even for the sake of the king's daughter, nothing is accomplished. ||8||  O
faithful wife, if you stay there, she will be filled with remorse, and there is
no doubt that Rama will search for you again. ||66||  Who, being a great
scholar, would not search for a jewel that has been lost due to carelessness, a
jewel that is brilliant and possesses great qualities?  All would want to find
it. ||10||  Being thus advised by him, who was a master of the essence of
Dharma, the daughter of Janaka attained fortitude, having found her brother.
||101||  She praised him, saying, "You are my true brother, you are auspicious,
glorious, wise, courageous, and compassionate to the virtuous. You have attained
the right vision, grasped the true meaning, and your soul is purified by the
three jewels. You are like a virtuous person, with a pure mind, and are
dedicated to the virtues of vows, qualities, and conduct." ||102-103||  The
conduct of a virtuous person, free from faults and dedicated to the welfare of
others, does not destroy the sorrow of anyone who is deeply devoted to the
teachings of the Jinas.  It destroys the sorrow of all. ||10||  She received
food. Then, after the enemy Ravana was slain, she was brought back from there,
and by the grace of Baldeva...

brother, filled with true love. That is why, with your pure soul like the sun,

## The Ninety-Ninth Chapter  And then, in a moment, the king summoned a
palanquin, supported by excellent pillars, adorned with various garlands,
resembling a celestial chariot, beautiful, built with proper proportions,
adorned with excellent mirrors, lanterns, and moon-like white yak-tail whisks,
embellished with pearl-like beads, adorned with colorful garments, with large
garlands spread out, decorated with paintings, and equipped with excellent
windows.  Upon this palanquin, Sita embarked. At that time, Sita was endowed
with supreme wealth, moving amidst great warriors, contemplating the intricacies
of karma, and filled with wonder.  [1-4]  Sita, bearing the mark of excellent
conduct, crossed that formidable forest in three days and entered the land of
Pundarika. [5]  The land was covered with all kinds of grain, adorned with
villages and towns close together, [6] and so beautiful with cities radiating
like heavenly abodes that it was impossible to be satiated by looking at it, and
adorned with gardens and parks.  Seeing this land of Pundarika, she continued on
her journey. [7]  O Venerable One! O Goddess! O Praiseworthy One! By your sight,
we, the beings of the world, have become free from sin and fulfilled. [8]  Thus,
the elders of the village, bearing the mark of the king's radiance, offered
gifts and repeatedly paid homage to her. [9]  Kings, like gods, honored her with
offerings and salutations, praising her at every step. [10]  In due course, she
reached the vicinity of Pundarika-pura, a city extremely delightful and served
by its inhabitants. [11]  Hearing of Sita's arrival, the officials, by the
king's command, quickly decorated the city with great splendor. [12]  The wide
roads, with three-way and four-way intersections, were adorned on all sides,
sprinkled with fragrant water, and covered with flowers. [13]  Arches, like
rainbows, were erected, and pots, completely filled with leaves, were placed at
the gates. [14]

226 Padma Purana The city, adorned with fluttering flags and garlands, resounded
with auspicious sounds. It seemed to be dancing with joy, as if eager to perform
a dance. ||15|| The city walls, crowded with people, were like a grand assembly
hall. The city seemed to have grown immensely with joy, filled with a cacophony
of sounds. ||16|| The entire city, both inside and outside, was filled with a
throng of people eager to see Sita. It seemed as if the city itself had become
mobile, with people moving everywhere. ||17|| Then, the city was filled with the
sounds of various musical instruments, accompanied by the booming of conch
shells and the joyous cries of the people. ||18|| With their minds filled with
wonder, the citizens of the city watched as Sita entered the city, like Lakshmi
entering heaven. ||19|| Sita entered a magnificent palace, surrounded by gardens
and adorned with pools. It was as tall as Mount Meru and as white as the
complexion of Balarama. ||20|| The palace, located within the Vrajjangha house,
was extremely beautiful. Sita, the daughter of Janaka, entered the palace, where
she was worshipped by the king's wives. ||21|| The wise Vrajjangha, filled with
immense joy, worshipped Sita, his sister, as if she were the sun. ||22|| People
chanted, "Victory to Sita! May she live long! May she be happy! May she prosper!
May she command!" They also called her, "O Ishana! O Devi! O Revered One! O
Mistress!" ||23|| With their heads bowed, hands folded, and hearts filled with
reverence, the beautiful people, who were always by Sita's side, eagerly awaited
her commands. Their wishes were always fulfilled. ||24|| Sita, the daughter of
Janaka, resided there, her mind filled with thoughts of Dharma and Rama. She
constantly engaged in discussions about Dharma and Rama. ||25|| The king,
Vrajjangha, gave Sita all the gifts he received from his vassals and from the
morning offerings. Sita used these gifts to perform acts of Dharma. ||26|| The
commander-in-chief, whose face was like that of Yama, was filled with sorrow and
distress. He was exhausted from his arduous duties. ||27||

The ninety-ninth chapter 227 The messenger of Yama, whose army was exhausted and
who was surrounded by kings eager to hasten, went to Ramadeva with his head
bowed. ||27-28|| And said, "O Lord! O King! At your command, I left Sita in the
terrible forest, she who was only a companion to me in her pregnancy." ||26|| "O
Lord! At your command, I left Sita in that forest which is served by groups of
various kinds of extremely terrifying wild animals that make terrible sounds,
where there is dense darkness caused by groups of trees that take the form of
Vetalas, where there are many tigers and wild buffaloes who are constantly
engaged in battle out of natural hatred, where the sound of drums constantly
resounds from the wind striking the hollows, where the roar of lions echoes
within the caves, where the sound of sleeping pythons is as terrifying as the
sound of a crow walking on wood, where thirsty wolves have destroyed the hanging
fetuses of deer, where lions who fear blood lick the clusters of the Dhataki
tree, and which is skilled in producing a group of fears even for Yama."
||30-34|| "O Lord! I tell you the message of Sita, whose face is raining tears
like a day of misfortune and who is burning with great sorrow." ||35|| "Sita
Devi has told you that if you want her well-being, then you should not abandon
your devotion to the Jina, just as you have abandoned me." ||36|| "A king who is
attached to affection and love and who can abandon me, can certainly abandon
devotion to the Jina." ||37|| "A wicked man who is strong in words speaks
slander without thinking about it, but a wise man should consider it." ||38||
"Ordinary people do not speak of my faults in the same way that people who are
devoid of right knowledge speak of the faults of the jewel of true Dharma."
||39|| "What fault is there in my being abandoned in a terrible, desolate
forest? O Rama, you should not abandon the purity of right vision." ||40|| . ..

228 Padma Purana This one birth is painful for you, separated from me. But
losing right faith will cause you pain birth after birth. ||41|| For a human,
treasures, women, and vehicles are easy to obtain in this world. But the jewel
of right faith is more difficult to obtain than even an empire. ||42|| If you
commit sins in the kingdom, your fall into hell is certain. But if right faith
is with you, you will ascend to heaven by its power alone. ||43|| He whose soul
is adorned with the jewel of right faith, attains fulfillment in both worlds.
||44|| Hearing this message from Sita, whose heart is filled with love, whose
mind is firm, whose spirit is unwavering, what noble man would not be inspired?
||45|| Those who are naturally timid, become even more fearful when faced with
other fears. But even men are terrified by fierce and terrible horrors. The
meaning is that the terrible horrors that Sita, who is naturally timid, faces,
are not faced by men. ||46|| Oh God! Where there are groups of extremely bright,
wicked, and violent creatures that terrify even Yama, where elephants trapped in
the mud of a half-dry pond are roaring, where groups of cows are suffering,
their tails entangled in thorny bushes, where groups of deer are running
frantically, believing in the mirage of water, where monkeys are extremely
restless, their bodies covered in dust from the dust of the wind, where bears
are roaring, their faces covered with long, tangled hair, where groups of
wolves, thirsty and suffering, are sticking out their tongues like leaves, where
snakes are enraged by the cracking of gumchi pods and the falling of their
seeds, where creatures seeking shelter in trees are crying out in fear that the
trees might break and fall on them due to the strong wind, where dust and leaves
are flying up in the air, created by a sudden gust of wind, where many trees are
broken by the movement of large pythons, where terrible creatures are destroyed
by the enraged, intoxicated elephants, where the ground is hard, in the middle
of ponds dug by groups of boars, where the ground is covered with thorns,
pebbles, thorny bushes, and mounds of earth, where the juice of flowers is
flowing,  1. क्रन्दवृक्षके म० । 2. ध्वनि -म० । 3. गर्मुत् भ्रमरः श्री० टि० । 4.

Alas, Sita, your eyes are like three-colored lotuses, you are an ocean of pure
virtues, you have conquered the moon with your face, you are as delicate as the
inner part of a lotus.   Oh, Vaidehi! Oh, Vaidehi! Speak quickly. You know that
my heart is extremely distressed without you.   You are the possessor of
unparalleled character, beautiful, your conversation is beneficial and pleasing.
Your mind is free from sin.   You were free from any offense, yet I, being
merciless, left you. Oh, you who dwell in my heart! What state have you reached?
Oh, Devi! How will you stay in this forest, full of fearsome and wicked wild
animals, deprived of pleasures?   Your eyes are like intoxicated chakoras, you
are a reservoir of beauty, endowed with modesty and humility. Alas, my Devi!
Where have you gone?   Alas, Devi! The bees, attracted by the fragrance of your
breath, will gather near your face and hum. You will surely be distressed,
driving them away with your lotus hands.   Like a deer separated from its herd,
you will go where in this terrifying forest, which is unbearable even to think
about?   Your feet are soft like the inner part of a lotus, and your features
are beautiful. How will your delicate feet bear the rough ground?

In the Padma Purana, How will your feet endure the harshness of the earth?
||68|| Or, perhaps, those Mlechchas, whose minds are devoid of the knowledge of
right and wrong, have captured you and taken you to a terrible place. ||66|| My
dear, my virtuous one, I have left you in the forest, so this time you have
experienced a sorrow greater than any you have known before. ||70|| Or, perhaps,
you are sleeping in the dense darkness of night, filled with sorrow and covered
in the dust of the forest, and an elephant has crushed you. ||71|| How can you
endure the pain in this dense forest, filled with vultures, bears, jackals,
rabbits, and owls, where there is no visible path? ||72|| Or, my dear, have you
been taken to a place where you cannot speak, by a tiger whose mouth is
terrifying with fangs, whose body trembles with yawning, and who is consumed by
intense hunger? ||73|| Or, perhaps, you have been taken to a place beyond words
by a lion whose tongue is flickering and whose mane is beautiful, for who is not
powerful in matters of women? ||74|| Or, Goddess, have you been taken to a place
of disgrace by a fire, filled with flames and lacking tall trees? ||75|| Or,
perhaps, you were unable to seek shade, and so you have been consumed by the
unbearable rays of the sun. ||76|| Or, perhaps, your heart has been broken by
the uncertainty of it all, because you were a woman of noble character and I was
a cruel one, yet you still placed your heart in me. And so, you have met your
death. ||77|| Who now, like Hanuman and Ratnajaati, will bring news of Sita's
well-being? ||78|| Alas, my dear, alas, you of great virtue, alas, you of a
gentle heart, alas, you of good fortune! Where are you? Where have you gone?
What are you doing? Do you know nothing? ||79|| Oh, you with the face of death,
did you truly leave your beloved in this terrible forest? No, no, how could you
do such a thing? ||80|| Tell me, tell me, did you not leave her? Speak, like the
moon showering nectar from its mouth. ||81|| Thus spoken to, the general, whose
face was heavy with shame, whose radiance had faded, and who was devoid of
acceptance, said... ||82|| 1.  के योषितीदृशी ब० । किं योषितीदृशः म० ।

## The Ninety-ninth Chapter  23,  While meditating on Sita, who was in great
distress, Rama fainted again and was brought back to consciousness with great
difficulty. ||3||  In the meantime, Lakshmana arrived and, touching Rama, who
was filled with sorrow, said, "O Lord, why are you so distressed? Be patient."
||8||  This is the fruit of past karma, which has come to all beings, not just
the royal lady. ||5||  Whatever sorrow or happiness one has to experience in
this world, one receives it by oneself, without any external cause. ||6||  Even
if a being is taken to the sky, or to a forest filled with wild animals, or to
the top of a mountain, it is protected by its own merit. ||7||  O Lord, upon
hearing the news of Sita's abandonment, even the most ordinary people in this
land of Bharata felt sorrow in their hearts. ||8||  The people, tormented by
sorrow and melting away on all sides, their hearts were breaking, as if they
were pouring out tears. ||8||  Saying this, Lakshmana, deeply distressed, began
to lament, his face as pale as a lotus petal struck by frost. ||10||  Alas,
Sita! Your body is burning with the fire of the words of wicked people. You are
the earth that gives birth to the grain of virtue, and you are filled with noble
thoughts. ||11||  O Princess! Where have you gone? Your lotus feet were so
delicate. You were the earth that supported the mountain of virtue. O Sita! You
were so gentle and kind. ||12||  O Mother! See, the lotus, adorned with virtue
and served by royal swans, is scorched on all sides by the snow of the words of
wicked men. ||13||  O Excellent One! You were as virtuous as Subhadra, skilled
in all conduct, and you were the embodiment of happiness for all beings. Where
have you gone? ||14||  What is the sky without the sun, and what is the night
without the moon? Similarly, what is Ayodhya without that jewel of a woman?
||15||  The commander-in-chief was distraught. ||2||  When the grim reaper stood
silent, Rama, filled with immense sorrow, meditating on Sita, fainted again and
was brought back to consciousness with great difficulty. ||3||

##  Chapter 212 of the Padma Purana  **Verse 16:** The city is devoid of the
sounds of flutes, veenas, and mridangas, filled only with the cries of sorrow.
**Verse 17:** In the streets, gardens, forests, rivers, crossroads, palaces, and
markets, continuous streams of tears flow, creating a mud like that of the rainy
season.  **Verse 18:** With voices choked with sobs, the people, with great
difficulty, praise Janaki, even though she is no longer present, showering her
with the flowers of their virtues.  **Verse 19:** The entire world, with their
minds fixed on her alone, worships her, for she, radiant with virtues, has
become the pinnacle of all virtuous women.  **Verse 101:** Even the birds, like
the shuka, who were nurtured by Sita herself, are overwhelmed with grief and
sorrow, their bodies trembling, their cries echoing in the air.  **Verse 102:**
For whom, whose heart was connected to her virtues, is there no great sorrow for
Janaki?  **Verse 103:** But, wise one, regret is not a remedy for what has been
done. Therefore, you should strive to maintain your composure.  **Verse 104:**
Thus, encouraged by Lakshmana's words, Rama, having somewhat relinquished his
grief, focused his mind on the task at hand.  **Verse 105:** He instructed the
people, including Bhadra, about the funeral rites for Janaki, and summoned
Bhadrakalasha, the treasurer, saying, "Bhadra, give the donation to her,
following the same method she had instructed you before."  **Verse 106:** "As
you command," said the treasurer, with a pure heart, and for nine months, he
continued to provide the desired donations to the needy.  **Verse 107:** Even
though eight thousand women constantly served him, Rama never for a moment
forgot Sita in his heart.  **Verse 108:** His speech was always filled with the
name of Sita, and his mind, captivated by her virtues, saw her everywhere.
**Verse 109:** In his dreams, he saw Janaki, her body covered in dust, dwelling
in a cave in the mountains, her eyes constantly shedding tears.  **Verse 110:**
Just as the night has no beauty without the moon, Ayodhya has no beauty without
Sita.

The Ninety-Ninth Chapter 233 With a heart filled with sorrow, Rama, his eyes
filled with tears, thought with a sigh, "Alas! It is a great hardship that Sita,
with her beautiful demeanor, even though she is in another world, does not leave
me. She, being a virtuous woman, with her past good deeds, is still intent on my
welfare." 111-112 Then, gradually, as Sita's sorrow subsided, Rama regained his
composure with the remaining women. 113 Rama and Lakshmana, who were endowed
with the divine weapons called Hal and Chakra, who were righteous, filled with
unwavering love, and oceans of noble qualities, and who ruled the earth from the
Himalayas to the southern seas, shone brightly like the gods of the heavens.
114-115 Gautama Swami says to King Shrenik, "O King! In that Ayodhya, where men
were like gods, those two best of men, Rama and Lakshmana, with their excellent
radiance, attained supreme enjoyments like the Indras." 116 "Their character,
which was the result of their good deeds and which brought joy to all beings,
and who were radiant like the sun, remained immersed in the ocean of happiness
for an unknown period of time." 117 Thus ends the Ninety-Ninth Chapter, called
"Rama's Sorrow," in the Padma Purana, composed by the Acharya, known as Rishi
Ravishena. 66 1. Su-Prabhau, M. 2. Su-Krit, M. 3. Ravi-bhau + Ajnata-kalam, iti-

## One Hundred Chapters  Thus, this story has been told. Now, listen, O King, to
another story related to the salt-goad.   1.  The slender body of Janaka's
daughter, Sita, took on a whiteness as if it had been embraced by the pure merit
of all beings.  2.  The beautiful, pointed tips of her breasts were adorned with
a dark hue, as if they were sealed jars of milk, ready for her son to drink. 3.
Her gaze, soft and white, held an extreme sweetness, as if a long, wide river of
milk had been placed on her face for nourishment. 4.  Her body was adorned with
a multitude of auspicious signs, as if it were meant to reveal the glory of
infinite and vast blessings. 5.  As Sita gently placed her feet on the pure,
gem-studded floor, her reflection fell below, as if the earth, in the form of a
lotus, were serving her. 6.  The image of the doll, which is desired during
childbirth, was placed near Sita's bed, and its reflection fell on her cheek,
making it appear like Lakshmi herself. 7.  At night, when Sita went to the roof
of the palace, the reflection of the moon fell on her uncovered breasts, as if a
white umbrella had been placed over her womb. 8.  Even when she slept in her
dwelling, women with agile arms, holding various fly whisks, continued to wave
them over her. 9.  In her dreams, large elephants, adorned with ornaments,
performed an auspicious ablution over her with water kept in lotus leaf cups.
10.  When she awoke, the sound of "Victory, Victory" echoed repeatedly, as if
the beautiful dolls placed in the upper part of the palace were chanting it. 11.
When she called out to her family, they responded with "Your command, O Queen,"
their voices soft and ethereal, as if they were disembodied.

One Hundred Chapters 235 The lady of noble mind did not tolerate even a slight
transgression of an order, even in playful activities, and she would furrow her
brows in confusion even in tasks done with great speed. ||13|| Although mirrors
with desired gems were present nearby, she developed a habit of looking at the
edge of a drawn sword. ||14|| She disliked the sound of the bow, which was not
pleasing to women, and had the string removed from the veena. ||15|| Her eyes
found great delight in caged lions, and her head bowed only with great
difficulty, as if it were fixed in place. ||16|| When the ninth month was
complete, and the moon was in the Shravana constellation, on the full moon day
of the Shravana month, the auspicious Sita, adorned with all auspicious signs
and with a face like the full moon, gave birth to two sons, bringing joy and
happiness. ||17-18|| At their birth, the people became like dancers, and the
sounds of conch shells, drums, and cymbals filled the air. ||19|| The king,
filled with joy, celebrated a grand festival, like that of the mad people of the
world, and it was filled with beautiful wealth. ||20|| One of the sons was
adorned with the name Anangalavana, and the other, with a meaningful purpose,
was adorned with the name Madanankusha. ||21|| Then, those two boys, the sprouts
of a valiant man, grew up, bringing joy to their mother's heart. ||22|| Mustard
seeds were placed on their heads for protection, and they shone like sparks of
blazing fire, symbolizing their prowess. ||23|| Their bodies, tinged with the
yellow of saffron, seemed to be enveloped in their natural brilliance, which was
becoming increasingly evident. ||24|| The rows of large, tiger-like claws, set
in gold, adorned their hearts like a cluster of budding shoots. ||25|| Their
first, unspoken words, captivating the minds of all, seemed like the truth of
their birth, signifying that their birth was a holy day. ||26|| Their charming
smiles, like flowers, attracted the hearts of people, like bees attracted to
honey. ||27|| The words began to be uttered spontaneously. ||12||

In the Padma Purana, Their innocent and charming smiles captivated hearts
everywhere. ||27|| Just like the playful laughter that arose from being fed milk
by their mother, their small teeth adorned their lotus-like face. ||28|| Holding
onto their mother's fingers, they took five or six steps, captivating everyone's
hearts. ||26|| Seeing her sons engaged in such beautiful play, mother Sita
forgot all her sorrows. ||30|| Growing up and naturally radiating a charming
aura, both of them reached the stage of their bodies suitable for acquiring
knowledge. ||31|| Then, due to their virtuous karma, a renowned pure-souled
Ksullaka named Siddhartha arrived at the palace of King Vanajan. ||32|| This
Ksullaka was so powerful in his mastery of the great knowledge that he would
worship the Jina statues on Mount Meru every day during all three sandhyas and
return to his place in an instant. ||33|| He had a peaceful face, was a brave
and wise soul, his head was adorned with loose curls, his mind was filled with
pure thoughts, he possessed only a single garment, he was a follower of the
great Anuvrata, he was adorned with various virtues, he was a knower of the
secrets of the Jina teachings, and he was a master of the ocean of arts. ||34||
Wearing a white, flowing garment, he seemed like a majestic elephant adorned
with a garland of lotus stems, moving slowly, carrying his staff like a beloved
companion, and uttering the pleasing word "Dharmavruddhi" like the taste of
nectar. ||36|| He wandered from house to house, collecting alms, and by chance,
he reached the noble house where Sita resided. ||38|| Sita, who possessed a
charming disposition like that of a goddess of the Jina teachings, was
overwhelmed with joy upon seeing the Ksullaka and descended from her nine-
storied palace. ||36|| Approaching him, she joined her hands in reverence and
worshipped him properly with offerings of flowers and incense. ||40|| Being a
master of the scriptures, she offered him special food and drink with respect,
for she considered those devoted to the Jina teachings as her own kin. ||41||
After his meal, he was free from any further duties and remained comfortably.

Chapter One Hundred 27  His mind, subdued by the practice of great courtesy and
humility, the Kṣullaka, with a contented heart, saw Lavaṇāṅkuśa. ||43||  The
Kṣullaka, knowing the eight auspicious signs, heard from the Śrāvikā, who had
taken the vows, about her sons. He did not ask her to speak about them, as if
they were ordinary children. ||44||  Having heard the story, the Śrāvikā, with
tears streaming from her eyes, was overcome with grief for a moment. The
Kṣullaka was also saddened. ||45||  He said, "O Devi! You should not grieve, for
these two boys are like the sons of the gods." ||46||  Then, with his heart
filled with great love, the Kṣullaka, in a short time, taught Lavaṇāṅkuśa the
art of weaponry and scriptures. ||47||  In a short time, those sons became
endowed with knowledge and wisdom, experts in arts and virtues, and very skilled
in the art of summoning and dismissing divine weapons. ||48||  By the power of
their great merit, they, whose coverings had been destroyed, were holding the
supreme Lakshmi, like treasure pots. ||49||  For a teacher, there is no sorrow
in a disciple who is endowed with power, because all things are easily shown to
a man with eyes by the sun. ||50||  It is right that those who have a previous
acquaintance should obtain virtues easily, for what sorrow is there for swans
who descend into the lake of the mind? That is, there is none. ||51||  A teacher
who gives instruction to a worthy recipient attains his purpose. For just as the
light of the sun is useless to an owl, so too is the instruction of a teacher
useless to an unworthy recipient. ||52||  Then, with their increasing fame and
glory, which had enveloped the world, those two sons became beautiful and
difficult to look at, like the moon and the sun. That is, they were as beautiful
as the moon, and it was difficult to look at them, as if they were the sun.
||53||  With their manifest brilliance and strength, they, united together,
seemed like fire and wind, or, with their shoulders as firm as stone, they
appeared like the Himalayas and the Vindhyas. ||54||  Or, they were worthy of
wearing a beautiful garland, like the union of the two ages. They were pleasing
and beneficial, like the abode of Dharma. ||55||  The Kṣullaka, relieved, sat
down comfortably. Then, when asked, he told the story of his travels and other
matters to Sītā. ||42||

The two were like the Puranas, they were considered as the east and west
directions by the people. They were capable of the rise and fall of all the
luminous ones. ||56|| The vast earth, surrounded by the nearby ocean, appeared
to them like a small hut. And in this earth-shaped hut, if their shadow also
turned away from the light, they would also condemn it. ||57|| They were ashamed
even by the reflection in the toenail and they were greatly distressed even by
the breaking of the hair. ||58|| They were ashamed even by the umbrella
reflected in the jewel on the crown and they were irritated even by the
reflection of a man in the mirror. ||59|| They were angered even by the bow held
by the clouds and they were grieved even by the kings who did not bow down to
them. ||60|| They looked at the sun, which was content with its own vast
brilliance, with disdain, if there was any obstruction in its light. ||61|| They
would break even the strong wind, whose form was not visible, and their anger
would flare up even on the Himalayas, which were adorned with the hair of the
yak. ||62|| Their minds were saddened even by the conch shells that were falling
in the oceans and they could not tolerate even Varuna, the lord of the oceans.
||63|| They would make even the kings with umbrellas shadowless, that is, devoid
of radiance, and they would speak sweet words to them, being pleased by the
service of good men. ||64|| They were causing distress to the lineage of wicked
kings who were far away, that is, they were harming even the wicked kings who
were far away, let alone the ones who were nearby. ||65|| Their palms had turned
black due to constantly holding weapons, which made it seem as if they had
turned black from extinguishing the fire of the prowess of the rest of the
kings. ||66|| The deep sound of the bow, which was produced during practice,
made it seem as if they were conversing with all the women who were in the form
of directions. ||67|| "Just as there is salt, so there is a goad," thus, the two
were auspicious, with their words blooming and appearing. ||68||  (They were
skilled in establishing the best order in the age) They were like the great
bulls, or they were like the ashramas, beautiful and holding happiness. ||55||

## Chapter One Hundred  Two youths, adorned with the splendor of youth and
possessing the most beautiful demeanor, have attained fame on earth, like salt
and a goad. ||66|| They are worthy of being celebrated by all, and they arouse
the curiosity of everyone. Their very being is shaped by virtue, and their sight
brings happiness to all. ||70|| For the blossoming of young women, they are like
the full moon of autumn, and for the joy of Sita's heart, they are like the
moving Mount Meru. ||71|| They are like the sun among other princes, their eyes
are like white lotuses. They are like the gods called Dvipa Kumaras, and their
chests are adorned with the Srivatsa mark. ||72|| They are the foundation of
infinite valor, standing on the shore of the ocean of existence, bound together
by the strong bond of mutual love. ||73|| Though they are on the path of
righteousness, they are captivating and charming. Even with their qualities
being countless, they are free from any crookedness or deceit. ||74|| They have
conquered the sun with their brilliance, the moon with their radiance, Indra
with their power, the ocean with their depth, Mount Meru with their
steadfastness, the earth with their virtue of forgiveness, Jayakumar with their
valor, and Hanuman with their speed. ||75-76|| They can catch even a released
arrow with their speed, and they play in the vast waters with crocodiles and
other aquatic creatures. ||77|| Even after fighting with enraged elephants, they
do not experience fatigue, and their radiance is so powerful that even the rays
of the sun seem to scatter in fear. ||78|| They are like the virtuous in terms
of righteousness, like the sun in terms of fortitude, like the mountain in terms
of right vision, and like Sri Vijay Balabhadra in terms of charity. ||79|| They
are like Ayodhya in terms of pride, like Madhukaitabha in terms of courage, and
like Indrajit and Meghavahana in terms of their prowess in great battles. ||80||
They are devoted to serving their teachers, they are absorbed in the stories of
the Jina, and even the mere sound of their names instills fear in their enemies.

## The Kaadhik Shatam Parva  Then, seeing the two handsome princes fit for
marriage, Vajrajangha resolved to find a bride for them. ||1|| He decided to
give his daughter, Shashichula, born to Lakshmi Devi, along with thirty-two
other girls, to Lavana. ||2|| The king wanted to witness the auspicious wedding
ceremonies of both his sons simultaneously. Therefore, he searched everywhere
for a suitable bride for his second son. ||3|| Not finding a suitable bride, he
felt dejected, as if he had been deprived of something precious. Suddenly, he
remembered something and felt as if he had achieved his goal. ||4|| He
remembered that the king of Prithvi Nagar had a pure and noble daughter named
Kanakmala, born to his queen Amritavati. ||5|| She was like the line of the
moon, captivating everyone, victorious over Lakshmi, and a lotus without a
lotus, a paradox. ||6|| She was similar to Shashichula and auspicious. ||7||
Thinking thus, the king sent a messenger to Prithvi Nagar for this purpose.
||8|| The wise messenger reached Prithvi Nagar and, after being honored, spoke
to King Prithu. ||9|| As soon as King Prithu saw the messenger with pure vision,
before the messenger could utter a word about the request for his daughter, he
said, "O messenger! You are not at fault, for you are subservient and a mere
translator of others' words." ||10|| "Those who are devoid of inner warmth and
self-respect, whose souls are fickle, and who are filled with many insults, are
like the flow of water, carried wherever they are desired. You are one of them."

In the Padma Purana, it is said that lineage, character, wealth, beauty,
equality, strength, age, country, and knowledge are the qualities of a good
husband. However, among all these qualities, lineage is considered the most
important. The other qualities are desirable but not essential.   Therefore, how
can a daughter, who is considered honorable, be given to a man who lacks this
primary quality of lineage?   To the one who spoke so shamelessly and against
reason, it is not appropriate to give a daughter, but I will give you a
"daughter" (meaning a bad death).   The messenger, who was completely ignored,
returned to Vajrajangha and reported the situation.   Then, Vajrajangha himself
went halfway to Prithu's kingdom and, through a messenger, requested Prithu's
daughter again.   Despite showing respect to Prithu, Vajrajangha was unable to
obtain his daughter. Enraged, he decided to destroy Prithu's kingdom.   The king
of Prithu's kingdom, named Vyagraratha, was the protector of the kingdom's
borders. He was defeated by Vajrajangha in battle and imprisoned.   Knowing that
Vyagraratha, a powerful king, was imprisoned and that Vajrajangha was about to
destroy his kingdom, Prithu sought help from his friend, the king of Podana, who
had a large army.   Vajrajangha, in turn, sent a messenger with a letter to his
sons in Paundarika-pura, urging them to come quickly.   Upon hearing their
father's command, the princes immediately prepared for war, sounding the drums
and conch shells.   A great commotion, like a roaring ocean, arose in
Paundarika-pura.   Hearing this unprecedented sound of war preparations, Lavana
and Angkusha asked the people around them, "What is this?"   Upon learning that
this was all happening because of them, the two sons of Sita, eager for battle,
prepared to leave.

##  The Hundred and More Chapters  The two, who were filled with eagerness and
could not bear even a moment of defeat, whose great brilliance was manifest, did
not even tolerate the delay of their vehicle. ||26|| The sons of the forest-
dweller, the entire inner palace, and all the retinue, tried to stop them, but
they disregarded their words. Then, Janaki, whose heart was melting with love
for her sons, seeing them ready for battle, said, "O children! This is not the
right time for you to fight. For calves are not put in front of the chariot's
axle." ||30-32|| In response, the two sons said, "Mother! Why did you say that?
What need is there for the old in this? The earth is for the enjoyment of
heroes." ||33|| "What is the use of a large body for a fire that burns? It is
its nature that is the cause of its greatness." ||34|| Seeing her sons speak
thus, Janaki's eyes, filled with mixed emotions, shed a few tears. ||35||
After bathing and taking food, they adorned themselves with ornaments and, with
body, mind, and speech, bowed respectfully to the perfected ones. ||36|| After
paying homage to Savitri and all the learned in the scriptures, they left their
home, accompanied by auspicious omens. ||37|| Then, mounting their chariots,
drawn by swift steeds, and equipped with various weapons, they set out for the
earth. ||38|| Possessing a vast army and considering the bow as their only
companion, the two princes seemed to be embodiments of effort and valor. ||39||
With hearts full of generosity and great enthusiasm for battle, these two,
bearers of great fortune, reached Vajrajab in six days. ||40||   Hearing of the
enemy's army, which was full of effort, and was close at hand, King Prithu, who
was surrounded by a vast army, emerged from his city of Prithvi. ||41|| His
brothers, friends, sons, maternal uncles, and maternal cousins, along with
others who were devoted to him, all set out. ||42||

244 Padmapurana Suja, Anga, Vanga, Magadha, etc., kings of the earth, all with
great strength, set out. ||43|| They were surrounded by chariots, horses,
elephants, and foot soldiers, all enraged and ready to fight. ||44|| Hearing the
sound of the trumpets from the chariots, elephants, and horses, the Vrajangha
chiefs, ready for battle, were also eager to fight. ||45|| Then, when the front
lines of both armies came very close, Lavana and Angkusha, filled with great
enthusiasm, entered the enemy's army. ||46|| These two princes, moving with
great speed, like a great fire, began to play in the great lake of the enemy
army. ||47|| Like lightning, they appeared here and there, then disappeared.
They were so powerful that the enemy could hardly look at them. ||48|| They were
seen taking arrows, stringing them, and releasing them, but they were not seen,
only the slain enemies were seen. ||49|| The earth was covered with fallen
chariots, wounded by sharp arrows, making it very difficult to traverse. ||50||
The enemy army, like madmen, was defeated in the blink of an eye, and the group
of elephants ran here and there, as if frightened by a lion. ||51|| Then, in a
moment, the army of King Prithu, like a river, was dried up by the rays of the
sun, which were like the arrows of Lavana and Angkusha. ||52|| The remaining
warriors, terrified, fled in all directions, like a group of cotton flowers,
without the desire of those princes. ||53|| Prithu, helpless and dejected, was
on the path of defeat, and the princes, with their bows, pursued him and said,
"Oh, vile Naraprith, where are you fleeing now? We two, whose lineage and
character are unknown, have come." ||54-55|| "Why are you not ashamed to flee
from us, whose lineage and character are unknown?" ||56|| "Now, we will show you
our lineage and character with our arrows. Be careful, or you will be forced to
stay." ||57||

245 Having said this, Pṛthu, with folded hands, bowed down and said, "O heroes!
May you forgive my ignorance-born fault." ||5|| "Your greatness has not come
within the reach of my mind, just as the sun's rays do not reach the lotus."
||56|| "It is only for the wise that the introduction of their lineage and
character is appropriate. It is not appropriate for the Bharatyas, for it is
fraught with doubt." ||60|| "Who is the fool who does not know the power of fire
to burn the forest, just by seeing it burn?" ||61|| "You two are the supreme
heroes, born of a great lineage, and you are our masters, bringing us
happiness." ||62|| Thus praised, the two princes bowed their heads, their anger
completely subsided, and their faces were calm. ||63|| Then, when the kings,
headed by Vajrajāṅgha, arrived, there was a friendship between the two heroes
and Pṛthu, in the presence of all. ||64|| "It is true that noble-minded people
are pleased by mere salutations, for the flow of rivers does not uproot the
humble Vetasa plants." ||65|| Then, Pṛthu, with great pomp, brought the two
heroes, who brought joy to all, into the city. ||66|| There, Pṛthu decided to
give his daughter Kanakamalā, adorned with great wealth, to the hero
Madanāṅkaśa. ||67|| Then, the two heroes, skilled in action, spent one night
there and set out from the city to conquer this entire earth. ||68|| Surrounded
by the kings of Suhma, Anga, Magadha, Vanga, and Podanapura, the two princes
were ready to go to Lokākṣanagara. ||69|| With a large army, the two heroes,
happily attacking the many countries connected to it, reached near
Lokākṣanagara. ||70|| Just as the wings of Garuda disturb the serpent, so did
they disturb the king Kubera-kanta, who was proud there. ||71|| "Give it, be
careful to stand up, or you will be forced to stand up." ||57||

In the Padma Purana, In the midst of the four-armed army, in the great
battlefield, Bhima, the greatest of warriors, conquered Kubera-kanta and
advanced, his army growing stronger. ||72|| From there, they went to the Lampaka
country, surrounded by thousands of kings who had submitted to their rule. It
was difficult to travel by land, so they had to travel by boat. ||73|| There,
they defeated the king Ekakarna and, due to the favorable route, both princes
went to the place of victory. ||74|| There, they conquered a hundred brothers by
merely looking at them, crossed the Ganges, and went north towards Kailasa.
||75|| There, they met with the beautiful countries of Nandana, and were honored
by the best of men with various offerings in their hands. ||76|| They subdued
the kings of Bhaskuntala, Kalamba, Nandi, Nandana, Sinhala, Shalabha, Anala,
Chaula, Bhima, and Bhutarava, and went to the other side of the Sindhu. They
also subdued the kings who lived on the other side of the western ocean.
||77-78|| O Shrenika, I will tell you about some of the rulers of Purkheta,
Matamba, and other countries who were subdued by the two princes. ||79|| Some of
these countries were Aryan, some were Mleccha, and some were of both types, with
different customs. ||80|| The rulers of the following countries were conquered:
Bhira, Yavana, Kacha, Ashva, Trijata, Nata, Shaka, Kerala, Nepal, Malava, Arul,
Sharvara, Vrisha, Vaidya, Kashmir, Hidimba, Avashta, Varvara, Trishira,
Parashala, Gaushil, Ushinar, Suryarak, Sanarta, Khasha, Vindhya, Shikhapad,
Mekhala, Shurasen, Vahlika, Ullu, Kosala, Dari, Gandhara, Sauvira, Puri,
Kaubera, Kohara, Andhra, Kala, and Kalinga. They had different languages,
different qualities, different types of jewels and clothes, different types of
trees, different types of mines, and were all adorned with gold and other
wealth. ||81-86|| The people of these various countries, with their great wealth
and devotion, followed the wishes of Lavana and Angusha, and wandered the earth.

A Hundred and More Chapters 317 Those two most excellent men, making the earth
happy, were situated above thousands of great kings. ||8|| Protecting the
countries properly, engaged in various beautiful stories, those two excellent
men, having set out from Paundarika-pura, ||86|| having received great worship
from the rulers of the countries, approached Paundarika-pura. ||30|| Then,
having taken refuge in the seventh floor of the palace, surrounded by excellent
women, enjoying comfortable seats, ||11|| Sita saw the dust rising like a swift,
cloudy, gray cloud, and asked her friends, ||12|| "What is this that is seen,
friends, this fickle, invading direction?" They said, "O Queen, this must be the
dust of the army." ||13|| "Indeed, see, in the middle of this, clear water is
known, like a group of crocodiles swimming, or a group of horses." ||14||
"Surely, O Lord, these two princes have arrived, having accomplished their
purpose. Indeed, those two, the best of the world, are seen." ||15|| Thus, the
story was going on, while Sita's mind was beautiful, when the messengers,
bringing good news, arrived. ||16|| Then, the whole city was adorned, by people
filled with respect, bearing the highest joy. ||17|| Pure flags were raised on
the tops of the ramparts, the roads were made beautiful with divine arches.
||18|| The royal road was filled with fragrant flowers, adorned with beautiful
garlands, step by step. ||19|| Pots with leaves were placed at the gates, and
the market streets were adorned with silk garments, etc. ||20|| It seemed as if
the Vidyadharas, the gods, or Lakshmi herself had created it, Paundarika-pura
became like Ayodhya. ||21|| Seeing those two princes entering with great
splendor, the behavior of the women of the city was indescribable. ||22|| 1. The
whole city was adorned. || 2. With silk garments, etc. ||

248 Padma Purana Seeing her sons, who had achieved their purpose, approaching
her, Sita was as if submerged in the ocean of nectar. ||103|| The two heroes,
who had folded their hands like lotus buds, who were full of respect, who had
bowed their heads, and who were covered in the dust of the army, approached
their mother with great reverence. ||104|| Sita, who was inclined to show
affection for her sons, who was delighted by the lotus-like hands of her sons,
embraced them, touched their heads with her hands, and was filled with supreme
joy. ||105|| They then repeatedly accepted the supreme grace bestowed upon them
by their mother, and like the sun and moon, they continued to perform their
duties in the world, living happily as they should. ||106|| Thus ends the one
hundred and first chapter of the Sri Padma Purana, known as the Arsha, composed
by the Acharya Sri Ravishena, which narrates the conquest of the directions by
Lavana and Angush. ||11|| 1. Siddha-m. | 2. Chu-chumb | 3. Janani Janiti. | 4.

1.  The two men, having attained supreme sovereignty, were the best of men,
standing and giving orders to the exalted kings. 2.  Then Narada, with a face
like the end of time, asked about the whereabouts of Janaki, searching for her,
sorrowful. 3.  Seeing the two heroes, he was honored by them, being given a seat
and treated like a householder-sage. 4.  Then, sitting comfortably, carrying
supreme joy, and looking at them with affection, Narada spoke. 5.  May the
fortune of Rama and Lakshmana, the lords of men, be yours, in every way, soon.
6.  Then they asked, "Who are those, O Lord, Rama and Lakshmana? What are their
qualities and deeds, and from what lineage are they born?" 7.  Then Narada, with
a face filled with wonder, spoke, standing still for a moment, waving his hand.
8.  A man can lift Mount Meru with his arms and swim across the ocean, but no
one is capable of describing the qualities of these two. 9.  Even with infinite
time and infinite tongues, the whole world is not capable of describing their
qualities. 10.  My heart trembles with anxiety, seeing your curiosity, as I am
overwhelmed by the task of answering your question about their qualities. 11.
Still, I will speak of some of their virtues, which are brief and increase
merit, as you have asked. 12.  There was a king named Dasharatha, like the full
moon in the sky of the Ikshvaku dynasty, and like fire for the fuel of evil
deeds. 13.  He was of great brilliance, ruling over the land of Uttara Kosala,
and illuminating the whole world like the sun. 14.  From the mountain king of
men, like rivers of glory, they flowed and merged into the ocean, delighting the
whole world. 15.  His four sons, capable of bearing the burden of the kingdom,
were like good sons, endowed with virtues.

---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, Rama, the eldest son, is described as being beautiful from
all sides, and though he is a knower of all scriptures, he is also known
throughout the world. ||16|| He, along with his younger brother Lakshmana and
his wife Sita, the daughter of King Janaka, who was a devoted wife, protected
the truth of his father, leaving Ayodhya desolate, and wandered the earth in
disguise, eventually entering the Dandaka forest. ||17-18|| There, in a place
that was difficult even for the great Vidyaadharas, they resided, and it was
there that the story of Chandranakha occurred, meaning that Chandranakha
displayed her feminine character. ||19|| Meanwhile, Rama went to the battlefield
to learn about his younger brother, while the deceitful Ravana abducted Sita.
||20|| After that, the lords of Mahendra, Kishkindha, Shrishaila, and Malaya, as
well as the chief monkey kings like Viradhit, who were endowed with great wealth
and possessed great power in the form of knowledge, came to Rama's side, drawn
by their love for his qualities or by their good fortune, and after defeating
Ravana in battle, they brought Sita back. The Vidyaadharas made Ayodhya like a
heavenly city. ||21-23|| Served by supreme wealth, the best of men, Rama and
Lakshmana, enjoyed themselves there, facing each other, like the Nagendra (king
of snakes). ||24|| Or, until now, why have you both not known Rama, whose
younger brother is Lakshmana, who possesses the Sudarshana Chakra, which never
goes in vain? ||25|| Besides this, he has other jewels, each of which is guarded
by thousands of gods with single-minded devotion, and which are the cause of his
kingship. ||26|| He who abandoned Sita for the sake of his people, who is there
in this world who does not know Rama? ||27|| Or, let this world be, even in
heaven, the groups of gods are filled with his qualities, and their minds are
devoted to him. ||28|| Then, Ankusha said, "O sage! Tell me, for what reason did
Rama abandon Sita? I wish to know." ||29|| Then, the sage Satavikṣaṇa, whose
mind was attracted by Rama's qualities, narrated the entire story. ||30||

## The Two Hundred and Two Chapter  A woman of pure lineage, character, and
heart, adorned with virtues, she is the leader of eight thousand women,
extremely wise. ||31|| She has defeated Savitri, Gayatri, Sri, Kirti, Dhriti,
and Devi with her purity, and is equal to the Jain scriptures. ||32|| Surely,
due to the influence of the karmas accumulated in past lives, she was abandoned
in a desolate forest, merely because of public opinion. ||33|| Having attained
growth in happiness, that chaste woman, scorched by the harsh rays of the sun in
the form of wicked people, has probably perished. ||34|| Delicate beings are
prone to suffering even for the slightest reason, just as a garland of jasmine
wilts at the mere touch of a lamp's light. ||35|| What then of Sita, who has
never seen the sun, in a terrifying forest teeming with ferocious beasts? How
can she survive? ||36|| The tongue of a wicked man, like a venomous serpent,
contaminates innocent people. Why doesn't it cease from its evil ways? ||37||
Whoever criticizes a chaste woman like Sita, who is praiseworthy for her
uprightness and purity, will suffer in this world and the next. ||38|| Or, for
those who are always vigilant in destroying the karmas they have accumulated,
what is there to criticize? In this matter, it is the world itself that deserves
condemnation. ||39|| Having said this, the sage, overwhelmed with grief, could
not speak further and resorted to the silence of yoga. ||40|| Then, Ankush,
smiling, said, "O Brahman! By abandoning Sita in a terrifying forest, Rama did
not act in a way befitting his lineage." ||41|| There are many ways to refute
public opinion. Why then did he wound Sita in this way, while they were present?
||42|| Anangalavana, another prince, said, "O Muni! How far is Ayodhya from
here?" In response, Narada, who loved to travel, said, "Ayodhya is sixty yojanas
from here, where Rama, the beloved of the moon-like Priya, resides." ||43-44||
Hearing this, the two princes said, "We will go to them. What is the point of
staying here? What is the importance of this earth, or of anyone else?" ||45||
Tears welled up in Narada's eyes as he finished the story. ||30||

In the Padma Purana, It was said to Vajrajangha, "O Mama! On this earth, all the
kings like Suhma, Sindhu, Kalinga, etc., who are endowed with all resources,
should be commanded to get ready to go to Ayodhya immediately, with all the
things necessary for war." ||46-47|| "Let the great elephants, both those
without pride and those with pride, be assembled. Let the horses, swift as the
wind, with their mighty roar, be brought forth. Let the warriors, renowned for
their valor and not fleeing from battle, be inspected. Let their excellent
weapons be examined, and let their armor and other things be cleaned. Let the
sound of trumpets mixed with the sound of conch shells be given, as a signal for
the commencement of the great battle." ||48-50|| Thus commanded, the kings, who
had come together with joy for the battle, with courage in their hearts and
filled with great joy, stood firm, like the Indras who, having commanded the
gods, are free from worry. ||51-52|| Then, hearing of the coronation of Padma
Nabha, Sita, bearing great anxiety, wept. ||53|| Then, standing near Sita,
Siddhartha said to Narada, "Why have you begun this unseemly act?" ||54|| "You,
who are eager for battle and encourage war, have, by your own actions, caused
this great division in the family." ||55|| Narada said, "I do not know this
story. I only spoke to them about Rama and Lakshmana." ||56|| "Even if this has
happened, do not fear. Nothing unseemly will happen. I know this. Let your mind
be at ease." ||57|| Then, going near her, the two princes said to Sita, "Mother,
why are you weeping? Tell us without delay." ||58|| "Who has done anything
against you, or who has spoken against you? Whose life shall I take away today,
whose heart is filled with evil?" ||59|| "Who is that man, without medicine in
his hand, who plays with snakes? Who is that man, or god, who causes you
sorrow?" ||60|| "Mother, for whose sake are you angry today, whose life is
short? Mother, let your anger subside. Tell us the cause of your sorrow." ||61||

## Chapter Two Hundred and Two  Thus spoken, the goddess Sita, with tearful
eyes, said, "I am not angry with anyone, O lotus-eyed sons."  ||2|| "I am
grieving because I remember your father today.  I am weeping uncontrollably, my
tears flowing like a river." ||63||   When she said this, the two valiant sons
of the Shreniks thought, "Siddhartha is not our father." ||64|| Then they asked,
"Mother, who is our father? Where is he?"  Asked thus, Sita, with a heavy heart,
narrated her entire story. ||65|| She described her own birth, the birth of
Rama, her journey to the forest, her abduction, and her return. ||66|| She
recounted everything in detail, just as the divine sage Narada had narrated it.
For what is the point of concealing the story now? ||67||   Having said this,
Sita said, "When you two were in my womb, your father abandoned me in the forest
out of fear of public opinion." ||68|| "I was weeping in the forest called
Sinharava when Vajrajangha, who had gone to capture elephants, saw me." ||69||
"This Vajrajangha, who had returned after capturing the elephant, was a great
soul, a Shravaka, a pure gem of virtue, and compassionate. ||70|| He addressed
me as his sister, brought me to his own place, and cared for me with great
respect." ||71|| "It is in the magnificent house of this Vajrajangha, who is
like your father, that I gave birth to you two, born from the body of
Padmanabha." ||72|| "This entire earth, from the Himalayas to the ocean, is
ruled by Rama, your elder brother, and he has made this earth his servant."
||73|| "Now, a great battle is about to take place between you and him.  What
ill-omened news should I hear?  Should I hear about the misfortune of your
father, or yours, or your brother-in-law?" ||74|| "It is this worry that has
filled my heart with sorrow, and I am weeping.  What other reason could there
be, my dear sons?" ||75||   Hearing this, Lavana and Angusha were overjoyed and
surprised.  Their faces blossomed like lotuses.  They said, "Oh! That Sudhanva,
the best of men, the glorious one, the one with vast and brilliant fame...

254 Padmapurana "Oh, that is our father, Sudhanva, the best of men. He is
glorious, with vast fame, and has performed many great wonders." ||77|| "Mother,
do not grieve over being abandoned in the forest. You will soon see the pride of
Rama and Lakshmana shattered." ||78|| "My sons, do not oppose your father. It is
not right to do so. Be calm." ||79|| "My dear sons, go with great humility and
pay your respects to your father. This is the righteous path." ||80|| "Mother,
how can we go and speak to him, saying, 'We are your sons,' when we have reached
the place of our enemy?" ||81|| "It is better for us to die in the midst of
battle than to harbor such a thought, which would be condemned by valiant men."
||82|| "Seeing Sita silent and her mind filled with sorrow, Lavana and Angusha
performed the ablutions and other rituals." ||83|| "Then, having served the
assembly of auspicious sages, having paid their respects to the perfected ones,
and having comforted their mother and bowed to her, the two princes, adorned
with auspicious garments, mounted two elephants, just as the moon and the sun
mount the peaks of mountains. Then, they set out for Ayodhya, just as Rama and
Lakshmana had set out for Lanka." ||84-85|| "Then, hearing the sound of
preparations, knowing that they were leaving, thousands of warriors quickly
marched out of Paundarika." ||86|| "There was a great clash between the kings,
each showing off their armies, their minds filled with mutual rivalry." ||87||
"The two brothers, accompanied by a vast army that stretched for a yojana,
protected the earth, adorned with various grains, their glorious prowess
preceding them, and worshipped by the kings established in their respective
lands." ||88-89|| "Ten thousand men, wielding large axes and shovels, marched
ahead of them." ||90|| "They cut down trees and other things, creating a smooth,
mirror-like earth, with hills and valleys." ||91|| 1. Sudhanvi M. 2.

255 First went the treasure-bearing buffaloes, camels, and large bulls. Then
went the chariot attendants, making soft sounds.  After them went the groups of
foot soldiers, leaping like young deer, and following them were groups of
horses, performing excellent feats.  Then came the kings adorned with golden
garlands, with large bells tied around their necks, making a sound, holding
conch shells and whisks.  They were very proud, with their attire adorned with
glass beads, mirrors, and torches.  Their white horses were adorned with iron,
copper, and gold.  They were adorned with necklaces of jewels and pearls, and
they looked like moving mountains, with various colored paintings.  Some had
excessive intoxication flowing from their cheeks, some had closed eyes, some
were filled with joy, some were about to become intoxicated, some were sharp
with speed, and some were like clouds.  They were protected by men skilled in
various weapons, making great sounds, and very bright.  They were knowledgeable
about the sounds made by their own and enemy armies, and they were well-versed
in all kinds of education, and they were elephants with beautiful movements.
After them went the horsemen, adorned with beautiful armor, with shields hung
behind them, and spears in their hands.  The sky was filled with dust raised by
the hooves of the horse groups, as if it were filled with groups of white
clouds.  After them went the foot soldiers, covered in the darkness of weapons,
performing various feats, arrogant, and with noble conduct.  In that vast army,
no one was unhappy with beds, seats, betel nut, fragrance, garlands, beautiful
clothes, food, and ointments, i.e., all these things were available to everyone.
Men appointed by the king's command were constantly present on the path, very
efficient, always ready to act, and with good hearts.  They offered honey,
sugar, ghee, water, and various other delicious things to everyone, with the
utmost respect.  They were making the high and low ground level, like mirrors,
all around.

256 Padmapurana There was no one in that army who was dirty, poor, hungry,
thirsty, wearing shabby clothes, or worried. ||106|| In that ocean-like army,
men and women adorned with various ornaments, dressed in fine clothes, and with
beautiful complexions, were resplendent. ||107|| Thus, endowed with supreme
glory, the two sons of Janaka reached the kingdom of Ayodhya, just as Indra
reaches the abode of the gods. ||108|| The land there is adorned with the finest
crops like barley, paddy, sugarcane, and wheat. ||109|| The rivers there are
adorned with flocks of royal swans, the ponds with lotuses and water lilies, the
mountains with various flowers, and the gardens with beautiful music. ||110||
The forests there are adorned with the sounds of large bulls, herds of beautiful
cows and buffaloes, and cowherds sitting on platforms. ||111|| The villages
situated on the borders are like cities, and the cities are like the city of
Trivishtap. ||112|| Enjoying the objects of the five senses at will, Lavana-
Angusha, endowed with supreme energy, went happily to that beloved land. ||113||
Due to the battle, the water flowing from the temples of the enraged elephants
made all the dust on the path muddy. ||114|| The sharp hooves of the restless
horses made the soft land of Kosala appear as if it were in a state of utter
ruin. ||115|| Then, seeing the sky from afar, adorned with a group of evening
clouds, Lavana-Angusha said, "Oh Mam! What is this that I see, with its bright
red, vast radiance, rising so high?" Hearing this, Vajrajangha, after
recognizing it for a long time, said, "Oh Deva! This is the excellent city of
Ayodhya, whose golden walls are shining so brightly." ||116-118|| In this city,
resides the glorious Balabhadra, who is your father, and Narayana and the
virtuous Shatrughna, who are his brothers. ||119|| Thus, filled with stories of
valor and courage, they happily went along, and a river flowed between them.
||120|| They continued to offer honey, delicious drinks, ghee, water, and
various kinds of juicy food to everyone with great respect. ||104-105||

## Chapter Two Hundred and Two  **25.**  The river appeared between the two
heroes, who were eager to capture the city, just as thirst arises for one who is
about to attain liberation.  ||12||  The army, weary from the journey, was
stationed near the river, like the great army of the gods near the river
Nandana. ||122||  Hearing of the enemy army stationed nearby, Rama and Lakshmana
were filled with wonder. ||123||  "Who is this mortal who desires death so
quickly, approaching us under the pretext of war?" ||124||  Narayana immediately
commanded Viradhit, the king, "Prepare the army for war without delay." ||125||
"Let the Vidhyadhara kings, bearing the banners of Vrupa, Naga, and Vanara, be
informed of the impending battle." ||126||  "As you command," said Viradhit, the
king of the birds, and summoning the kings, including Sugriva, he prepared for
war. ||127||  Upon seeing the messenger, all the Vidhyadhara kings, with their
vast armies, arrived in Ayodhya. ||128||  Meanwhile, Siddhartha and Narada,
their hearts filled with anxiety, quickly informed Prabhammandala of the
situation. ||129||  Hearing of Sita's plight, Prabhammandala, filled with
paternal love, was overcome with sorrow. ||130||  Filled with grief, wonder, and
joy, Prabhammandala, with his father, quickly boarded a celestial chariot, as
swift as thought, and, accompanied by his entire army, set out for Paundarika-
pura, his heart filled with love. ||131-132||  Seeing Prabhammandala, her
father, and mother, Sita, whose grief was renewed, rose quickly and embraced
them all, tears streaming down her face. She lamented, overwhelmed by the pain
of her abandonment and other sorrows. ||133-134||  Prabhammandala, with great
difficulty, comforted her, saying, "O Devi! Your sons have done well.

25 Papupuran Because they had gone to those two, Halachakra Dharas, and
disturbed them, they were heroes even among the gods, and they were not
conquerable, the best of men. ||136|| As long as there is no carelessness in
those two Kumaris, let us quickly go and think about protection. ||137|| Then,
with her daughters-in-law, Sita, riding in a celestial chariot, went towards
where her two sons, endowed with the strength of Vajra, had gone. ||138|| Then,
Gautam Swami says, "O Shrenik! Who is capable of describing the full Lakshmi of
Rama and Lakshmana? Therefore, listen to this brief description." ||139||
Surrounded by a vast ocean of chariots, horses, elephants, and foot soldiers,
Rama and Lakshmana emerged, as if bearing anger. ||140|| Shatrughna, the
powerful one, riding in a chariot drawn by horses, with his chest adorned with
garlands, emerged, his mind set on war. ||141|| Just as the Harinakeshi god is
the leader of the army, so too, Mani, with his face like that of Krtaanta, was
the leader of all the armies. ||142|| His immeasurable army, with its shadow
created by bows and arrows, and adorned with great brilliance, was increasing
his prowess. ||143|| His great chariot, with a central pillar resembling a
divine palace, and a flag of Yama, was shining, difficult to look at for the
enemy army. ||144|| Behind Krtaanta, there was Trimurdha, then Agnishikha, then
Singhavikrama, then Dirghabahu, then Singhodara, Sumeru, the powerful
Balikhilya, the extremely angry Raudrabhuti, Sharabha, Syandana, the angry
Vanakarna, Maridatta, who loved war, and Mrigendravahan, with his mind filled
with intoxication, and other five thousand vassals emerged. All these vassals
were bearing darkness in the form of various weapons, and groups of charanas
were singing the praises of their countless virtues. ||145-148|| In the same
way, the many ranks of the Kumaris, who were accompanied by deceitful armies,
who had cast their gaze for a moment upon the weapons that had proven their
worth, whose enthusiasm was increasing due to the joy of war, who were devoted
to their lord, who were powerful, who were swift, and who had shaken the earth,
also emerged. ||149-150|| Some of them were on chariots, some were on tall
elephants, some were like dense clouds of arrows, and others were on horses,
like waves of a great ocean. ||151||

254 Many, whose faces were turned away from the directions due to the loud noise
of the enemy, who were adorned with shields and helmets, whose minds were filled
with anger, and whose servants were of the past, extremely valiant, and eager to
gain happiness, went out mounted on chariots as high as mountains, on elephants
like clouds, on horses like ocean waves, on palanquins with peaks, and on
extremely worthy bulls. ||151-153|| Then, hearing the sound of the enemy army
and filled with confusion, Vajrajas instructed his own army to be ready. ||154||
Then, hearing the sound of the enemy army, all the soldiers, covered with armor,
etc., were ready and came to the battlefield themselves. ||155|| The fierce-
bodied, fierce-limbed, Nepal, Barbar, Paundra, Magadha, Sausna, Parashala,
Sinhala, Kalinka, and Ratnaka, etc., mighty kings, with eleven thousand,
equipped with excellent energy, were ready for battle. ||156-157|| Thus, that
army, which had turned its face towards the enemy army, and in which weapons
were moving, attained a great battle formation, i.e., there was a fierce
encounter between the two armies. ||158|| There was such a terrible encounter
between the two armies, which was even more wonderful than the previous
encounter between the gods and demons, and was making a great sound like the
encounter of two oceans that had been stirred up. ||159|| "Oh, you insignificant
one! Strike first, give up your weapon, why are you neglecting? My weapon never
gets ready to strike first." ||160|| "Oh, he struck lightly, so my arm remained
healthy, i.e., nothing happened to it, strike hard on the body with a firm
fist." ||161|| "Come forward a little, the arrow is not moving properly in the
battle, or else give up the arrow and take up the dagger." ||162|| "Why are you
trembling? I will not kill you, leave the path, this other valiant warrior,
agile like a spark from the great fire of battle, is standing in front." ||163||
"Oh, you insignificant one! Why are you roaring in vain? There is no power in
your words, I am worshipping the battle by your efforts." ||164|| Thus, from the
mouths of the valiant warriors, very deep, great sounds were coming out all
around. ||165|| 1. Kaalanalaah prachudaanga-m०, j० । 2. Tejasah m० । 3. Vartate

## Padma Purana, Chapter 1  166. Just as a terrifying sound arose from the
earthly kings, so too did a great sound arise from the celestial kings.  167.
Bhamandala, the valiant Pavanavega, the brilliant Mrganga like lightning, and
Devachanda, the representative of the great Vidyaadhara kings, all equipped with
large armies and skilled in great battles, stood on the side of Lavanaankusha.
168. Having heard of the true origin of Lavanaankusha, Hanuman, who was
extremely knowledgeable in the application of the knowledge of duty, weakened
the clash of the celestial kings and joined the side of Lavanaankusha.  169.
Holding the weapon called Langul, Hanuman emerged from Rama's army, filling
Bhamandala's heart with joy.  170. Seeing Janaki seated on the top of the
chariot, all the celestial kings became indifferent.  171. They folded their
hands and bowed to her with great respect, standing around her, filled with
immense wonder.  172. Seeing the clash of the two armies, Sita's eyes became
restless like those of a frightened deer, her body trembled, and she felt a
shiver.  173. Then, shaking that vast army with its fluttering flags,
Lavanaankusha, the bearer of Padma Lakshmi, advanced towards Rama and Lakshmana.
174. Thus, the two Kumaras, Singh and Garuda, bearing their respective flags,
stood before Rama and Lakshmana, their faces filled with hostility.  175. As
soon as he arrived, Anangalavana, wielding his weapon, cut down Ramadeva's flag
and shattered his bow.  176. Laughing, Rama was about to take up another bow
when the valiant Lavana swiftly disarmed him.  177. Then, the powerful and
valiant Rama, with furrowed brows, mounted another chariot and, filled with
anger, moved towards Anangalavana.  178. With eyes as unfathomable as the summer
sun, Rama, raising his bow, approached Anangalavana just as the Asura Kumaras
approached Indra, the lord of the thunderbolt.

261 The son of Janaki, Ananga-Lavaṇa, raised his bow with arrows and approached
Padmanabha to give him a taste of the battle. ||18|| Then there was a fierce
battle between Padmanabha and Lavaṇa, a clash of weapons, harsh and terrible.
||182|| Just as there was a great battle between Padmanabha and Lavaṇa, so too
was there a great battle between Lakṣmaṇa and Aṅkuśa. ||183|| Thus there was a
duel between the lords, who were eager for their own glory, and their followers,
who were eager for the glory of their own heroes. ||184|| In one place, a group
of horses, their hooves churning the ground like waves, were held back by the
enemy's chariot, making the battlefield dense. ||185|| In another place, a
warrior, his armor broken, saw the enemy standing before him, and, filled with
the dust of battle, turned his face away. ||186|| Some warriors, abandoning
their lord, entered the enemy's ranks, calling out the names of their lords and
slaying those they saw. ||187|| Some proud, arrogant warriors, ignoring men,
were engaged in battle with maddened elephants, their tusks dripping with blood.
||188|| One valiant warrior, taking refuge in the tusks of a maddened elephant,
found the supreme pleasure of battle-sleep, that is, he was killed by the
elephant's tusks. ||189|| One valiant warrior, whose weapon was broken, did not
give way to the oncoming horse, but struck his hand against it and gave up his
life. ||190|| One warrior, who had fallen in the first attack, was still being
struck by a valiant warrior, even though he was begging for mercy. ||191|| One
warrior, whose weapon had fallen, but whose spirit had not, abandoned his weapon
and prepared to fight with his bare arms. ||192|| Those who were known for their
generosity, always valiant in battle, gave up their lives, but never turned
their backs. ||193|| The chariot of one charioteer was bogged down in blood and
mud, and though he was eager to whip his horses, he could not move quickly.
||194|| Thus, in that great battle, the chariots, drawn by horses that made a
loud noise, were moving quickly, their wheels making a loud noise. ||195||

262 Padma Purana The battlefield was filled with the sound of war elephants, the
roar of warriors, and the cries of the wounded. The air was thick with the smell
of blood and smoke. The ground was littered with the bodies of the fallen. The
battle raged on, a whirlwind of steel and fire.  The warriors fought with a
ferocity that was born of desperation. They knew that their lives were on the
line, and they were determined to fight to the death. The battle was a spectacle
of chaos and carnage.  The elephants, with their massive tusks and thick hides,
were a formidable force. They charged into the enemy ranks, trampling everything
in their path. The warriors, armed with swords, spears, and bows, fought back
with all their might.  The battle raged on for hours, neither side gaining the
upper hand. Finally, as the sun began to set, the tide of the battle turned. The
warriors of the righteous side, led by their valiant king, began to push back
the enemy.  The enemy, demoralized and exhausted, began to retreat. The warriors
of the righteous side pursued them, driving them back to their own lands.  The
battle was over. The righteous side had won a decisive victory. The king, his
face grim but his eyes filled with pride, surveyed the battlefield. He knew that
the victory had come at a great cost. Many of his warriors had fallen, and the
land was stained with blood.  But he also knew that the victory was worth the
price. He had saved his kingdom from the enemy, and he had brought peace to his
people.  The king, his heart heavy with grief but his spirit filled with hope,
turned to his people and said, "We have won this battle, but the war is not
over. We must remain vigilant, for the enemy will surely return. But we will be
ready for them. We will fight for our freedom, for our families, and for our
land. We will never surrender!"  The people cheered, their voices filled with
hope and determination. They knew that their king was a just and righteous
ruler, and they were confident that he would lead them to victory.  The battle
was over, but the war was just beginning. The king and his people knew that they
had a long and difficult road ahead of them, but they were determined to fight
for their freedom. They would never surrender.  The battle was a testament to
the courage and determination of the human spirit. It was a reminder that even
in the darkest of times, hope can prevail.  The battle was a story of victory,
but it was also a story of loss. It was a story of the human cost of war. It was
a story that would be told for generations to come.  The battle was a story that
would never be forgotten.

## Chapter One Hundred and Three  The wise Gautama Swami said to King Shrenik,
"O King of Magadha, be attentive, for I will now describe the battle in detail."
The charioteer of the ocean-like Alangala-lavaṇa was Vajrajangha, the renowned
warrior of Madanankuśa was Prithu, the son of Chandrodara, the son of Sumitra,
was Viradhit, and the charioteer of Indra, who was like Rama, was the sun-like
Kritantavaktra.  With a loud roar, Rama, lifting the bow called Vanavarta, spoke
to the commander of the Kritantavaktra army in a deep voice, "O Kritantavaktra,
quickly drive your chariot towards the enemy. Why are you so sluggish, making
your body heavy and weak?"  Hearing this, Kritantavaktra said, "O God, look at
these horses, shattered by the arrows of this warrior. Are they succumbing to
sleep, or are they free from all ailments, becoming sluggish?"  "They are not
responding to hundreds of sweet words, nor to being struck with palms. They are
stretching their bodies, making a great noise, and moving quickly. They are
staining the earth red with streams of blood, as if showing their great
affection for you."  "And look here, my arms, pierced by arrows that pierce
armor, have become like garlands of blooming Kadamba flowers."  Hearing this,
Rama also said, "My bow is also becoming weak, and like a painted bow, it is
becoming useless."  "This mace-jewel has become useless, and the heavy arm-staff
is causing pain due to the Sunavarta bow."  "This halberd-jewel of mine, which
had subdued many enemy elephants, has become useless."  "Such is the fate of
even the most powerful weapons, capable of destroying the enemy and protecting
their own side."

## English Translation:  **264** **Padma Purana**  Just as the weapons of the
undefeated one, the son of Kausalya, became useless, so too did the weapons of
Lakshmana become useless in the face of Madanankusha. ||15||  Gautama Swami says
that on the one hand, Rama and Lakshmana were aware of their kinship with
Lavanaankusha, and thus fought with restraint, taking care not to inflict fatal
blows. On the other hand, Rama and Lakshmana were unaware of Madanankusha's
lineage, and thus fought without restraint. ||16||  Despite his weapons being
rendered ineffective, Lakshmana, armed with divine weapons, remained undeterred.
He unleashed a barrage of spears, chakra, and arrows upon Madanankusha, who
countered the attack with a shower of vajra-dandas and arrows. Similarly,
Anangalavana had countered Rama's onslaught of weapons. ||17-18||  Subsequently,
Lavana wounded Rama with a spear near his chest, while the valiant Madanankusha,
skilled in combat, struck Lakshmana. ||19||  Seeing Lakshmana, whose eyes and
heart were spinning from the blow, Viradhit, overwhelmed with fear, turned his
chariot back towards Ayodhya. ||20||  Regaining consciousness, Lakshmana, his
eyes blazing with anger, saw the chariot turned away and exclaimed, "O Viradhit,
you fool! What have you done? Turn the chariot back immediately! Do you not know
that one does not retreat in battle?" ||21-22||  It is noble for a valiant
warrior, whose body is riddled with arrows, to die facing his enemy, but this
cowardly act is despicable. ||23||  How can those who are the leaders of men,
who stand at the head of the human race, succumb to fear even when faced with
the greatest adversity, amidst gods and men? ||24||  I am the son of Dasharatha,
the brother of Rama, and known as Narayana on earth. How can such an act be
fitting for him? ||25||  Thus, Lakshmana's words swiftly turned the chariot
back, and a fierce battle ensued, with the enemy forces returning to the fray.
||26||  Driven by anger, Lakshmana, desiring to end the battle, unleashed a
powerful chakra, a weapon that strikes fear into the hearts of gods and demons.

## The Vyuttarashatam Parva (Chapter 365)  **28.** The blazing, unbearable, sun-
like wheel, wielded by the enraged Lakshmana, was aimed to strike the Ankusha.
**26.** Approaching the Ankusha, the wheel lost its brilliance and returned to
Lakshmana's hand.  **30.** Lakshmana, filled with anger, repeatedly hurled the
wheel towards the Ankusha, but it kept returning to him.  **31.** Seeing this,
the valiant Ankusha Kumar, in a state of utter confusion, whirled his bow and
arrow.  **32.** Witnessing this, all the warriors on the battlefield were filled
with wonder and doubt.  **33.** "This is the supreme being, the wielder of the
wheel, who has now appeared. His spinning wheel has thrown us all into
confusion."  **34.** "Is this wheel stationary or in motion? Its thunderous roar
is deafening."  **35.** "This wheel, known for its characteristics like the
Kotishila, seems to be a delusion. How can it have appeared here for someone
else?"  **36.** "How can the words of the Munis be false? Are the teachings of
the Jina also meaningless?"  **37.** "This bow is spinning, and the sound is
'Chakra' (wheel). The hearts of those who had lost their minds were filled with
anxiety."  **38.** Seeing Lakshmana's shame and inaction, the valiant Lakshmana,
bearing the supreme strength, declared, "These two are indeed Balabhadra and
Narayana."  **39.** Approaching Lakshmana, Siddhartha, with the approval of
Narada, said, "O God, Narayana, you are here, how else could it be? The
teachings of the Jina are unwavering, even more so than Mount Meru."  **40.**
"These two Kumaras are the sons of Janaki, named Lavana and Ankusha. They were
abandoned in the forest while still in her womb."  **41.** "I know that after
abandoning Janaki, you fell into the ocean of sorrow. You are..."  **42.** "The
fear-inducing, infallible Chakra-ratna (wheel-jewel) was lifted."

In the Padma Purana, after knowing the greatness of the Lavanaankusha,
Lakshmana, who was emaciated by grief, gave up his armor and weapons. ||43||
Hearing this account, Rama, who was burdened with sorrow, abandoned his bow and
armor, his eyes rolling, remembering the past sorrow, descended from the chariot
with great speed, and fell to the ground, his eyes closed due to
unconsciousness. ||44-45|| Then, after being sprinkled with sandalwood-mixed
water, he regained consciousness and, with a heart filled with love, quickly
went to his sons. ||46||  Then, filled with love, both sons descended from the
chariot, folded their hands, and bowed their heads to their father's feet.
||47|| After that, Rama, whose heart was melted with love and whose happiness
seemed like a dark day due to tears, embraced both sons and began to lament.
||48|| He said, "Alas, my sons! When you were in the womb, I, with my foolish
mind, abandoned you both, innocent children, in the terrible forest along with
Sita. ||49|| Alas, my sons! Even though you were born to me due to great merit,
how did you both, while still in the womb, attain supreme sorrow in the forest?
||50|| Alas, my sons! If that Vajrajangha had not been in that forest at that
time, how could I have seen this full moon, your face? ||51|| Alas, my sons! The
fact that you were not killed by those infallible weapons indicates that the
gods or your own great merit protected you. ||52|| Alas, my sons! Seeing you
both, fallen by arrows and on the battlefield, I don't know what Janaki would
do. ||53|| The sorrow of exile and abandonment is unbearable even for other
humans, so what would be the state of Sita, a virtuous woman, abandoned by her
sons? ||54|| Knowing that you both, my noble sons, are no more, Sita,
overwhelmed with grief, would surely not live. ||55|| Lakshmana, whose eyes were
filled with tears and who was bewildered and distraught with grief, bowed his
head in humility, his heart filled with love. ||56||

## The Hundredth Chapter of the Dhyuttar Shatam  The kings, led by Shatrughna,
having heard this news, all went to that place and attained supreme joy. ||5.7||
Then, a gathering took place between the two armies, the masters of both armies,
filled with joy and wonder, met. ||58|| Seeing the greatness of her sons and
their reunion, Sita, with a resolute heart, returned to Pundarika in her
celestial chariot. ||56||   Then, filled with excitement, the lord of the
celestial realm descended from the sky and, with tearful eyes, embraced his two
nephews, who were free from wounds. ||60|| Hanuman, eager to express his joy,
embraced them both, repeatedly uttering the words, "Well done!" ||61||
Similarly, Viradhit and Sugriva attained a happy reunion, and kings like
Vibhishana were eager to converse with the princes. ||62||   Then, a gathering
took place, as crowded as the gods, of the earth-dwellers and the celestial
beings, a gathering that gave rise to immense joy. ||63||   Having attained the
supreme joy of the reunion with his sons, Rama, whose heart was filled with
courage, bore the supreme Lakshmi. ||64||   Having attained an indescribable
state, Rama considered the gain of those noble sons to be far more beautiful
than the kingdom of the three worlds. ||65||   The wives of the celestial beings
danced with great joy in the sky, which was like a courtyard, and the wives of
the earth-dwellers danced on the earth, like a frenzied world. ||66||   Filled
with joy, his eyes blooming, Narayana considered himself fulfilled and believed
he had conquered the entire world. ||67||   "I am Sagara, and these two are the
valiant Bhima and Bhagiratha," thus, with a mind filled with comparisons,
Lakshmana bore the supreme radiance. ||68||   Bearing supreme joy, Rama honored
the forest-dweller, saying, "You, with your beautiful heart, are like the entire
celestial sphere to me." ||69||   Then, Ayodhya, already like heaven, was made
even more beautiful. ||70||   She, who was naturally beautiful, with her special
skills and knowledge, was honored by the kings for her conduct, which was the
epitome of virtue. ||71||

268 Pashna Purana Then, Rama, along with his sons, ascended the Pushpaka Vimana,
which was situated on the back of the elephant-shaped mountain, and shone like
the sun. ||72|| Just as a great cloud, accompanied by lightning, sits on the
peak of Mount Sumeru, so too, Lakshmana, adorned with excellent ornaments, sat
on the same Pushpaka Vimana. ||73|| Thus, they all proceeded slowly, seeing the
gardens, temples, and fortresses filled with flags outside the city. ||74|| The
roads of the city, filled with elephants, horses, chariots, and foot soldiers,
whose three places were filled with intoxication, were darkened by bows, flags,
and umbrellas. ||75|| The windows of the palaces were filled with a group of
beautiful women, filled with great curiosity to see Lavana and Ankusha. ||76||
The generous-hearted women, who were eager to drink the nectar of Lavana and
Ankusha with their eyes, were not satisfied. ||77|| The women who were looking
at them, with their minds fixed on one thing, did not even notice that their
necklaces and earrings had fallen off due to the jostling of the crowd. ||78||
Mother, please move your face away from here, don't I have any curiosity? Oh,
you who are always curious, how much is your selfishness? ||79|| Friend, please
lower your head a little out of kindness. Why are you standing so stiffly? Move
your braid from here. ||80|| Oh, lifeless one! Oh, you with a distracted mind!
Why are you tormenting others like this? Don't you see this tormented girl in
front of you? ||81|| Move aside, I have fallen, why are you becoming unconscious
like this? Why don't you see the prince? ||82|| Alas, mother! What kind of woman
is this? What is the use to you if I see her? Why do you stop my inspirer?
||83|| These two princes, who are sitting on either side of Rama, are Lavana and
Ankusha, who have foreheads like the crescent moon. ||84|| Who is Ananga Lavana
and who is Madana Ankusha among them? Oh! Both these princes are very similar in
appearance. ||85|| The one who wears a red armor, dyed with the color of pure
silver, is Lavana, and the one who wears a parrot-colored garment is Ankusha.

The One Hundred and Third Chapter Oh, how virtuous is Sita, whose sons are so
excellent! Oh, how blessed is the woman who will be their wife! ||87|| Thus,
many stories were being told, captivating the minds and ears of those women
whose eyes were fixed on the one. ||88|| None of them noticed that her cheek,
which had been struck by the force of the collision, was wounded by the serpent-
like earring. ||8|| Due to the pressure of another woman's arm, someone's breast
was raised within the tight bodice, shining like the moon with clouds. ||60||
One woman's anklet fell off, but she didn't notice, but when she turned back,
she stumbled and fell because of the same anklet. ||61|| Someone's garment was
torn by the sharp teeth of a spider, and an old woman was telling someone about
it. ||62|| When someone's mind was distracted, and their body became weak, their
dangling arm fell from the force of the shock. ||63|| Someone's necklace,
entangled in another woman's ear ornament, broke and fell, scattering like a
garland of flowers. ||64|| The eyes of some women remained unblinking as they
looked at the two princes, and they remained unblinking even when the princes
were far away. ||65|| Malini Vritta Thus, from the mountain-like mansions, the
dust from the fallen flowers of the vine-like women, turned the sky a dusky
color. The glorious kings, Rama and the others, entered the auspicious palace,
which was extremely beautiful. ||66|| Drut Vilambit Vritta The people, whose
minds are awakened by the sun of virtue, enjoy this kind of festival, which is
beyond compare, and is the gathering of beloved beings. ||67|| Thus ends the One
Hundred and Third Chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the Rama-Lavana-Ankusha
Samagama, narrated by the sage Sri Vishena Acharya. ||103|| Lavana is the one
who holds, and Ankusha is the one who wears green clothes like the wings of a
parrot. ||6||

Chapter One Hundred and Four  Then, on another day, the king, Haladhara, was
informed.  He was accompanied by the chieftains, Marunandan, Sugriva, and
Vibhishana. ||1||  "O Lord, be pleased.  Janaka's daughter is in distress in
another land.  Let an order be given to bring her back." ||2|| Sighing deeply
and warmly, he pondered for a moment.  Then, with a face darkened by tears,
Padmaabha spoke. ||3|| "I know Sita's character to be pure and her mind noble.
But how can I look upon her face, since she has been subject to slander?" ||4||
"Let Janaki first convince the entire world.  Only then can we live with her,
there is no other way." ||5|| "Therefore, in this world, let the kings, along
with the people of their lands, and all the celestial beings, be invited with
great love." ||6|| "Let Sita, born of a blameless lineage, be declared pure,
like Sachi, after taking an oath in front of them, according to proper
procedure." ||7|| "So be it," they said, accepting the proposal without delay.
Kings were gathered from all lands and all directions. ||8|| People from various
lands, including children, elders, and women, arrived in Ayodhya, filled with
great curiosity. ||9|| Even women who had never seen the sun came there, filled
with confusion.  What then can be said of ordinary people? ||10|| Those who were
very old, experts in many stories, renowned leaders of nations, and others, all
came together. ||11|| At that time, the vast crowd, moving together, turned the
entire earth into a path, in all directions. ||12|| The masses arrived on
horses, chariots, bulls, palanquins, and various other vehicles. ||13||
Celestial beings were arriving from above, and earth-bound creatures from below.
At that time, the world seemed to be moving, as if it were alive. ||14||

##  English Translation:  **15.**  Beautifully crafted play-mountains, with four
hundred and twenty-seven (271) pavilions, were built.  Vast and magnificent
halls, adorned with fine cloth-canopies, were erected.   **16.**  Palaces,
adorned with spacious verandahs, were built, supported by pillars, and
embellished with elegant latticework.  **17.**  Women stood with women, and men
with men, all eager to witness the oath, arranged according to their status.
**18.**  The royal officials provided all comforts for the visitors, including
beds, seats, betel nut, food, and garlands.  **19.**  Then, at Rama's command,
Vibhishana, the son of the wind, the king of Kishkindha, Sugriva, Viradha, and
Ratnajaati, all great and powerful kings, reached Paundarika-pura in an instant,
traveling through the sky.  **20.**  They left their armies outside, and
accompanied by their inner circle, entered Sita's abode, having been informed
and granted permission.  **21.**  Upon entering, they raised shouts of victory
for Sita, offered floral tributes, joined their hands, bowed their heads, and
prostrated themselves at her feet.  **22.**  They sat down on the earth, adorned
with beautiful, gem-studded carpets, and engaged in conversation, bowing
respectfully in the presence of the queen.  **23.**  Sita, her eyes filled with
tears, spoke in a low voice, her words mostly filled with self-reproach.
**24.**  She said, "My body, scorched by the fire of the wicked's words, finds
no solace even in the waters of the ocean of milk."  **25.**  Then they said, "O
Devi! O Bhagavati! O Uttama! O Saumya! Let go of your sorrow now, and bring your
mind back to its natural state."  **26.**  "Who in this world would dare to
speak ill of you? Who can move the earth, or drink the fire's flame?  **27.**
"Who has the audacity to lift Mount Meru? Who, with a foolish tongue, would lick
the bodies of the moon and the sun?  **28.**  "Who is capable of moving the
mountain of your virtues? Whose tongue can be shattered into a thousand pieces
by slander?"  **29.**  "We have appointed a group of servants in the land of
Bharata, with the order to kill anyone who dares to speak ill of the Devi."

## Padma Purana  **31.** Even the most lowly person on earth, who is devoted to
the story of Sita's virtues, will be showered with jewels in the home of the
virtuous.  **32.** Driven by their love, the people of the fields, seeking
prosperity in their crops, establish her in their mounds of grain. (Meaning:
People believe that establishing Sita in their mounds of grain will lead to a
bountiful harvest.)  **33.** O Devi! Ramachandra has sent this Pushpaka Vimana
for you. Be pleased and ascend it. Go and proceed towards Ayodhya.  **34.** Just
as a tree without vines, a house without lamps, and the sky without the moon are
not beautiful, so too, Rama, Ayodhya, and the land are not beautiful without
you.  **35.** O Maithili! See your husband's face, radiant like the full moon,
soon. O Kovide! You must surely accept your husband's word.  **36.** Thus spoken
to, Sita, adorned with a hundred excellent women, ascended the Pushpaka Vimana
and, with great splendor, sped through the sky.  **37.** Then, as she saw
Ayodhya, the sun set. Thus, filled with anxiety, she spent the night in the
garden called Mahendrodya.  **38.** The garden that had seemed so beautiful to
her when she was with Rama, now seemed unsuitable, as she remembered the past
events.  **39.** Then, as if by the pure love of Sita, the sun rose, adorning
the entire world with its rays, like servants. And as if by an oath, darkness,
like a liar, was overcome with fear and perished. Sita then proceeded towards
Rama.  **40.** She mounted an elephant whose radiance was diminished by her own
anxiety. She was like a great medicinal herb, illuminated by the sun's rays,
situated on the peak of a mountain, though lacking its own brilliance.  **41.**
Yet, surrounded by noble women, filled with good intentions, Sita, slender and
graceful, shone brightly, like the moon's orb surrounded by stars.  **42.**
Then, Sita, the courageous wife of Rama, entered the vast, solemn, and
respectful assembly, where she was worshipped and praised by all.  **43.** The
sea of people, filled with sorrow, wonder, joy, and peace, cried out in unison,
"May you prosper, O daughter of Janaka, and never grow old!"

## Chapter One Hundred and Four  **Oh!** How glorious is the form of Sita, the
daughter of the noble King Janaka! **Oh!** How glorious is her courage! **Oh!**
How glorious is her strength! **Oh!** How glorious is her radiance! **Oh!** How
glorious is her magnanimity! **Oh!** How glorious is her profound wisdom!
**Oh!** How glorious is her spotless purity, made evident by her return!
||45-46||  Thus, from the mouths of men and women, adorned with joyous bodies,
words filled the entire space between the directions. ||47||  In the sky, the
celestial beings, and on earth, the earth-dwellers, all stood with intense
curiosity, their eyes wide open. ||48||  Some men and women, filled with immense
joy, were gazing at Rama with the same intensity as the gods gaze at Indra.
||49||  Some, standing near Rama, saw the bow and arrow, and exclaimed, "Oh!
These two delicate weapons are worthy of him!" ||50||  Some praised Lakshmana,
the destroyer of enemies. Some praised Shatrughna. Some praised the beautiful
Janaka's daughter. Some praised Hanuman, the lord of Kishkindha. Some praised
Vibhishana. Some praised Viradha. Some praised Sugriva. ||51-52||  Some, with
minds filled with wonder, were gazing at Janaka's daughter. It was as if she was
the dwelling place of their eyes, which were constantly wandering. ||53||  Then,
approaching Sita, whose heart was filled with anxiety, and seeing Rama, she
thought, "The ocean of separation has finally come to an end." ||54||  When Sita
arrived, Lakshmana offered her water. The kings, standing near Rama, were
overwhelmed with joy and bowed to her. ||55||  Then, seeing Sita approaching
with great speed, Rama, though invincible, felt his heart tremble. ||56||  He
thought, "I had left her in the forest, filled with ferocious beasts. How could
she, who stole my eyes, come back here?" ||57||  "Oh! How shameless she is! How
powerful she is! Even after being banished, she does not give up her
attachment." ||58||  Then, understanding Rama's gesture, Sita, with a heart
filled with despair, thought, "My separation from him has not ended." ||59||

In the Padma Purana,  The heart of the one who is separated from his beloved has
become like a ship that has reached the shore of the ocean of separation. It is
certain that it will be destroyed.  She was filled with anxiety. [6] Bewildered
about what to do, Sita, with her toe, scratched the ground, standing near
Balarama. [6] The daughter of Janaka, standing before him, shone like Lakshmi in
the city of Indra. [2] Then Rama said to Sita, "Why are you standing in front?
Move away, I am not able to look at you." [63] My eyes are able to bear the
midday sun's brilliance or the crest of the serpent's gem, but not to look at
you. [64] You were confined in the palace of Dasha-asya for many months, and yet
I brought you back. What was all this for me? [65] Then Vaidehi said, "There is
no one more cruel than you. You are rejecting me like a common man rejects a
good education." [66] You, with your crooked mind, took me to the forest under
the pretext of Dohada, and left me pregnant. What is this like for you? [67] If
I had attained a bad state there, what would have been achieved by you, the
cause of my misfortune? [68] If there is even a little bit of good feeling or
kindness in you, why didn't you take me to the residence of the peaceful
Aryikas? [69] This Jina-shaasana is the ultimate refuge for the orphans, the
friendless, the poor, and the extremely sorrowful. [70] Even though this has
happened, O Padma-abha, be pleased. What is there to say? Give me your command.
Saying this, she cried in sorrow. [71] Rama said, "O Devi, I know your blameless
character, your devotion to your husband, and the purity of your intentions. But
since you have been subjected to this public slander, convince these people who
are naturally crooked-minded." [73]

Chapter One Hundred and Four 275 Thus spoke the daughter of Janaka, filled with
joy. And I, too, declare this truth to the world with five divine oaths. ||7|| O
Lord, I can drink the Kalakuta, the most potent poison among all poisons, the
very smell of which instantly reduces the Ashvi poison serpent to ashes. ||7|| I
can ascend the balance, or enter the fierce flames of fire, or I can take any
oath that you desire. ||76|| After a moment's thought, Padmaabha said, "Let her
enter the fire." And the great, ever-joyful Sita said, "I will enter." ||77||
"She has accepted death," lamented Narada. The kings of the Sri Saila,
overwhelmed with grief, were distressed. ||7|| Knowing that their mother wished
to enter the fire, Lavana and Angusha, with great wisdom, decided in their
minds, "We too will enter the fire." ||7|| Then, filled with great power and
immense joy, Siddhartha Ksullaka, raising his arm, said, "Even the gods cannot
fully describe the virtue of Sita, what then of lowly beings like us?" ||80-81||
O Rama, Mount Meru can enter the netherworld, and the oceans can dry up, but
there can be no wavering in Sita's virtue. ||81|| The moon can become the sun,
and the sun can become the moon, but Sita's accusation can never attain truth.
||82-83|| I am rich in knowledge and power, and I have worshipped the Jina
images in the eternal, unmade shrines on the five peaks of Mount Meru. O Rama, I
declare with certainty that if there is even a slight flaw in Sita's virtue,
then my rare worship will be rendered fruitless. ||84-85|| I have performed
austerities for thousands of years, wearing only a loincloth. I swear by that
austerity, I declare with the oath of my austerity, that these are indeed your
sons. ||86|| Therefore, O wise Rama, do not let Sita enter that fire, which is
filled with terrifying waves of flames and which destroys all.  1. Rityudiryata

In the Padma Purana, The Vyogn Vaidyaras, the celestial beings, and the earth-
dwellers, the Dharani Charas, exclaimed, "Well said, well said!" with a loud
voice, as if liberated from a great burden. ||8|| "Be pleased, O God, be
pleased, attain tranquility. O Lord! O Rama! O Rama! Do not entertain thoughts
of fire in your mind." ||8|| "Sita is virtuous, Sita is virtuous, there is no
other possibility. The wives of great men do not become corrupted." ||10|| Thus,
the words, choked with tears, spread out from the agitated sea of people,
encompassing all directions. ||11|| Large drops of tears fell from the deeply
sorrowful beings, accompanied by a great roar. ||12|| Padma said, "If you are so
inclined to show mercy, then why did you speak against her earlier?" ||13||
Thus, as if giving orders, Rama, who had fixed his mind on purity, relying on
his supreme strength, commanded his servants, ||14|| "Dig two pits here, deep
and three hundred cubits wide, square in shape. Then, fill them with dry, thick
fuel of black agarwood and sandalwood, and make a fire that burns fiercely and
quickly, a fire that appears like death itself, without delay." ||15-17|| Having
said, "As you are commanded," the servants, with large axes in their hands, who
were even more efficient than the servants of Yama, carried out all the tasks.
||18|| At the same time when Rama and Sita were having this conversation, and
the servants were carrying out the terrifying task of setting fire, in the night
that followed, the Muni Raja, adorned with all ornaments, was meditating in the
Mahendrodya garden. Due to a previous enmity, a Rakshasi named Vidyudvaktra
inflicted a great calamity upon him. ||66-101|| Then, King Shrenik asked the
Muni Punagava, the Gautama Swami,  1. Gadgada Jan - M.  2. This verse is not
present in the M. book.

Chapter One Hundred and Four  In the northern range of the Vijayadhapa mountain,
in the city of Gunja, which was adorned everywhere, there lived a king named
Singhavikram. His queen was named Shri, and they had a son named Sakalabhusan.
Sakalabhusan had eight hundred wives, of whom Kiranmandala was the chief.
Kiranmandala, who possessed a pure heart, once, at the instigation of her co-
wives, drew a picture of her maternal uncle's son, Hemashikha, in a romantic
scene. Seeing this, the king was instantly filled with extreme anger. However,
at the urging of his other wives, he regained his composure.  One night, the
virtuous Kiranmandala was sleeping with her husband. In her sleep, she
repeatedly uttered the name of Hemarath, due to a lapse in her mindfulness.
Hearing this, the king was extremely enraged and, in his anger, renounced the
world. Kiranmandala, on the other hand, became a saintly woman and, after death,
became a Rakshasi named Vidyudvaktara.  When Sakalabhusan, now a monk, was
wandering for alms, the wicked Rakshasi, filled with anger, would constantly try
to harm him. Sometimes she would break the bonds of a wild elephant, sometimes
she would set fire to his house, sometimes she would cause a rain of dust,
sometimes she would appear before him as a horse or a bull, and sometimes she
would cover the path with thorns.  Once, while the monk was seated in a state of
meditation, she broke into his house, brought him before the image of a deity,
and seized him, claiming he was a thief. A crowd of people gathered, shouting
and trying to capture him. Some, who were indifferent to the truth, scorned him
and then released him.  Another time, when he was going out after taking his
meal, the woman who had served him tied a necklace around his neck and declared
him a thief.  Thus, the cruel and wicked Rakshasi, filled with malice,
constantly tormented him with one affliction after another.  Later, the monk was
seated in a state of meditation in the garden called Mahendroyana. The Rakshasi,
driven by her past animosity, inflicted further torment upon him. She would
appear as a Vetala, an elephant, a lion, a snake, or a beautiful woman with
various qualities, all with the intention of harming him.   When asked about the
connection between these afflictions and the monk's past, the Lord Ganadhara
said, "O King, listen!"

led by Sunashi. || 118 || With elephants, lions, horses, camels, donkeys, large
tigers, eight-legged creatures, Samaras, birds, airplanes, chariots, bulls, and
other beautiful vehicles, they covered the sky and all came towards Ayodhya.
Their hair, clothes, and banners were fluttering in the wind, and their crowns,
earrings, and necklaces shone brightly in the sky. || 118-121 || The gods,
surrounded by groups of Apsaras, descended happily, looking down at the earth.
|| 122 || Seeing Sita's story, the god named Meshaketu said to Indra, "O Indra,
look at this very difficult task." || 123 || "O Lord, this Sita is being
afflicted by something that even the gods find difficult to touch and which
causes great fear. How is this happening to her?" || 124 || "How can this
affliction come upon this Shravaka, who is virtuous and has a very pure heart?"
|| 125 || Then Akhandala said, "I am going to worship the all-adorned Kevali.
You do whatever is necessary here." || 126 || Saying this, Indra went towards
the Mahendrodya garden, and Meshaketu went to Sita's place. || 127 || There, in
the sky, he stood on the top of his airplane, shining brightly in all
directions, like the peak of Mount Meru. || 128 || The Arya-Giti Chanda says,
"The sun-like, radiant Meshaketu, standing on the top of his airplane, saw Rama,
who was pleasing to all." || 126 || Thus ends the 104th chapter of the Padma
Purana, narrated by the Acharya Sri Ravishena, which describes the arrival of
the gods at the Kevala-Jnana festival of the all-adorned Kevali. || 104 || 1.
The text "samudyotayate disham" is not found in this book. It is not found in
other books either. 2. The previous four books do not have the 126th verse.

Chapter One Hundred and Five. Seeing the pond filled with dry wood and grass,
Rama, the moon of the Kakutstha dynasty, became troubled in mind.  ||1||  How
can I see this beloved again, who is a collection of virtues, endowed with great
beauty, and adorned with grace and character? ||2||  This beloved, with a body
as delicate as a garland of blooming jasmine, will surely be destroyed by the
mere touch of fire. ||3||  If she had not been born in the lineage of King
Janaka, she would not have faced this public disgrace and death in the fire.
||4||  How can I find happiness, even for a moment, without her? It is better to
live in the forest with her than to be in heaven without her. ||5||  Even though
she is of great and unwavering heart, she is determined to die.  She is entering
the fire with determination, and it is shameful to try to stop her in front of
everyone. ||6||  Even this insignificant Siddhartha, who makes a great noise, is
silent. What excuse can I give to stop this? ||7||  Or, whoever has earned a
particular kind of death, will inevitably meet that death. Who can stop the
darkness that is destined to come? ||8||  When this devoted wife was being
carried away over the salt sea, why didn't Ravana, enraged by the thought "She
doesn't want me," cut off her head with his sword? This would have spared her
from this unbearable doubt. ||9-10||  Death is preferable to unbearable
separation, for separation is a most despicable thing, destroying both hearing
and memory. ||11||  Separation brings sorrow to the heart for as long as one
lives, and the desire for stories and memories related to the departed is
instantly extinguished upon hearing the news of their death. ||12||  Thus, while
Rama was consumed with worry, the fire was lit in the pond. The compassionate
women began to weep. ||13||

280 Padmapurana Then the sky, darkened by smoke, became filled with dense
clouds. It seemed as if the rainy season had arrived untimely and enveloped
everything. ||14|| The world then seemed to be filled with bees, or perhaps with
cuckoos, or perhaps with pigeons. It was a different world altogether. ||15||
Unable to bear the sight of such a calamity, the compassionate Sun quickly hid
himself somewhere. ||16|| In that pond, a terrible fire blazed, its great force
spreading in all directions, with flames as long as chariots. ||17|| Seeing that
fire, one wondered: Is the sky being covered by thousands of suns rising
simultaneously? Or has a multitude of Palasa trees from the netherworld suddenly
risen up? Or has the sky been enveloped by the twilight of the end of the world?
Or is this entire world preparing to become golden? Or is the entire world
becoming filled with lightning? Or has another moving Mount Meru been born out
of a desire to conquer? ||18-20|| Then Sita, whose mind was extremely steadfast,
rose up and, for a moment, renounced her body. She praised the Jinas, who had
been attained through devotion, and bowed to the Tirthankaras, beginning with
Rishabha. She bowed to the Siddhas, all the Sadhus, and the Muni Suvrata Jina,
whose Tirtha was then being served by the gods, demons, and humans, who were
filled with joy and possessed supreme power. With her mind fixed on the feet of
the Acharya, who was dedicated to the welfare of all beings, Sita, who was
noble, profound, and extremely humble, spoke. ||21-24|| "I have not cherished
any other man in my mind, speech, or action, not even in a dream. This is my
truth." ||25|| "If I am speaking falsely, then may this fire, even though it is
far away, reduce me to ashes in an instant." ||26|| "And if I have not cherished
any other man in my mind, even for a moment, then may this fire, which is filled
with purity, not touch me." ||27||

## Chapter 55  **28.** "If I am a false believer, a sinner, a petty one, and an
adulteress, then this fire will burn me. But if I am a virtuous woman, abiding
by my vows, then it will not be able to touch me."   **29.** Having said this,
the goddess entered the fire. But, surprisingly, the fire transformed into
crystal-clear, pleasant, and cool water.  **30.** As if the earth had suddenly
burst open, the water surged forth, filling the pond to the brim and creating
waves.  **31.** There was no fuel, no wood, no embers, no grass, or anything
else that could indicate the presence of fire.  **32.** Powerful whirlpools
formed in the pond, their edges adorned with swirling foam, moving with great
speed, deep and terrifying to behold.  **33.** The sound of a mridanga drum
could be heard in some places, a "gulugul" sound in others, a "bhumbhumbh" sound
elsewhere, and a "patpat" sound in yet another place.  **34.** In some places,
there were roars, in others, long, drawn-out groans, in some, a "dimidi mi"
sound, in others, a "jugud jugud" sound, in some, a "kal kal" sound, in others,
a "shasad bhasad" sound, and in some, a sound like a silver bell.  **35.** The
pond, with its roaring, ocean-like sounds, was churning and tossing, and in an
instant, it began to engulf the people standing on the shore.  **36.** The water
rose to knee-level in an instant, then to hip-level, and then, in the blink of
an eye, it reached breast-level.  **37.** Before the water could reach the
height of a man, the people on earth were terrified, and the celestial beings,
who lived in the sky, were filled with anxiety, wondering what to do.  **38.**
When the water, surging with great force, reached their necks, the people were
overwhelmed with fear and climbed onto the platforms. But soon, even the
platforms began to sink.  **39.** When the water rose above their heads, many
people started to swim. At that time, one of their arms was holding their
clothes and the other was holding their children.  **40.** "Oh, Goddess! Oh,
Saraswati, the giver of wealth, the great benefactor, the protector of dharma,
the well-wisher of all beings, save us!"

282 Padma Purana "Have mercy, O noble one! O Lakshmi! O Saraswati! O great
auspicious one! O one with Dharma! O one who desires the welfare of all beings!
Protect us!"  [41] "Have mercy, O great wife of a husband! O one with a pure
mind like that of a sage!"  Thus, words were uttered from the mouths of people
who were terrified by the water. [42] Then, the bride in the form of the pond,
with hands in the form of waves, touched Rama's two feet, which were as soft as
the center of a lotus and adorned with nails. In an instant, she attained a
gentle state. Her muddy whirlpools became calm, and her terrifying sound ceased.
From this, the people also became happy. [43-44] That pond, in an instant,
became filled with blue lotuses, white lotuses, and ordinary lotuses. It became
beautiful with the music of a swarm of intoxicated bees, buzzing with fragrance.
[45] It was adorned with groups of beautiful-sounding cranes, chakravakas,
swans, and ducks. [46] Its banks became extremely beautiful with steps made of
jewels and gold, situated amidst the waves, and with soft, emerald-colored
flowers. [47] Then, in the middle of that pond, a large, pure, auspicious,
blooming, and extremely soft thousand-petaled lotus appeared. In the middle of
that lotus, a throne was situated, which was covered with various kinds of
jewels, adorned with a garment of the light of jewels, and equal in brilliance
to the moon. [48-49] Then, Sita, who was being comforted by the best of the
divine women with the words "Do not fear," was seated on the throne. At that
time, Sita, who was adorned with an astonishing rise, was as beautiful as
Lakshmi. [50] Groups of gods in the sky, satisfied, released garlands of
flowers, along with the sound "Very good, very good." [51] The beautiful
instrument called Guja resonated, the drums made a loud sound, the Nandis were
overjoyed, the Kahalas made a sweet sound, the groups of conch shells sounded,
the Turyas made a deep sound, the flutes made a clear sound, and the bronze
cymbals made a sweet sound. [52-53] The groups of Vidyadharas, who were eager to
perform the actions of Valgita, Vedita, Udhrishta, and Krusht, danced together,
filled with satisfaction. [54] The daughter of the glorious King Janaka, the
wife of the glorious Balarama, was victorious. [55]

Chapter One Hundred and Five 283 Oh, what a wonder, what a wonder, her character
is so pure. Thus, the two, having reached the sky, stood there. ||56|| Then,
with their hearts filled with genuine love for their mother, Labana and Ankusha,
having crossed the water with great speed, reached Sita. ||57|| Standing on
either side of her, with their love for their mother growing, they comforted
her, smelled her, and bowed their heads in reverence. ||58|| Seeing Sita, whose
body was as pure as a golden rod purified in fire, and whose form was surrounded
by a multitude of brilliant lights, and who resided in a lotus-like home, Rama,
his heart filled with great love, approached her. ||59-60|| And he said, "O
Goddess! Be happy, you are blessed, worshipped by the best of men, your face is
like the full moon of the autumn season, and you are a performer of wondrous
deeds." ||61|| "I will never commit such an offense again, or your sorrow has
passed. O virtuous one! Forgive my fault." ||62|| "You are the supreme goddess
of eight thousand women. You reside on their heads, command them, and exercise
your dominion over me as well." ||63|| "O truthful one! Due to my ignorance, I
have caused you pain out of fear of gossip. ||64|| "My dear! Now, roam freely
with me in this earth, which is bounded by the ocean, along with forests,
groves, and the people of the celestial beings." ||65|| "You, who are worshipped
by the entire world with the utmost respect, enjoy pleasures equal to those of
the gods on your earthly plane." ||66|| "O Goddess! Ascend the Pushpaka chariot,
which is like the rising sun and travels according to desire, and see the summit
of Mount Meru with me, that is, travel everywhere with me." ||67|| "O beloved!
Let us play in those places that captivate your heart, with me, who am obedient
to your word." ||68|| "O noble one! Surrounded by the best women of the
celestial beings, like the celestial women, enjoy your wealth immediately."
||69|| Ralak, with folded hands, was saying, "Victory to the daughter of King
Janaka and victory to the most fortunate wife of Lord Balabhadra, Lord Rama."
||55|| Oh, what a wonder, what a wonder, her character is so pure. ||55-56||

284 Padma Purana Why . Even though I am submerged in the ocean of faults and
devoid of wisdom, I have come to you, O praiseworthy one! Be pleased and abandon
anger. ||70|| Then, Sita said to the king, "O king! I am not angry with anyone.
Why are you so afflicted with sorrow? ||71|| There is no fault of yours or of
any other person in this land. This is the fruit of my own actions, which has
come to fruition. ||72|| O Baldeva! I have enjoyed pleasures like those of the
gods by your grace. Therefore, I do not desire them. Now, I will do that which
will prevent me from being a woman again. ||73|| What is the use of these
pleasures, which are enjoyed by foolish humans, when I am afflicted by these
destructive, painful, and intense pangs of hunger? ||74|| Having traversed
through millions of wombs, I have attained this immense sorrow. Now, I seek the
destruction of sorrows and embrace the Jain initiation. ||75|| Having said this,
with hands like the new shoots of the Ashoka tree, she plucked her own hair and
gave it to Rama, being free from attachment. ||76|| Seeing her hair, which was
as radiant as the Indranila gem, extremely soft, and beautiful, Rama fainted and
fell to the ground. ||77|| While Rama was being revived with sandalwood and
other things, Sita was initiated by the Aryika on the earth. ||78|| Then, by
divine grace, she became free from all obstacles and became a virtuous Shramana,
possessing only clothes as her possessions. ||79|| Her body was purified by the
great ascetics, and she was filled with great fervor. She went to the best
garden, where gods and demons gather. ||80|| When Rama regained consciousness,
due to the wind carrying the scent of pearl garlands, sandalwood paste, and
fans, he looked in that direction, but he did not see Sita. All ten directions
seemed empty to him. Finally, his mind was clouded with sorrow and anger, and he
mounted a great elephant. ||81-82|| At that time, a white umbrella was waving
over his head, a group of chamaras were being waved, and he was surrounded by
many kings. Therefore, the gods... 1. Taavdeekshita M. 2. Dashaanshakah M. 3.

The Uttarashada Parva  "The death of a beloved being is preferable to separation
from him." This was my earlier vow, made with a determined mind. ||85||  If that
is so, why did the gods, in their folly, cause this great distress to Sita,
leading her to undertake this arduous penance? ||86||  O gods! Even though she
has shaved her head, if you do not quickly restore her to me, I will declare you
as non-gods, I will not consider you as gods, and I will make the world into the
sky. ||87||  How can my wife be taken away by the gods who are supposed to
uphold justice? Let them stand before me and take up arms. Where have they all
gone? ||88||  Thus, Rama, who was engaged in various activities and was being
consoled by Lakshmana, who was well-versed in various strategies, reached the
garden where the gods had gathered. ||89||  Then he saw the Kevalis, the best
among the sages, adorned with all virtues, possessing profound wisdom and
unwavering fortitude, seated on a magnificent throne. ||90||  They radiated a
brilliance surpassing that of blazing fire, possessed supreme powers, and their
bodies consumed the sins of those who sought refuge in them. ||91||  They shone
brightly among the gods with the brilliance of their pure knowledge, resembling
the rising sun, free from the veil of clouds. ||92||  They were beloved by the
moon-like kumudini flowers, or like the spotless moon itself, enveloped in the
radiant aura of their bodies. ||93||  Seeing these great sages, who had just
emerged from their meditation and were worshipped by all gods and demons, Rama
dismounted from his elephant and approached them. ||94||  Then, Rama, the lord
of householders, with a calm mind and devotion, offered his respects to the sage
kings by joining his palms in reverence and circumambulating them. ||95||  The
radiance of the sage kings' bodies eclipsed the brilliance of their crowns, and
their cheeks were adorned with earrings that seemed to shimmer with shame.

286 Padmapurana Those who had embraced the cheeks of the Jina, who had offered
salutations with devotion, and who had joined their hands and touched their
foreheads, such Devendras were seated there, like the human king, in a fitting
manner. ||17|| The gods, adorned with various ornaments, who were of four types,
appeared near the Muni-indra like the rays of the sun. ||18|| Even the king of
kings, Rama, shone brightly, not very far from the Muni, like the Kalpa tree on
the summit of Sumeru. ||16|| Even Lakshmana, the king, adorned with a crown and
earrings, shone brightly near the Muni, like a cloud with lightning near a
mountain. ||10|| Shatrughna, skilled in striking fear into the hearts of great
enemies, shone brightly like the second Kubera, with a beautiful appearance.
||10|| Those two heroes, Lava and Kusha, adorned with the quiver of virtue and
good fortune, and with excellent marks, shone brightly like the sun and the
moon. ||10|| Even though she was devoid of external ornaments, the noble Sita,
adorned only with clothes, shone brightly like the sun itself. ||103|| Then, all
the humans and gods, who were desirous of hearing the Dharma, and who were
adorned with humility, sat down on the earth in a fitting manner. ||104|| The
Muni, Abhay-ninada by name, the chief of the group of disciples, a valiant and
courageous soul, asked the Muni-punga, the best of Munis, to dispel the heat of
doubt. ||105|| Then the Muni-raja spoke those words, which were very extensive,
skillful, pure, revealing the true meaning, enlightening the Munis, and
destroying karma. ||106|| Gautama Swami says, "At that time, the Yogi-raja spoke
a secret to the learned and the great souls, which was as vast as the ocean. O
Shrenika! I am only speaking a single particle of it here." ||107|| That which
was spoken by the supreme Yogi, was a true statement, which was pleasing to
those who had good vision and knowledge, and was desirable for the worthy
beings. ||108|| He said, "This world is like two mridangas, situated in the
midst of infinite space, and is situated below, in the middle, and above."
||109|| Because of this three-fold arrangement, this world is known as Triloka
or diverse. There are seven lands below the Meru mountain. ||110|| 1. Rama is
not very far away.

## The One Hundred and Fifty-Fifth Chapter  **287**  The first of these is the
**Ratnapraba** realm, where, except for its vast expanse, the upper two sections
are inhabited by **Bhavana** and **Vyantara** Devas. Below the **Ratnapraba**
are six more realms: **Sharkara**-praba, **Baluka**-praba, **Pank**-praba,
**Dhuma**-praba, **Tama**-praba, and **Mahatama**-praba, which are all producers
of great fear and are filled with intense suffering and perpetual darkness.
These realms are extremely uneven and difficult to traverse, some being as hot
as molten iron, while others are filled with intense cold. They are covered in a
mixture of fat and blood.  The stench of these realms is a mixture of rotting
dogs, snakes, and humans, a truly foul odor.  A powerful wind blows through
these realms, carrying with it the causes of various forms of suffering.  Beings
who are attached to their senses of taste and touch accumulate karma that makes
them heavy like lumps of iron, causing them to fall into these hells.  Those who
do not refrain from violence, falsehood, theft, adultery, and attachment are
born in these hells, burdened by the weight of their sins.  Humans who are
constantly attached to worldly pleasures, driven by their intense karma, fall
into these hells.  Beings who commit sins themselves, cause others to commit
sins, and approve of sins, become prone to anger and sorrow, and are destined
for hell.  Sinners are packed tightly into cells resembling caves, where they
are burned by the fires of hell, emitting terrifying cries.  Driven by the fear
of burning flames, the inhabitants of hell seek refuge in the **Vaitarani**
river, hoping for cool water, and dive into it, abandoning their bodies.  As
they dive, they are consumed by intense alkali, causing excruciating pain in
their burned bodies. They then flee in terror, like deer, into the
**Asipatravana** forest.  There, they gather, seeking shade, but instead find
themselves torn apart by swords, arrows, discs, and spears.  They are further
tormented by sharp weapons wielded by the trees of hell, which are shaken by a
fierce wind.

## English Translation:  **288** **Padma Purana**  Those whose feet, arms,
shoulders, ears, faces, eyes, and noses are cut off, and whose palates, heads,
bellies, and hearts are torn apart, fall there. ||25||  Some with their legs
stretched upwards are cooked in cauldrons by other powerful Narakas. Others are
crushed by machines, making harsh sounds. ||126||  Some are beaten with maces by
enemies filled with intense anger. They roll on the ground, overwhelmed by
immense pain. ||127||  Tormented by intense thirst, the wretched Narakas,
bewildered, beg for water. But instead of water, they are given melted lead and
copper. ||128||  Seeing that terrible liquid, flowing from the burning embers,
those thirsty Narakas tremble, their minds become confused, and their throats
fill with tears. ||129||  They say, "I am not thirsty, leave me alone, I am
going." But despite their unwillingness, they are forcibly made to drink that
liquid. ||130||  They are thrown to the ground, crying out, and their mouths are
torn open with iron rods. Poison, blood, and copper are forcibly poured into
them. ||131||  That liquid burns their throats, shatters their hearts, and
reaches their stomachs, exiting along with a mass of excrement. ||132||  Later,
when they are filled with remorse, the guardians of the Naraka realm remind
those wretched Narakas of their sins, as described by false scriptures. ||133||
They say, "At that time, you were eloquent and transgressed the Gurus, saying,
'Meat is harmless.' Where is that statement of yours now?" ||134||  "You said,
'Shraddha performed with various types of meat and alcohol is very fruitful.'
Where is that statement of yours now?" ||135||  Saying this, those Narakas,
filled with cruelty, kill them and feed on their own bodies. They perform
extremely wretched acts. ||136||  "The state of kingship is as ephemeral as a
dream." Reminding them of this, those born from them torment them with mockery,
and they cry out in sorrow. ||137||  Gautama Swami says, "O King! Those beings
who commit sins, in the realm of Narakas...  1. Varna-Ma. ||

## Chapter One Hundred and Five  **28**  Therefore, knowing the unbearable fruit
of unrighteousness, those with peaceful hearts, O virtuous ones, serve the
Jina's teachings. ||13||  It has been known that the abode of the Ratnaprabha
realm is the dwelling place of the gods. Besides this, the Devaranya forest, the
ocean, and islands are also suitable places for their residence. ||14||  Earth,
water, fire, air, and plants are the five stationary and one mobile, these six
categories of beings are said to be. ||14||  From the difference of dharma,
adharma, space, time, jiva, and pudgala, the substance is said to be sixfold,
with secrets revealed by the Jinesvara. ||142||  The path of the seven-fold
predication is considered the right path. The entire description of the
substance is the proof, and the method is the means of its establishment.
||143||  In one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed
beings, without any contradiction, the quality of sattva-sattva-nama exists, and
it is accompanied by its opposite, the opposing element. ||144||  They should be
known by the difference of subtle and gross, in relation to the body. They are
also said to be two types, in relation to being sufficient and insufficient.
||145||  The difference of bhavya, abhavya, etc., in the jiva substance is also
mentioned, but all these differences are only in the state of samsara, the
Siddha jivas are said to be free from all these differences. ||146||  The
transformation of the jiva in its knowable and visible nature, by its own power,
is called use. Use is the nature of the jiva, and this use is of two types,
according to the difference of knowledge and perception. ||147||  Knowledge-use
is of eight types, according to the difference of mati-jnana, etc., and
perception-use is of four types, according to the difference of chakshus-
darshan, etc. There are two types of jivas, samsari and mukta, and samsari jivas
are of two types, according to the difference of being conscious and
unconscious. ||148||  Those with plant-like bodies and earth-like bodies, etc.,
are called stationary, the rest are called mobile. Those who are endowed with
the five senses of touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing are called
panchendriya. ||149||  The birth of pot-born, egg-born, and womb-born beings is
said to be from the womb, and the birth of gods and hell-beings is said to be
from uppaada. ||150||  The cause of birth for the rest of the beings is
unconscious birth. Thus, there are different types of births, according to womb,
uppaada, and unconsciousness, all accompanied by great suffering. ||151||  Even
for a moment, without taking rest, they suffer the pain described above. ||138||
Therefore, O holder of peaceful hearts, O virtuous ones, knowing that "this is
the unbearable fruit of unrighteousness," serve the Jina's teachings. ||136||

## The Padma Purana: A Translation  **Chapter 151-164**  There are three types
of births, but they are all accompanied by intense suffering.  **Chapter 152**
There are five bodies: Audārika, Vaikriyika, Āhārika, Taijasa, and Kārmaṇa.
These bodies are progressively more subtle.  **Chapter 153**  The Audārika,
Vaikriyika, and Āhārika bodies are infinitely multiplied in terms of their
regions. The Taijasa and Kārmaṇa bodies are infinitely multiplied in terms of
their qualities. The Taijasa and Kārmaṇa bodies are eternally connected to the
soul, meaning they have been with the soul since the beginning of time.  It is
possible for a soul to have up to four of these five bodies simultaneously.
**Chapter 154**  In the Middle World, there are countless islands, starting with
Jambudvipa, and countless oceans, starting with the Salt Ocean. All of these are
called auspicious.  **Chapter 155**  These islands and oceans are twice the size
of the previous ones, and they surround each other in a ring-like shape.
Jambudvipa is located in the center.  **Chapter 156**  Jambudvipa is circular,
with Mount Meru as its navel. It is one hundred thousand yojanas in diameter,
and its circumference is three times that, plus a little more.  **Chapter
157-158**  There are six mountain ranges in Jambudvipa, stretching from east to
west: Himavan, Mahahimavan, Nishadha, Nila, Rukmi, and Shikhari. All of these
are connected to the ocean water, and they divide the regions of Jambudvipa.
**Chapter 159-160**  The region of Bharat is followed by Himavat, then Hari,
then Videha, then Ramyak, then Hairanyavat, and finally Airavat. These seven
regions are all located in Jambudvipa. There are also fourteen rivers in
Jambudvipa, including the Ganga and the Sindhu. The description of Jambudvipa in
the Dhataki Khanda and the Pushkarardha is twice as detailed.  **Chapter 161**
Humans and those who live on the Manushottara mountain live on the same side of
the mountain. There are two main categories of humans: Aryas and Mlechchas.
There are countless subcategories within these two categories.  **Chapter 162**
The regions of Videha, Bharat, and Airavat are the realms of karma. The regions
of Devakuru, Uttarakuru, and other regions are the realms of enjoyment.
**Chapter 163**  The highest state of existence for humans is three palya, and
the lowest is antarmukhurta. The highest and lowest states of existence for
animals are the same as those of humans: three palya and antarmukhurta.
**Chapter 164**  There are eight types of Vyantara Devas, including Kinnaras.
Their places of play are described accordingly.  **Note:** The term "Jambudvipa"
is a Jain term referring to the central continent of the Jain cosmology. The
term "yojana" is a unit of measurement used in ancient India.

## Chapter One Hundred and Five  **The Bright Circle of the Vyantara and
Jyotisha Devas**  The Vyantara and Jyotisha Devas reside in the upper middle
realm. The circle of the Jyotisha Devas is radiant and luminous, constantly
circling Mount Meru, with the Sun and Moon as its kings. ||165||  **The Maha-
Loka of the Kalpavasis**  Above the circle of the Jyotisha Devas, after
traversing countless thousands of yojanas, lies the Maha-Loka, the abode of the
Kalpavasis. ||166||  **The Sixteen Heavens of the Upper Realm**  In the Maha-
Loka, there are sixteen heavens: Saudharma, Aishana, Sanatkumara, Maheindra,
Brahma, Brahmottara, Lantava, Kapishtha, Shukra, Maha-Shukra, Shatara, Sahasrar,
Anata, Pranata, Aran, and Achyuta. These are arranged in eight pairs.
||167-168||  **The Nine Graiveyakas**  Above these sixteen heavens are the nine
Graiveyakas, where the supreme Tri-dasas reside, with Ahmi-Indra as their
leader. ||169-170||  **The Five Anuttara Vimanas**  Beyond the nine Graiveyakas
are the five Anuttara Vimanas: Vijay, Vaijayanta, Jayanta, Aparajita, and
Sarvartha-Siddhi. ||171||  **The Siddha-Kshetra**  Above this entire three-fold
realm lies the Siddha-Kshetra, a realm of extraordinary brilliance and wonder,
the abode of those who have been liberated from the bonds of karma. ||172||
**The Earth of Ishta-Prag-Bhar**  Above the Siddha-Kshetra lies the auspicious
Earth of Ishta-Prag-Bhar, resembling an inverted white umbrella, where the
Siddha-Paramesthis reside, free from rebirth, filled with supreme bliss, and
empowered by their own self-nature. ||173-174||  **The Nature of Bliss**  Rama
asked the Lord, "What is the nature of the bliss experienced by those who are
free from karma, liberated from the cycle of birth and death, and free from
suffering?" ||175||  **The Illusion of Worldly Bliss**  The Kevali Lord replied,
"The so-called bliss of this three-fold realm is merely a form of suffering,
characterized by anxiety, destruction, and impermanence." ||176||  **The Bondage
of Karma**  "Bound by eight types of karma, the worldly being never experiences
even a moment of true happiness." ||177||  **The Obscuring Power of Karma**
"Just as a lump of gold, covered in iron, loses its natural brilliance, so too
does a being, covered in karma, lose its inherent radiance." ||178||  **The
Suffering of Samsara**  "The beings of this world are constantly tormented by
death, birth, old age, disease, and countless mental afflictions. What happiness
is there here?" ||179||  **The False Delights of the Senses**  "The pleasures of
the senses are like the sweetness of honey on a poisoned arrow. They are like
the fragrance of sandalwood mixed with poison." ||180||

##  Chapter 212 of the Padma Purana  **18.** The bliss of the Siddhas is
described as being beyond comparison, free from all suffering, and inherent to
their nature.  **182.** What is the use of sleep for those who have lost their
sleep? What is the use of medicine for the healthy? What is the use of lamps and
the sun for the omniscient and those who have achieved their goals?  **183.**
What is the use of weapons for those who are fearless and free from enemies?
What is the use of striving for those who see everything fulfilled?  **184.**
What is the use of food and drink for those who are content with the supreme
bliss? Even the Indra, the king of the gods, constantly desires the bliss of the
Siddhas.  **185.** Although there is no true comparison for this bliss, I will
speak about it to enlighten you about the bliss of the Siddhas.  **186.** The
bliss enjoyed by the Chakravartis, the Indras, and all the gods, even for an
infinite period, cannot even come close to the bliss of the Siddhas, who are
free from karma.  **187.** The bliss of the Siddhas is incomparable, even to the
bliss of the inhabitants of the infinite universes.  **188.** Kings are happier
than ordinary people, Chakravartis are happier than kings, Vyantara Devas are
happier than Chakravartis, Jyotish Devas are happier than Vyantara Devas.
**189.** Bhavanavasi Devas are happier than Jyotish Devas, Kalpavasis are
happier than Bhavanavasi Devas, Graiveyakavasis are happier than Kalpavasis, and
Anuttaravasis are happier than Graiveyakavasis.  **190.** And the Siddhas, who
are infinitely more blissful than the Anuttaravasis, are the most blissful of
all. There is no bliss greater than the bliss of the Siddhas.  **160.** Infinite
perception, infinite knowledge, infinite power, and infinite bliss - these four
are the inherent nature of the soul, and they exist in the Siddhas.  **161.**
However, these same qualities in worldly beings are different due to the
difference in the cessation of their karma, and they are manifested in various
ways due to external objects.  **162.** The happiness derived from the objects
of the senses, such as sound, is like a wound filled with thorns, caused by the
pain of disease. Therefore, the hope for happiness in the body is a delusion.
**163.** The Siddhas, who are free from coming and going, whose all afflictions
are destroyed, and who are the crown of the world, enjoy incomparable bliss.
**180.** The sweetness of honey is like a wound, the bliss of heaven is like
sandalwood paste on a burnt wound, and the bliss of a Chakravarti is like food
mixed with poison.  **181.** But the bliss of the Siddha Bhagavans is eternal,
supreme, free from suffering, incomparable, and born of the nature of the soul.
**Note:** This translation preserves the Jain terms "Siddha," "Chakravarti,"
"Vyantara Deva," "Jyotish Deva," "Bhavanavasi Deva," "Kalpavasis,"
"Graiveyakavasis," and "Anuttaravasis."

Chapter One Hundred and Five  If their vision and knowledge illuminate the world
and the beyond, they cannot be compared to the sun, which illuminates only the
small things. (13)  The knowledge of a person who is able to know all the parts
of a myrobalan fruit in his hand is not equal to the knowledge of a Siddha. (16)
A Kevali is equal in all states, in all three periods of time. He is endowed
with knowledge and vision, and there is no other like him. (17)  Just as there
is a difference between the knowledge and vision of Siddhas and ordinary beings,
so too there is a difference between their happiness and their strength. (168)
Only a Kevali knows the true nature of the vision, knowledge, and happiness of
Siddhas. The words of others are merely analogies. (16)  This abode of the Jina,
the state of a Siddha, is unattainable by the Abhyavya, even if they strive with
all their might and inflict great pain on their bodies. (200)  For they are
bound by the endless cycle of time and are constantly embraced by the ignorance
that is their companion, never leaving them. (201)  Those who are eager to
embrace the woman of liberation, the Bhavyas, spend their days in austerity,
enduring great hardship. (202)  Those who are devoid of the power of liberation
are called Abhyavya, while those who will attain liberation are called Bhavyas.
(203)  The Kevali, the All-Embellished, says, "O Raghunandan, even with all
effort, there is no destruction of karma in any other path than the path of the
Jina." (204)  The ignorant being destroys karma over countless lifetimes, while
the knower destroys it in a single moment with the three secrets. (205)  This is
known throughout the world: the true nature of the Nir-anjan, the spotless
Supreme Being, is seen only by those whose karma is destroyed. (206)  Many have
grasped the path of the world, which is devoid of essence. To attain the
ultimate truth, embrace the path of the Jina. (207)  Thus, hearing the words of
the All-Embellished, Sri Rama bowed and said, "O Lord, save us from this ocean
of existence." (208)

In the Padma Purana, It is asked: "How are the noble beings, who are of three
types - inferior, mediocre, and superior - liberated from the cycle of birth and
death?" || 206 || The Lord, the embodiment of right faith, knowledge, and
conduct, said: "The path to liberation is described in the Jain scriptures as
the unity of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct." || 210 || "Faith
in the principles is called right faith. The principle, which is the essence of
all, is of two types: conscious and unconscious, and has infinite qualities and
permutations." || 211 || "One who, through the door of natural understanding,
accepts the principle with devotion, is called a right-seeing being, devoted to
the Jain faith." || 212 || "Doubt, desire, uncertainty, praise of other
doctrines, and criticizing noble people by pointing out their faults are the
five transgressions of right faith." || 213 || "Stability, delight in the abode
of the Jinas, noble thoughts, and freedom from doubt and other faults are the
means of purifying right faith." || 214 || "Conduct that is performed with right
knowledge, according to the principles laid down by the omniscient, by a person
who has conquered his senses, is called right conduct." || 215 || "Right conduct
is that which is free from sin, where the senses are controlled, and speech and
mind are restrained." || 216 || "Right conduct is that which involves non-
violence towards all living beings, both mobile and immobile, in accordance with
the principles of justice." || 217 || "Right conduct is that which involves
speaking words that are pleasing to the mind and ears, affectionate, sweet,
meaningful, and beneficial." || 218 || "Right conduct is that which involves
refraining from taking what is not given, in thought, word, and deed, and
accepting only what is rightfully given." || 219 || "Right conduct is that which
involves observing celibacy, which is revered even by the gods and difficult to
maintain even for great men." || 220 || "Right conduct is that which involves
renouncing possessions, with the abandonment of fainting spells, which are great
obstacles on the path to liberation." || 221 || "Right conduct is that which
involves giving charity to those who have renounced the world, which is free
from harming others and is accompanied by faith and other virtues." || 222 ||

**Chapter One Hundred and Five**  **Right Conduct**  **223.**  Vಿನಯ, ನಿಯಮ, ಶೀಲ,
ಜ್ಞಾನ, ದಯ, ದಮ, and meditation for liberation, when these are present, it is
called Right Conduct.  **224.**  This Right Conduct, endowed with these
qualities, as spoken by the Jinas, is to be followed for the attainment of
liberation, the highest good.  **225.**  A being with Right Faith can do what is
possible, and refrains from what is impossible. A being with Right Faith and
Right Knowledge is capable of following Right Conduct.  **226.**  Where these
great qualities are not present, there is no Right Conduct, and no escape from
the cycle of birth and death.  **227.**  Where there is no compassion, self-
control, or forgiveness, there is no restraint, no knowledge, no renunciation,
and no religion.  **228.**  Where violence, falsehood, theft, lust, and
attachment are practiced in the name of religion, there is no religion.
**229.**  One who, after taking initiation, indulges in sin with a foolish mind,
has neither Right Conduct nor liberation.  **230.**  Where the suffering of the
six categories of living beings is inflicted for the sake of pleasure under the
guise of religion, liberation is not attained.  **231.**  What is the initiation
of one who is attached to villages, fields, etc., and who engages in killing,
beating, binding, torturing, and exploiting?  **232.**  What liberation can a
wicked, initiated person attain who is attached to buying and selling, cooks his
own food, or begs, and keeps gold and other possessions?  **233.**  Those who,
after initiation, indulge in massage, bathing, rituals, garlands, incense, and
ointments, are not liberated.  **234.**  Those who, out of their own intellect,
declare violence to be free from fault, and who criticize the scriptures, the
way of life, and conduct, are fools.  **235.**  One who stays in a village for
one night, in a city for five nights, keeps his arms raised constantly, eats
once a month, sleeps in the forest with the deer, wanders with them, performs
the Bhrigu-pāt, remains silent, and renounces possessions, is a Kuliṅga,
contaminated by false views.  **236.**  One who is contaminated by false views,
a Kuliṅga, devoid of the seed of liberation, cannot reach the abode of
liberation even by walking.

## The Pabhapurana:  **238.** The foolish soul, clinging to the path of Dharma,
commits sins like entering fire or water, and thus falls into misery, not
understanding his own good.  **239.** The one who is attached to fierce and
sorrowful meditation, who is not victorious over desire, who performs evil
deeds, and whose actions are contrary to the right path, will experience a
condemned fate.  **240.** Even if one with a false view gives charity to the
virtuous and the wicked, guided by the Dharma, he binds himself to the karma
that brings great prosperity.  **241.** Even though such a being enjoys the
fruits of his Dharma in heaven, it is not even a fraction of the reward that
comes with attaining Right Faith.  **242.** Those who possess the exalted Right
Faith and are devoted to good conduct are praised in this world and become
prominent in the heavenly realms after death.  **243.** Even with great effort,
the one with a false view, a Kuliṅga, becomes a servant of the gods and receives
only a meager reward.  **244.** The one with Right Faith, having enjoyed the
pleasures of being a human and a god in seven or eight lifetimes, attains
liberation by embracing the life of a monk.  **245.** The one who is deluded by
worldly objects does not desire to follow the path shown by the liberated, the
all-knowing.  **246.** Bound by the strong chains of desire, deeply engrossed in
delusion, they are brought into the house of thirst, carrying the chains of sin.
**247.** Various beings, clinging to the pleasures and pains of taste and touch,
suffer greatly, having abandoned their refuge.  **248.** "He fears death, but
does not attain liberation. He constantly desires happiness, but does not
achieve it."  **249.** Thus, controlled by futile fear and desire, this being,
devoid of any means, only experiences suffering.  **250.** Always consumed by
desire, he seeks to enjoy pleasures, but does not perform any Dharma, just like
a mosquito does not care for gold.

Chapter One Hundred and Five 217 Tormented by the fire of afflictions, this
being is eager to begin many actions. He does not attain any purpose, and even
the happiness he has is lost. ||25|| This being, due to past sins, does not
attain the desired object of his mind. Instead, he attains great and
insurmountable misfortune. ||252|| "I have done this, I am doing this, and I
will do this." Thus, a man resolves, but never considers that he will die.
||253|| Death does not wait to see what a being has done or not done. It attacks
at an inopportune time, just as a lion attacks a deer. ||254|| Alas! The deluded
beings consider the harmful as beneficial, suffering as happiness, the
impermanent as permanent, the fearful as refuge, the beneficial as harmful,
happiness as suffering, the protector as the destroyer, and the stable as
unstable. It has to be said that the conduct of the deluded beings is different.
||255-256|| This man, like a wild elephant, is bound by the fetters of his wife,
or like a fish, is attached to the bait of worldly objects, and thus experiences
bondage. ||257|| Stuck in the vast ocean of delusion, filled with the mud of
family, this being, like a weak ox, struggles and suffers. ||258|| A bound man
can be freed from a blind well, but a being bound by the fetters of attachment
is freed with great difficulty. ||259|| The knowledge of the Jina, which is very
rare even in the human world, is not attainable by an abhyavi. Similarly, the
path of the three jewels, as taught by the Jina, is not attainable by an
abhyavi. ||260|| Marked by the stain of heavy karmas, the abhyavi beings are
constantly riding the wheel of samsara, carrying the burden of afflictions.
||261|| Then, folding his hands and bowing his head, Rama said, "O Bhagavan! Am
I a bhavi? And by what means will I be liberated?" ||262|| "I am capable of
abandoning this earth, along with my inner palace, but I am not capable of
abandoning even a single act of kindness done by Lakshmana." ||263|| I am like a
ship, adrift in the waves of attachment, clinging to the fragments of worldly
objects. O Muniśvara, grant me the support of your grace. ||264|| This being
does not possess patience in the Dharma. ||250||

In the Padma Purana, The Lord said, "O Rama, you should not grieve. You are
destined to enjoy the wealth of Baldeva. Just as Indra obtains the royal fortune
of heaven, so too, by obtaining the royal fortune here, you will ultimately
receive the initiation of Jinesvara and attain the state of liberation, which is
full of knowledge. " Hearing the words of the Kevali, Rama, whose hair stood on
end with great joy, whose eyes were wide open, who was handsome and whose face
was radiant, became filled with fortitude, happiness, and contentment. Gautama
Swami says that all the gods, demons, and humans there were astonished and
amazed to know that Rama was a final body. With great joy, they praised the
truth revealed by the sun-like Kevali. Thus ends the one hundred and fifth
chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the Arsha, narrated by the Acharya
Ravishena, which describes the hearing of Rama's Dharma.

1.  One hundred and six chapters, Vrishabha, the ornament of the celestial
beings, Vibhishana, adorned with devotion to him.  The great ornament of the
fearless, Vrishabha, the garment of the sky dwellers. 2.  He, with his hands
like great lotuses, the best of those who bear a body, having bowed down, asked
the wise one, adorned with all ornaments. 3.  O Lord, what good deed did this
Rama do in a previous birth, by which he has attained such greatness? 4.  His
wife, the virtuous Sita, who was living in the Dandaka forest, was abducted by
Ravana due to what karmic fault? 5.  Ravana knew all the scriptures concerning
dharma, artha, kama, and moksha, he knew the distinction between right and
wrong, and was wise in matters of dharma and adharma. 6.  Though endowed with
excellent qualities, he, being under the sway of delusion, became like a moth,
attracted to the fire of lust for another's wife. 7.  How did Lakshmana, who was
extremely devoted to his brother, and who was wandering in the forest, kill him
in battle? 8.  Ravana, who was so powerful, the king of the Vidyadharas, and who
had performed many wonders, how did he come to such a death? 9.  Then the voice
of the Kevali, the knower of all, spoke, saying that in this world, Rama and
Lakshmana had a deep-seated enmity with Ravana for many births. 10.  In this
Jambudvipa, in the Bharat Kshetra, there was a city called Kshetra, where there
lived a merchant named Nayadatta, who was a man of ordinary wealth. 11.  He had
a son named Dhanadatta, born of his wife Sunanda, who was the soul of Rama.  His
second son was named Vasudatta, who was the soul of Lakshmana.  A Brahmin named
Yajnavalli was a friend of Vasudeva, and he was the soul of you, Vibhishana. 12.
In the same city, there lived another merchant named Sagardatta.  His wife's
name was Ratnapraba, and they had a daughter named Gunavati, who was the soul of
Sita. 13.  She, Gunavati, was endowed with beauty, youth, grace, radiance, and a
charming demeanor.  She had a younger brother named Gunavan, who had a beautiful
mind.

Padma Purana  Knowing that the bow was made by Pinaka, the one who desired the
family, the mature maiden was given by the learned Dhanadata to the prosperous
one. [14]  The other wealthy merchant's son, known as Shrikanta, constantly
desired her. [15]  Considering the scarcity of wealth, the mother with a petty
mind disregarded Dhanadata and desired to give the maiden to Shrikanta. [16]
Knowing this scheme, Vasudatta, the beloved elder brother, attempted to kill
Shrikanta under the pretext of a sacrifice. [17]  Gathering the circles, in the
deep darkness of the night, he silently placed his steps, covered in a blue
garment. [18]  Going to the garden of the house, he found Shrikanta in a
careless state and struck him with the sword, and Shrikanta was killed by him.
[19]  Thus, they both met death by mutual killing and were born as deer in the
great forest of Vindhya. [20]  The maiden was then prevented by the evil people
from being given to Dhanadata. They indeed get angry without any reason, what to
say of advice? [21]  Due to the death of the brother and the non-attainment of
the maiden, Dhanadata, distressed, wandered in various countries from his home.
[22]  The maiden, also extremely unhappy as she did not get the desired one, was
engaged in the undesirable task of serving food in the house. [23]  Due to her
false belief nature, she always hated the unclothed (ascetics), was jealous of
them, abused them, and also disrespected them. [24]  Being attached to false
beliefs, she had no faith in the Jain doctrine at all, according to the bondage
of karma. [25]  Then, at the end of her life, being devoted to painful
meditation, she was born as a doe in the same forest where they (Shrikanta and
Vasudatta) resided as deer. [26]  Due to the defect of previous connection, she
again became a deer along with them, and after killing each other, they went to
the state of a boar. [27]

## Chapter One Hundred and Six  Two [beings] were born as boars, then as
buffaloes, cows, monkeys, leopards, wolves, and blackbucks. They killed each
other in all these forms. ||28||  They were always eager to follow their hatred,
whether in water or on land. They were always killing each other in this way,
being engaged in evil deeds. ||29||  Then, Dhanadatta, exhausted from the
journey and deeply distressed, reached the hermitage of the monks one day when
the sun had set. ||30||  Thirsty, he said to the monks, "I am very distressed,
please give me water. You are fond of doing good deeds." ||31||  One of the
monks, comforting him with sweet words, said, "Even nectar is not proper to
drink at night, let alone water." ||32||  "My dear, do not eat when the eyes
cease their function, which is a time of great evil, filled with unseen, subtle
beings, and when the sun is absent." ||33||  "O Blessed one, even when you are
distressed, you should not eat at an inappropriate time. Do not fall into the
ocean of the world, filled with the bitter water of suffering." ||34||  Then,
calmed by the stories of the monks' virtues, he became a follower of the
Anuvrata, his mind filled with compassion. He was not able to become a follower
of the Mahavratas because he was of limited strength. ||35||  When his time
came, he died and attained the heaven of Saudharma, adorned with a crown,
earrings, bracelets, garlands, and a signet ring, a glorious god. ||36||  There,
due to the merit of his past deeds, he was delighted by the pleasures of the
celestial nymphs, surrounded by a large family of Apsaras, and enjoyed himself
like Indra. ||37||  Then, he was born in the great city of Mahapur, as the son
of a wealthy Jain merchant named Meru, and his mother was Dharini. ||38||  In
the same city, there was a king named Chhatracchaya. His queen was named
Shridatta, who was a treasure trove of queenly virtues. ||39||  One day,
Padmaruchi was riding on horseback, returning to his Gokul, when he saw a worn-
out bull lying on the ground. ||40||  **Notes:**  * **Anuvrata:** A set of
lesser vows in Jainism. * **Mahavratas:** The five great vows in Jainism. *
**Saudharma:** One of the higher heavens in Jain cosmology. * **Apsaras:**
Celestial nymphs in Hindu and Buddhist mythology. * **Indra:** The king of the
gods in Hindu mythology. * **Gokul:** A village in Hindu mythology, associated
with the childhood of Krishna.

In the Padma Purana,  Padmaruchi, adorned with fragrant garments and garlands,
dismounted from his horse and approached the ox with compassion and respect.
||41||  As he chanted the Panchanamaskara mantra into the ox's ear, the ox's
soul departed from its body, having heard the mantra. ||42||  Due to the
influence of the mantra, Padmaruchi was born as the son of Queen Shridatta, the
wife of King Chatrachchhaya, whose karma-jāl (web of karma) had lessened.
Chatrachchhaya was overjoyed at the birth of his son, as he had no children
before. ||43||  The city was adorned with great splendor, and a grand festival
was held with music and festivities. ||44||  Then, due to the influence of his
past karma, Padmaruchi remembered his previous birth as an ox. He recalled the
unbearable suffering he had endured carrying burdens, enduring heat and cold,
and the pain of his feet. He also remembered the opportunity he had received to
hear the Panchanamaskara mantra. Despite being engrossed in childhood games, he
always kept the memory of hearing the mantra in his mind. ||45-46||  One day,
while wandering, he reached the place where the ox had died. He recognized each
place he had visited in his previous life. ||47||  Then, the prince, named
Vrishabhadhwaja, dismounted from his elephant and, with a heavy heart, gazed at
the place where the ox had died for a long time. ||48||  When he could not see
the wise Padmaruchi, the giver of the jewel of Samadhi-death and the one with
excellent deeds, he pondered how to find him. ||49||  Then, he built a Jain
temple on that very spot, resembling the peak of Mount Kailasa. He had the
stories of the great men and the Puranas inscribed on tablets and paintings
within the temple. ||50||  At the entrance of the temple, he had a painting
depicting his previous birth, and he stationed clever men near it to test
people. ||51||  Then, with a desire to pay homage, Padmaruchi went to the temple
one day and...

Chapter Sixty-Six  53. As he gazed at the picture, the servants of Vrishadhvaja
informed him of the conversation.   54. Then, the prince, endowed with great
wealth, mounted his excellent elephant and came there, desiring to meet the
sage.  55. Dismounting from the elephant, he entered the Jina temple and saw
Dharinisuta Padmaruchi, who was intently gazing at the picture.  56. Recognizing
Padmaruchi, whose eyes, face, and hands expressed great wonder, Vrishadhvaja
bowed at his feet.  57. Padmaruchi told him of the bull's sorrowful death, and
the prince, with tearful eyes, said, "That bull was I."  58. As a good disciple
rejoices in honoring his teacher, so Vrishadhvaja, the prince, quickly honored
Padmaruchi and was pleased.  59. After the honor, the prince said to Padmaruchi,
"At that time, when I was surrounded by the danger of death, you came to me like
a dear friend and enabled me to attain Samadhi."  60. "You, compassionate one,
gave me the support of Samadhi, the nectar of liberation. See, I have attained
this existence, satisfied by that."  61. "Neither my mother, nor my father, nor
my brother, nor my relatives, nor the gods have done for me what you have done."
62. "Though I do not see the value of the gift of the five prostrations and the
hearing of the scriptures, yet my supreme devotion to you compels me to do
this."  63. "O Lord, command me, tell me what I should do for you. O Supreme
Being, by giving me a command, grace me, your devotee."  64. "Take this entire
kingdom, I will be your servant. Employ this body in whatever work is
beneficial."  65. Thus, with such excellent words, great love arose between
them. They both attained Samyaktva, the kingdom became theirs jointly, and their
association became eternal.  66. Their affection, not merely superficial, but
reaching to their bones and marrow, made them both followers of the Shravaka
vows. Steadfast in their minds, they both stood firm on the earth, worshipping
the Jina images and the shrines.

##  Padma Purana  **Verse 66:**  He built many Jain temples and images of the
Jinas.  **Verse 67:**  He adorned the earth hundreds of times with stupas
resembling white lotus buds.  **Verse 68:**  After that, at the time of death,
he worshipped the Samadhi and became a god in the Ishana realm, enjoying the
fruits of his virtuous deeds.  **Verse 69:**  The brilliance of his eyes was
like the blossoming lotus of the celestial women, and all his desires were
fulfilled as he played in meditation.  **Verse 70:**  In due time, Padma-ruchi
also attained Samadhi-death and became a beautiful Vimana-deva in the Ishana
heaven.  **Verse 71:**  After that, his soul migrated from there to the
Vijayachala mountain in the western Videha region, and was born as Nayana-
ananda, the son of King Nandi-ishvara of Nandya-varta city, and Queen Kanaka-
bha. There, he enjoyed the immense wealth of the king of the celestial beings
for a long time.  **Verse 72-73:**  Then, he embraced the life of a monk,
performed extremely difficult austerities, and finally attained Samadhi-death,
reaching the Mahendra heaven.  **Verse 74:**  There, he enjoyed the most
beautiful and delightful pleasures through the five senses, which were like the
great fruits of the vine of merit.  **Verse 75:**  After that, he migrated from
there to the city of Kshema, situated in the eastern part of Mount Meru, and was
born as a famous prince named Shri-chandra.  **Verse 76:**  His mother was
Padmavati and his father was Vipula-vahana. There, he enjoyed the remaining
residue of the karma he had accumulated in heaven.  **Verse 77:**  Due to the
influence of his merit, his treasury, kingdom, and military forces were
constantly growing in all directions.  **Verse 78:**  Shri-chandra, who was like
the ruler of a village, ruled over a vast earth with various treasures,
cherishing it like a beloved.  **Verse 79:**  He was nurtured by beautiful women
with charming gestures, and played like Indra, surrounded by celestial women.
**Verse 80:**  Like the Dodunduka deva, he possessed great wealth and power, and
thousands of years passed for him like a moment.  **Verse 81:**  Then, at some
point, he was surrounded by a large and powerful assembly of those who practiced
vows and secrecy, and who were superior in their devotion to the Samadhi.

Chapter One Hundred and Six 3.5 When the people of the city learned that the
Muni was staying in the garden, they all went there with great joy, eager to pay
their respects. ||2|| Hearing the sound of the multitude of devotees, which was
like the roar of a cloud, Sri Chandra listened intently and asked those nearby,
"Whose sound is this, which is like the ocean?" ||3|| Those who were asked by
the king did not know the cause of the sound, so they brought the minister to
the king. ||4|| The king then asked the minister, "Find out whose sound this
is." The minister went, learned the truth, and returned to inform the king.
||85|| Then, with his eyes shining like blooming lotuses, and his body trembling
with joy, the king, along with his wife, set out to pay his respects to the
Muni. ||86|| Seeing the Muni, whose face was like the moon, the king bowed his
head in reverence and sat down on the ground in humility. ||87|| Seeing the
Muni, who was like the sun to the lotus of his mind, the king felt a great love
that was beyond words. ||88|| Then, the Muni, who was deeply learned in all the
scriptures, gave a discourse on the truth to the vast multitude. ||89|| He said
that there are two types of Dharma, the Anāgāra and the Sāgāra, both of which
are full of many different aspects and lead to liberation from the cycle of
birth and death. ||90|| The Muni, who was the best of speakers, explained the
four aspects of the Anuyoginī: 1) Prathamānuyoga, 2) Karaṇānuyoga, 3)
Caraṇānuyoga, and 4) Dravyānuyoga. ||91|| Then, he spoke of the Ākṣepaṇī, which
criticizes other views, and the Nikṣepaṇī, which explains his own truth. Then,
he spoke of the Samvejanī, which inspires fear of the world, and the Nivedanī,
which inspires detachment from worldly pleasures and leads to virtue. ||92-93||
He said that for a being who is running through the cycle of birth and death,
liberation can only be attained through great effort and through the practice of
Karma Yoga. ||94|| 1. Sammadam toṣatatparaḥ M. 2. Tairamā kṛtyato'ntikaḥ V.,

The Padma Purana says:  15. This world is like twilight, bubbles, foam, waves,
lightning, and a rainbow. There is no essence in it.  36. This being experiences
only suffering in hell or the animal realm, and it is not satisfied with the
happiness of humans and gods.  17. How can one who is not satisfied with the
wealth of Indra's pleasures be satisfied with the petty pleasures of humans?
18. Just as a foolish man, having obtained a treasure, becomes careless and
loses it, so too, this being, having obtained the rare human birth, becomes
careless due to the desire for the taste of worldly pleasures and loses its
human birth.  16. What is the satisfaction of fire with dry fuel? What is the
satisfaction of the ocean with river water? And what is the satisfaction of this
embodied being with the pleasures of the taste of worldly objects?  10. Like a
man drowning in water, a clever man, deluded by the bait of worldly objects,
becomes blind to wisdom and falls into foolishness.  10. The sun shines only
during the day, but lust burns day and night. The sun has a covering, but lust
has no covering.  102. In this world, birth, death, old age, and suffering,
arising from continuous karma, are like the wheel of an oil press, and they are
frightening to remember.  103. Just as an inanimate machine is moved by a living
being, so too, this impermanent and foul body is moved by the soul. The
attachment to this body is due to delusion.  10. Knowing that this human birth
is as insubstantial as a water bubble, noble souls become detached and take
refuge in the path revealed by the Jinas.  105. Those who are covered with the
armor of enthusiasm, who ride on the horse of determination, and who wield the
sword of meditation, are the brave and wise who set out for liberation.  106. O
humans! Be certain that the body is separate and I am separate, and give up
attachment to the body and practice Dharma.  107. Those who consider happiness
and suffering to be equal, who see no difference between friends and strangers,
and who are free from attachment and aversion, are the true monks, the best of
men.  10. Their...  1. 'Just as an inanimate machine is moved by a living being,
so too, the body, which is foul and decaying, is moved by the soul. Attachment
to this body is futile, so you should know this as the truth.' - From the
Brihatsvayambu Stotra, in praise of Samantabhadra.

## The Hundredth Chapter of the Parsvanatha Purva  **307**  Hearing the Muni's
words, Shri Chandra, having taken refuge in enlightenment, turned away from the
pleasures of worldly objects. ||10||  Giving his kingdom to his only son, the
great-minded one, he took the vows of a Shraman near Samadhi Gupta Nath. ||11||
United with right faith, he was a yogi, possessing purity, endowed with samitis
and guptis, free from attachment and aversion. ||111||  Adorned with the three
jewels, he was united with virtues like truthfulness, etc., he was full of the
Jain teachings, a Shraman, well-established in meditation. ||112||  He was the
foundation of the five great vows, a protector of beings, free from the seven
fears, endowed with supreme fortitude. ||113||  He was devoted to good conduct,
a bearer of hardships, a Muni, who performed the purificatory fasts of the
sixth, eighth, and other months. ||114||  His mind was absorbed in meditation
and study, he was free from ego, a conqueror of the senses, free from the desire
for future enjoyments, he was supremely peaceful, and a great devotee of the
teachings. ||115||  He was skilled in non-violent conduct, devoted to the
welfare of the monastic order, free from desire even for a single hair of a
child. ||116||  His body was adorned with the dust of his unwashed feet, he was
free from attachment, a Digambara, he stayed for one night in a village and five
nights in a city. ||117||  His abode was in the caves of mountains, on the banks
of rivers, or in beautiful gardens, he had renounced attachment to his body, he
was steadfast, silent, learned, and devoted to right austerities. ||118||
Having thus acquired these virtues, Shri Chandra, having worn out the cage of
karma, attained the time of his liberation and became the lord of the Brahma
world. ||119||  There, in his supreme abode, he was endowed with splendor, fame,
brilliance, and radiance, he was illuminated by the jewel on his head, and
renowned throughout the three worlds. ||120||  Although he sported with the
supreme powers born of meditation, he remained detached, like Indra, the king of
the gods, or like the emperor Bharata. ||121||  In Nandana and other gardens,
the gods of the Saudharma heaven, endowed with great wealth, stood waiting for
him, their minds filled with longing. ||122||  The Munis, with their eyes of
pure meditation, have burnt to ashes the vast forest of karma, filled with wild
animals of suffering. ||108||  Thus, hearing the teachings of the Muni, Shri
Chandra turned away from the pleasures of worldly objects and attained the three
jewels. ||109||  As a result, the generous-hearted one, gave his kingdom to his
son, Dhritikanta, and took the vows of a Muni near Samadhi Gupta Nath. ||110||
Now, Shri Chandra Muni was united with appropriate faith, he possessed the
purity of the three yogas, he was endowed with samitis and guptis, and he was
free from attachment and aversion. ||111||  He was adorned with the three
jewels, he was united with virtues like forgiveness, etc., he was full of the
Jain teachings, a Shraman, and well-established in meditation. ||112||  He was
the foundation of the five great vows, a protector of beings, free from the
seven fears, and endowed with supreme fortitude. ||113||  He was devoted to good
conduct, a bearer of hardships, a Muni, who performed the purificatory fasts of
the sixth, eighth, and other months. ||114||  His mind was absorbed in
meditation and study, he was free from ego, a conqueror of the senses, free from
the desire for future enjoyments, he was supremely peaceful, and a great devotee
of the teachings. ||115||  He was skilled in non-violent conduct, devoted to the
welfare of the monastic order, and free from desire even for a single hair of a
child. ||116||  His body was adorned with the dust of his unwashed feet, he was
free from attachment, a Digambara, he stayed for one night in a village and five
nights in a city. ||117||  His abode was in the caves of mountains, on the banks
of rivers, or in beautiful gardens, he had renounced attachment to his body, he
was steadfast, silent, learned, and devoted to right austerities. ||118||  Thus,
Shri Chandra Muni, having acquired these virtues, wore out the cage of karma,
attained the time of his liberation, and became the lord of the Brahma world.
||119||  There, in his supreme abode, he was endowed with splendor, fame,
brilliance, and radiance, he was illuminated by the jewel on his head, and

the gods of the Saudharma heaven, endowed with great wealth, stood waiting for
him, their minds filled with longing. ||122||  1. साध्वङ्गे म०।

308 Padma Purana He delighted in a divine chariot adorned with jewels and a net
of pearls, a spectacle for the eyes of divine women. ||23|| O Vibhishana, even
Brihaspati could not describe the glory of this Sri Chandra's living Brahma,
even in a hundred years. ||124|| This supreme jewel, this unparalleled secret,
is manifest in the three worlds, but the foolish do not know the Jain teachings.
||125|| Having learned the greatness of the Muni Dharma and the Jina, those who
are deluded by false pride turn away from the Dharma. ||126|| The child, the
ignorant one, who delights in the pleasures of this world, even while taking
care of himself, does harm to himself, which even an enemy would not do. ||127||
Because of the complexity of karma-bandha, not everyone becomes a holder of the
three jewels. Even some, having obtained them, abandon them again due to
dependence on others. ||128|| O noble ones, do not delight in the Dharma that is
condemned, embraced by many wicked people and full of faults. Be kind to your
own nature. ||129|| There is no liberation from suffering outside the Jain
teachings. Therefore, O noble ones, with undivided devotion, constantly worship
the Jinas. ||130|| Thus, the story of Dhanadatta, who attained the human state
from the state of the gods, and the state of the gods from the human state, is
narrated. ||131|| Now, I will briefly describe the wanderings of Vasudatta,
etc., who, due to the complexity of karma, assume various forms. ||132|| Then,
in the city of Mrinalakunda, there lived a king named Vijayasen, powerful and
radiant with glory. His wife was Ratna Chula. ||133|| They had a son named
Vajrakambu, and his wife was Hemvati. They had a son named Shambhu, famous in
the world. ||134|| His chief priest was Sribhuthi, a seer of the ultimate truth,
and his wife was Saraswati, endowed with excellent qualities. ||135|| The
virtuous woman, whom I have mentioned before, was for a long time in the lower
realms, deprived of the right Dharma due to the influence of her karma. ||136||

Shadduttarashata Parva 306 Deluded by infatuation, she was repeatedly subjected
to the misery of womanhood. Defamed by the slander of the ascetics, she attained
the state of an elephant on the banks of the Mandakini. 138 Bound by a powerful
wind, her steady form became unstable. Releasing a faint sigh, her eyes
blossomed. 136 Seeing her about to die, the compassionate Khecara brought her
the Karṇajapa mantra. 140 Due to the reduction of her passions, the renunciation
of that region, and the grace of Shri-bhuti, she became the daughter of the
Vedavati. 141 Seeing the mendicant monk enter the house, she mocked him,
whereupon her father made her a Shravika. 142 The kings of the earth, especially
Shambhu, were eager to obtain that supremely beautiful maiden, Vedavati. 143
Although a heretic is equal to Kubera in wealth, the priest declared that she
would not be given to him. 144 Enraged, Shambhu killed the priest at night. By
the grace of the Jina-dharma, the priest attained divinity. 145 Then, Shambhu,
driven by lust, attempted to forcibly marry the goddess-like Vedavati, who was
unwilling. 146 With his lustful mind, he embraced and kissed her, and proceeded
to engage in sexual intercourse with her. 147 Thereupon, she, extremely enraged
like a flame of fire, her heart detached, her body trembling, lamented the
destruction of her virtue and the murder of her father. 148-149 "O wicked one!
You have committed the sin of killing my father, for which I shall now destroy
you." 150

310 Padma Purana Even though my father has passed away, I will not abandon his
wishes. It is better to die than to desire a man of false vision. ||15|| Having
gone to the Harikanta Aryika with great enthusiasm, she took the vows and
performed extremely difficult austerities. ||152|| Her hair stood on end, and
her body became so dry from the austerities that it seemed as if there was no
flesh left, only bones and veins were visible. ||153|| At the end of her life,
she attained the Brahma heaven and enjoyed the pleasures of the gods, obtained
through her good deeds. ||154|| Without Vedavati, Shambhu became completely
destitute in the world. He lost his brothers, servants, and Lakshmi, and became
a deranged fool. ||155|| He was filled with false pride and turned away from the
words of the Jinas. He mocked the monks and spoke harshly to them. ||156||
Shambhu, who consumed honey, meat, and liquor, and was eager to approve of sins,
wandered for a long time in the hells and animal realms, experiencing intense
suffering. ||157|| Then, due to some lessening of his sinful karma, a son was
born to Savitri, the wife of the Kushadhvaja Brahmin. ||158|| His name was
Prabhasakunda. He obtained the three precious jewels and took initiation from
the Muni Vichitra Sena. ||159|| He was free from lust, pride, anger, and envy.
He was compassionate and had conquered his senses. He performed austerities
without any attachment. ||160|| He fasted for two days, three days, and one
night, and had given up all desires. He stayed in desolate forests, where the
sun sets. ||161|| He was endowed with good qualities and character, and was a
great bearer of hardships. In the summer, he was eager to bask in the sun,
wearing a garment made of dirt. In the rainy season, he would get drenched under
the trees by the rain. In the winter, he would stay on the banks of rivers,
covered in a garment of snow. ||162-163|| Thus, engaged in such practices,
Prabhasakunda once went to the Siddha Kshetra, Sammed Shikhar, to pay his
respects, remembering the destruction of his sins. ||164||

## One Hundred and Sixty-Six Chapters  The glorious one, known as Kanakaprabha,
saw the prosperity of the learned ones there. Even though he was peaceful, he
was still moved by the waves in the sky. ||165||  Enough of this talk of wealth,
I need liberation. If there is any greatness in my austerities, I will attain
such sovereignty. ||166||  Oh, look at the foolishness born from evil deeds! He
sold a jewel, priceless in the three worlds, for a handful of greens. ||167||
At the time of their rise, they prosper, and at the time of their decline, they
fall. What can anyone do here, due to the influence of their karma? ||168||  His
soul, tainted by the nidāna, performed extremely severe austerities. He ascended
to the heaven of Sanatkumara and enjoyed pleasures there. ||169||  Fallen from
there due to the remnants of his good deeds, his mind was consumed by the memory
of pleasures. He was born as Ravana, the son of Ratnashrava and his wife Kaikesi
in the city of Lanka. ||170||  There, according to the nidāna, he attained that
great sovereignty, whose actions were extremely luxurious, in which great
wonders were performed, and which had spread throughout the world with its
prowess. ||171||  That one, who was the lord of the Brahma-loka, after staying
there for a time equal to ten oceans, fell and was born as Rama, the son of
Dasharatha. His mother was Aparajita. Due to the remnants of his past good
deeds, a man equal to Rama in prosperity, form, and valor is rare in the world.
||172-173||  That one, who was previously Dhanadatta, became this beautiful
Rama, who, with his fame, has filled the world like the moon. ||174||  That one,
who was previously Vasudatta, then became the Brahmin Sribhuti, and in turn,
became this Lakshmana, the embodiment of the Narayana-pada, the tree for the
vine of Lakshmi. ||175||  That one, who was previously Srikanta, became Shiva in
due course, then Prabhasakunda, and now Ravana. ||176||  He is Ravana, who
subdued the entire three parts of the Bharat-kshetra, as if they were held in
the grip of his fingers. ||177||  She, who was previously Gunavati, then became
Sribhuti's daughter in due course. She was born as Sita, the daughter of King
Janaka. ||178||  He who, upon being remembered, destroys sin. ||162-164||

In the Padma Purana, it is stated that the wife of Baladeva was Vinayashālini,
who was the daughter of Indra and was as virtuous as Shachi. The brother of this
virtuous lady became the supremely virtuous Bhāmaṇḍala, who was the dear friend
of Rāma. The goddess Amṛtavatī, who resides in Brahmaloka, descended at the same
time as the one adorned with earrings. Their union in the womb of Queen Videha
resulted in the birth of an immaculate and charming pair of siblings.  The one
who was previously the Brāhmaṇa Yajñavali is now Vibhīṣaṇa, and the one who was
Vṛṣabhaketu is now Sugrīva, the monkey-bannered one. All of you are born from
the pious actions of Rāma due to your previous affection and merit.  Gautama
Svāmī then narrates to King Śreṇika the previous birth of Bali, as described by
the Kevalin. In the endless cycle of saṃsāra filled with the torments of
attachment and aversion, a certain creature was a black deer in the Vṛndāvana
forest. Hearing the sound of the ascetics' recitation, that deer attained the
excellent human birth in the city of Diti, known as Airāvata.  This person had a
father named Vihīta, who was of right vision and good conduct, and a mother
named Śivamati. Their son was Meghadatta, who observed the aṇuvratas and was
devoted to the worship of the Jinas. At the end of his life, he attained
samādhimaraṇa and was born in the Aiśāna heaven.  Meghadatta's soul then
descended from the Aiśāna heaven and was born as the beautiful son named
Suprabha to the couple Kāntaśoka and Ratnākinī, who lived in the prosperous town
near Vijayāvatī in the eastern Videha region. Suprabha was surrounded by many
kinsmen and was fond of virtuous conduct.  Having attained the rare Jain faith
in the saṃsāra, he accepted the vows of the great ascetic Saṃyata.

## The Hundredth Chapter of the Padduttara  **313**  Thus, the great sage
Supriya, with a noble mind and vast heart, performed severe austerities for many
thousands of years, according to the rules. ||14||  Even though he was endowed
with various attainments, he did not become proud. He also renounced all
attachment to the feelings arising from association. ||15||  The great sage, who
had attained the first stage of white meditation, which is the state of the
cessation of passions, would have attained the state of Siddha, but his lifespan
was not long enough. Therefore, he attained the state of सर्वार्थसिद्धि
(perfection in all aspects) in the same state of cessation. ||16||  After
enjoying great happiness for thirty-three oceans of years, he was born as Vali,
the powerful king of the Vidyadharas. ||17||  He obtained a kingdom filled with
various treasures on the Kishkindha mountain. His brother, Sugriva, was endowed
with great virtues. ||18||  Even though he was in great conflict with the king
of Lanka, Ravana, he renounced his claim to the kingdom for the sake of
compassion. ||19||  He, the virtuous one, freed Mount Kailasa, which had been
lifted by Ravana in his pride and strength, by simply pressing his toe on it.
||20||  Burning the forest of existence with the fire of his supreme meditation,
he ascended to the top of the three worlds and attained the state of his own
true nature. ||201||  Srikanta and Vasudatta, due to their great enmity, killed
each other in many births. ||202||  In the previous birth of Vedavati, the soul
of Ravana desired to be associated with Sita. Due to this karmic influence, he
abducted Sita in his birth as Ravana. ||203||  When Ravana was Shiva, he, being
lustful, killed Sribhuta, a knower of the Vedas, a great Samyagdarshi, for the
sake of Vedavati. ||204||  Sribhuta, after ascending to heaven, fell from there
and was reborn as Vasu in the city of Pratiṣṭhāna. Due to sorrow, he performed
austerities with the intention of attaining liberation and was born in the
heaven of Sanatkumara. ||205||  After falling from there, he was born as
Lakshmana, the younger brother of Rama, a wielder of the discus, and a great
devotee of Rama. ||206||  This valiant Lakshmana, due to the unbreakable enmity
from a previous birth, killed the soul of Shiva, who had become Ravana. ||207||
Since Sita's soul had suffered the pain of separation from her brother in a
previous birth due to Ravana's soul, she became the cause of Ravana's
destruction. ||208||  1. विलोकाग्रं म (vilokagraṁ ma) - the top of the three
worlds 2. दशाननभयं म० (daśānana bhayaṁ ma) - the fear of Ravana  40-3

##  Chapter 314 of the Padma Purana  **20.** Ravana, who had crossed the ocean
and killed Lakshmana while he was on the earth, was a fierce and violent being.
**21.** Lakshmana, having killed Ravana, who was the moon to the Rakshasas,
conquered the entire earth, including the oceans.  **21.**  The Kevalis say,
"Where is such a hero, and where is such a feat? This is the greatness of karma,
that even the impossible is achieved."  **212.** Thus, there is a constant
exchange between the slayer and the slain. The one who is slain in one existence
becomes the slayer in the next, and the one who is the slayer in one existence
becomes the slain in the next. This is the state of beings in the cycle of
existence.  **213.** Where are the supreme pleasures in heaven, and where is the
intense suffering in hell? Oh, how contrary are the actions of karma!  **214.**
Just as a great quantity of the most delicious food is contaminated by poison,
so too is the most excellent austerity contaminated by its cause.  **215.** To
contaminate austerity for the sake of its cause is like cutting down a
Kalpavriksha to plant a field of millet, or watering a poisonous tree with
nectar, or grinding a garland of precious gems for a thread, or burning
sandalwood from the head of a cow for charcoal.  **216.** In the world of living
beings, a woman is a mine of all vices. What kind of evil deed is there that she
does not commit?  **217.** Karma, once performed, inevitably returns to bear its
fruit. Who can change this in the three worlds?  **218.** If those who have
embraced Dharma attain this state, what can be said of those who are devoid of
Dharma?  **219.** Even those who have embraced the path of a monk, but who are
envious of the objects of their pursuit, do not attain liberation, even if they
perform severe austerities. They are still bound by the burning passions.
**220.** One who has no peace, no austerity, and no self-control, due to false
views, what means does such a wicked soul have to escape the cycle of existence?
**221.** Where elephants intoxicated with pride are carried away by the wind,
there the rabbits who live on land are already taken away.  **222.** Thus,
knowing the cause of these great sufferings, let people who are concerned with
their own welfare not engage in the bond of enmity.

## The Hundred Verses of Pattuttar  **Chapter**  Even in India, one should not
speak ill of those who give charity. See, Sita received slander merely from
words. ||224||  There was a village called Mandalik, and a Muni named Sudarsana
came there. People went to greet him after he arrived at the Muni's garden.
||225||  Sudarsana, his sister, was standing there, and the Muni was speaking
good words to her. Vedavati saw this, and she was a true Shraman. ||226||  Then,
eager to show her own right view, she spoke to the villagers, "Look, you should
see this Muni, he is beautiful. I saw him sitting alone with a beautiful woman."
Some people believed her, but not the wise ones. ||227||  The people
disrespected the Muni, and he vowed not to eat until this slander was removed.
Vedavati's face was flushed with shame, and she said to the Muni, "I, a sinner,
have spoken falsely about you." She was inspired by the city deity. ||228||
Thus, she apologized to the Muni and convinced the others. In this way, Sita, in
her previous birth as Vedavati, falsely slandered the brother and sister, and
therefore she received this false accusation in this birth. ||229-231||  Even if
a real fault is seen, it should not be spoken of to those who follow the Jina's
teachings. And if someone else speaks of it, one should try to stop them with
all one's might. ||232||  Those who speak of faults that cause hatred in the
world, and are related to the teachings, will suffer for a long time and wander
in the cycle of birth and death. ||233||  It is a great virtue of the jewel of
right view to try to hide even a fault that has been committed. ||234||  One who
reveals the false faults of others out of ignorance or jealousy is completely
outside the Jina's path. ||235||  Hearing this wonderful teaching of the Muni,
the gods, demons, and humans were filled with great wonder. ||236||  Knowing the
cause of great suffering, O aspiring beings who desire your own welfare, do not
cultivate enmity with anyone. ||223||

In the Padma Purana, knowing the fierce enmity between Lakshmana and Ravana, the
entire assembly trembled with great sorrow and fear, becoming devoid of envy.
The sages were terrified by the world, the gods were filled with extreme
anxiety, the kings were overwhelmed with worry, and some were awakened.  Many
who were proud of their eloquence shed their pride and became peaceful.  Even
those who were harsh in their actions due to the strong influence of karma,
attained right faith.  The assembly, momentarily stunned by the intensity of
karma, gasped, "Alas! What a sight!"  Humans, Asuras, and gods, with folded
hands, bowed their heads to the sage and praised Vibhishana, saying, "O Blessed
One! We have heard this excellent, enlightening, and virtuous story through the
grace of the sage's feet, thanks to your shelter."  Then, filled with joy, all
the kings, gods, and sages, along with their retinues, praised the omniscient
God.  "O Lord, adorned with all virtues! You have adorned these three worlds,
therefore your name 'Sakalabhusana' is truly meaningful."  Your wealth of
knowledge and insight, devoid of comparison, shines brightly, rejecting all
other forms of wealth.  This world, orphaned, unstable, and miserable, bound by
birth, old age, and death, has been suffering since time immemorial.  But today,
through your grace, it has attained the supreme self-realization, the Jain path.
O Kevalin! O one who has accomplished his purpose! For us, who are afflicted by
various diseases, old age, separation, and death, who are like a herd of deer
frightened by a hunter, and whose souls are trapped by harsh and inauspicious
great karmas that are difficult to escape, may this karma quickly be destroyed.

**One Hundred and Six**  **Verse 248**  In the dense darkness of the world,
where beings are lost in the objects of sense, you are a lamp, O Lord! You are a
lake for those who are tormented by the intense thirst for liberation. You are a
fire to burn the forest of karmic aggregates, and you are the sun for those who
are agitated by the fall of the great snow of various sorrows.  **End of the One
Hundred and Sixth Chapter**  **Verse 106**  Thus ends the One Hundred and Sixth
Chapter of the **Sri Padma Purana**, known as **Sri Arsha**, composed by **Ravi
Sena Acharya**, which describes the previous births of **Ramadeva** along with
his entourage.

The commander, Krtaantavaktra, having heard the seven hundred and one chapters
and thus knowing the great suffering of the cycle of birth and death, said to
Deemaabhikhazya, "I am overwhelmed with sorrow."  ||1||  "Wandering in the path
of falsehood, in this endless world, I am now filled with sorrow. I wish to
embrace the life of a Shraman." ||2||  Pabhanaabha then said, "How can you bear
this extremely difficult path, abandoning this supreme love?" ||3||  "How will
you endure the intense cold, heat, and other hardships? How will you bear the
words of wicked people, which are like sharp thorns?" ||4||  "You, who have
never known the touch of sorrow, who are as delicate as the heart of a lotus,
how will you spend the night on the ground in a forest filled with wild
animals?" ||5||  "You, whose bones and veins are clearly visible, who have
fasted for a long time, how will you accept alms in a vessel held in your hand
in another's house?" ||6||  "You, who have never endured the army of enemies,
filled with elephants and chariots, how will you bear the humiliation of defeat
from low-born people?" ||7||  Krtaantavaktra then replied, "For one who is
capable of abandoning this love, which is like a sweet nectar, what else is
unbearable?" ||8||  "Until the body, like a pillar, is felled by the thunderbolt
of death, I wish to escape from this world, which is a trap of suffering and
blindness." ||9||  "Just as compassionate people do not keep those who have
escaped from a house engulfed in flames, so too, compassionate people do not
keep those who have escaped from the world, which is burning with suffering."
||10||  "Even if it is not now, separation from you, like a great man, will
surely come in the future. Then, who, understanding the evil of the world, will
not seek the welfare of their soul?" ||11||  "It is true that the suffering
caused by your separation will be unbearable. But may such suffering never be
experienced again. This is the thought that has arisen in my mind." ||12||

The distressed Raghava, bound by the rules of the seven hundred and one
chapters, spoke with difficulty. "You are blessed, having abandoned wealth like
me, and are now inclined towards the virtuous path." (3) "If you do not attain
Nirvana in this life, and are a god, then I, in distress, am worthy of being
enlightened by you." (14) "If you consider even a single favor done by me, then
do not forget it, make this vow, O noble one." (15) Saying, "As you command, so
shall it be," and bowing as per the rules, the commander-in-chief, filled with
intense detachment, approached the Kevala, the Lord of all ornaments. (16)
Bowing down, he renounced all external and internal attachments, his face was
serene, he was valiant, he had left behind worldly entanglements, and his
actions were graceful. (16-17) Thus, many great kings, attaining supreme
detachment, filled with great fervor, embraced the vow of non-attachment, having
received initiation. (18) Some became Shravakas, and some attained right faith.
Thus, the assembly, adorned with the three jewels, was filled with joy. (19)
When the Lord of all ornaments departed from that mountain, the gods and demons,
bowing with devotion, went their respective ways. (20) With eyes like lotus
petals, Rama, bowing to the Kevala, the Lord of all ornaments, and to the saints
who were devoted to attaining liberation, in due order, approached Sita, who was
radiant with pure brilliance, and who was resplendent like a flame born from the
ghee offering. (21-22) She stood peacefully amidst the group of Aryikas, her own
rays of light were shining, she had beautiful, calm eyebrows, and she seemed
like another pole star surrounded by a group of stars. (23) She was firm in her
adherence to right conduct, she had renounced garlands, perfumes, and ornaments,
yet she was adorned with a family of fortitude, fame, love, fortune, and
modesty. She was wearing soft, white, smooth, and long garments, and she seemed
like a holy river whose foam was being stirred by a gentle breeze, or like the
clear autumn season with its abundance of blooming reeds. (24-26)

12. In the Padma Purana, She appeared as if she were the very embodiment of the
blessings bestowed upon those who have renounced the world, or as if she were
the very goddess of the Jina's teachings, who embodies the form. ||27|| Seeing
Sita like this, his mind shattered by confusion, Balarama stood still, like a
Kalpa tree. ||28|| His eyes and brows, naturally steady, fixed upon her, he
contemplated her, like a mountain standing near the clouds of autumn. ||26||
This is the best army, residing within the cage of my arms, or the moon's
crescent, naturally, for my eyes, which are like lotuses. ||30|| Even when she
was with me, she was terrified by the sound of the clouds, how will this ascetic
woman, in the forest, not be afraid? ||31|| With the weight of her hips, she
walked with a graceful, languid gait, this delicate Sita will surely be
destroyed by austerity. ||32|| Where is this body, and where is the austere
penance of the Jina? What effort is there in burning a lotus, for one who burns
a tree with fire? ||33|| She who has eaten the most delightful food, as she
wished, how will she accept whatever alms she receives? ||34|| She who, with the
auspicious sounds of the vina, flute, and mridanga, slept in a heavenly abode,
like a celestial palace, how will this timid Sita spend the terrifying night in
the forest, filled with the sounds of birds and deer? ||35-36|| See, my mind is
filled with delusion, what have I done? I have abandoned my beloved, driven by
the slander of ordinary people. ||37|| Where is another woman who is favorable,
dear, virtuous, the most beautiful in the entire world, who speaks sweet words,
and is the land of happiness? ||38|| Thus, his mind overwhelmed by the burden of
worry, he was extremely distressed, and trembled, like a wavering moon. ||39||
Then, remembering the words of the Kevali, his tears stopped flowing, and with
great difficulty, his eagerness subsided, and he was free from fever. ||40|| She

bowed to her with devotion and affection. ||4||  Narayana, with a gentle soul,
also joined his hands in salutation and greeted Sita, following the footsteps of
Padmanabha. ||42||  "You are blessed, O Bhagavati! You are worthy of worship,
the bearer of excellent conduct. You are like the earth, holding the Meru, the
mountain of virtue. Therefore, you are worthy of our worship." ||43||  "You have
first obtained the supreme nectar of the Jina's words, by which you will cross
the ocean of samsara." ||44||  "May this be the path for all other virtuous
women, with beautiful minds, praised in both worlds." ||45||  "You have brought
your soul, your family, and the world under your control by practicing this kind
of kriyayoga, with a pure heart." ||46||  "Whatever we have done, good or bad,
should be forgiven, for those who are attached to the state of samsara stumble
at every step." ||47||  "O Peaceful One! O Mindful One! By being devoted to the
Jina's teachings, you have filled my heart with immense joy, even though I was
filled with sorrow." ||48||  Thus praising Sita, Rama and Lakshmana, with joyful
hearts, proceeded towards the city, with Lavana and Ankusha leading the way.
||49||  The Vidhyadhara kings, filled with immense joy, were moving ahead, their
bodies trembling with wonder. ||50||  In the midst of thousands of kings, the
two handsome heroes, surrounded by gods like Indra, entered the city. ||51||
Before them, queens, riding on various vehicles, restless and accompanied by
their retinues, were following the proper protocol. ||52||  Seeing Rama
entering, the women, perched on the towers of the palace, were engaged in
conversation, filled with various emotions. ||53||  "This is Sri Baladeva, the
proud one, devoted to purity. He has abandoned his beloved, even though he is a
scholar." ||54||  "This is a beautiful act done by this one, born in a pure
lineage, for the sake of the men, who are like the pillars of the world." ||55||
Who could have stopped Sri Rama from becoming free from suffering in any way?

199 In the Padma Purana, Sita, who is pure and virtuous, has been unjustly
accused. Who would not know that she brings happiness to the mind? ||56|| Some
were saying, "Oh friend! Look at Rama, bereft of Sita. He appears like the moon
without moonlight and the sun without radiance." ||57|| Others said, "What can
the beauty of another do for him? He is himself supremely beautiful, the wise
Balarama." ||58|| Some said, "Oh Sita! What have you done by abandoning such a
great husband? You are truly hard-hearted like a thunderbolt." ||59|| Some said,
"Sita is supremely blessed, wise, devoted to her husband, and a true woman. She
has left the misery of her home, seeking her own good." ||60|| Some said, "Oh
Sita! How could you leave these two delicate, joy-giving, and supremely devoted
sons?" ||61|| The love of women for their husbands may sometimes waver, but
never for their sons nurtured by their own milk. ||62|| Some said, "These two
princes are the best of men, nourished by virtue. What is the mother doing here?
Everyone is engaged in their own karma, receiving the fruits of their actions."
||63|| Thus, the women, engaged in conversation and eager to see Rama, were not
satisfied, like bees that never find enough honey. ||64|| Many noble men, seeing
Lakshmana, said, "This is Narayana, adorned with the wonderful Lakshmi, who has
conquered the world with his power, who holds the discus in his hand, who is
radiant, the lord of Lakshmi, the best of all, and who is, as it were, the
embodiment of the vow of widowhood for the enemies of the gods." ||65-66|| Thus,
Rama and Lakshmana, praised and worshipped by the crowds of the city, entered
their home like Indra himself entering his celestial chariot. ||67||  This is
the way it is. What they have done is right. ||55||

## Chapter One Hundred and Eight  The king, Shrenik, having heard the story of
the destruction of the wicked, was filled with doubt and sorrow. He thought,
"Even though Sita has broken the bond of affection that had grown so strong, how
will she, with her delicate body, be able to endure the great austerities?"
He saw that the two sons, Lavana and Angusha, who had eyes like those of a deer,
were endowed with all prosperity and radiance, yet they had been deprived of
their mother. Now, with only their father left, how would these two sons, who
had been raised in constant comfort, bear the pain of their mother's loss?
When even the most powerful and noble men face such adversity, what hope is
there for others?  Thinking this, King Shrenik said to the Ganadhara, Gautam, "I
have faith in the truth of what the Omniscient has seen about the world."  Then,
Indrabhuti, the Ganadhara, began to tell Shrenik the story of Lavana and
Angusha.   He said, "O King! In the city of Kakand, there lived a king named
Rativardhana. His wife was named Sudarshana, and they had two sons named
Priyankara.    The king had a minister named Sarvagupta, who, though he bore the
burden of the kingdom's wealth, secretly harbored a rivalry with the king and
was eager to find ways to kill him.   The minister's wife, Vijayavali, was
devoted to the king. She secretly informed the king of her husband's schemes.
The king, though outwardly unconvinced, believed her in his heart.  Vijayavali
then revealed a sign to the king, saying, "Tomorrow, in the assembly, the
minister will provoke a quarrel with you. He will speak rudely to you."  The
king, who was free from the desire for other women, accepted this information
intellectually, but not outwardly.    Outwardly, the king said, "O Vijayavali!
He is my devoted servant. How could he speak disrespectfully to me?  I have
never been treated so poorly by Vijayavali."

## English Translation:  **13.** Knowing the sign of conflict, the king, by
means of forgiveness, prevented the arrival of misfortune.  **14.** The wicked
minister, thinking, "This king is angry with me," instigated all the
feudatories.  **15.** That night, the great minister, with a large amount of
fuel, set fire to the king's residence, but the king was always vigilant.
**16.** The wise king, taking his wife and two sons, escaped through a secret
passage in the wall, slowly and stealthily.  **17.** He then went to the king of
Kashi, Kasipa, a just and powerful ruler, who was his feudatory.  **18.** When
the all-knowing minister was established in the kingdom, he sent a messenger to
Kasipa, saying, "Kasipa, pay your respects to me." Kasipa replied,  **19.** "He
who commits treason against his lord is a wicked wretch destined for suffering
and misery. Such a wicked person is not even worthy of being named, let alone
served."  **20.** "He who burned his lord, Rativardhana, along with his wife and
sons, is a traitor to his lord, wife, and children. Even remembering him is not
worthy."  **21.** "I will surely cut off the head of this sinner in front of
everyone, and take revenge for Rativardhana."  **22.** Thus, the wise man, like
a wise person who discards false beliefs, dismissed the messenger and his words,
and focused on the task at hand.  **23.** The eyes of Kasipa, devoted to his
lord, and powerful, were always fixed on the minister, who was ready to attack.
**24.** The all-knowing minister, accompanied by many kings, and a large army,
like a chakravarti, was urged by the messenger and arrived.  **25.** Although
the all-knowing minister, vast like the ocean, had entered the wide expanse of
Kashi, Kasipa did not desire peace but was determined to fight.  **26.** The
messenger sent by King Rativardhana to Kasipa, carrying the rod of punishment,
arrived and entered during the night.  **12.** How can a person who is supremely
devoted speak against his lord like that? What you have said is impossible.

A young man, holding a staff, arrived before King Kasipa and said, "O King! You
are blessed because King Rativardhana is here."  Filled with joy, Kasipa, his
face beaming, asked, "Where is he? Where is he?" 26-27. "He is in the garden."
Upon hearing this, Kasipa, overflowing with happiness, went out with his inner
court, carrying offerings and water for washing the feet. 28. "Rativardhana, the
king who cannot be conquered, is victorious." Thinking this, Kasipa celebrated
his arrival with great gifts, honors, and festivities. 29. Later, in battle,
Sarvagupta was captured alive, and King Rativardhana gained the kingdom. 30. The
vassals who had previously pledged allegiance to Sarvagupta, upon learning that
their lord Rativardhana was alive, abandoned Sarvagupta in the midst of the
battle and went to him. 31. A grand birth-festival was held for King
Rativardhana, with great gifts, honors, and worship of the deities. 32.
Sarvagupta, the minister, was banished to the outskirts of the city, living like
a Chandala, his spirit broken, like a dead man. No one dared to look at him, and
he became despised by all. 33. King Kasipa, the ruler of Kashi, adorned with a
great radiance, enjoyed himself in Varanasi with the most exquisite Lakshmi,
like another Lokapala. 34.  Later, King Rativardhana, weary of worldly
pleasures, took Jain initiation from the Muni named Subhanu. 35. Sarvagupta,
convinced that his wife Vijayavali was responsible for this betrayal, harbored
intense hatred for her. 36. Vijayavali, lamenting that she could not be the
king's wife nor her husband's, performed severe austerities and became a
Rakshasi. 37. Driven by intense animosity, she inflicted great suffering upon
Rativardhana, the Muni. However, he, absorbed in deep meditation, attained the
kingdom of pure knowledge. 38.  Rativardhana's sons, Priyankara and Hitakara,
embraced the pure path of Munihood and were born in the Praiveyaka. In their
previous birth, in the fourth existence, they were two Brahmanas named Vasudeva
and Vasudeva, born in the city of Shamali to a Brahman named Damadeva. 40.

## The One Hundred and Eighth Chapter: The Previous Births of Lavana and Angusha
**The Story of Visva and Priyangu**  Visva and Priyangu were the wives of
Sudeva, a virtuous son. Their household life was commendable to the wise. [41]
**The Journey to the North Kuru**  They gave generous donations to the sage
Sritilaka with pure intentions. As a result, they attained a lifespan of three
palya in the North Kuru, a land of great pleasure, along with their wives. [42]
**The Abode of the Great Gods**  They enjoyed the great fruits born from the
tree of virtuous deeds and donations. After enjoying these pleasures, they
attained the abode of the Great Gods. [43]  **The Birth of Priyankara and
Hitaankara**  After leaving the abode of the Great Gods, they were born as
Priyankara and Hitaankara, sons of King Rativardhana. They were endowed with the
Lakshmi of knowledge and their karma of evil deeds had diminished. [44]  **The
Liberation of Rativardhana**  The sage Rativardhana, through the fire of pure
meditation, burned away the forest of karma and attained liberation. [45]  **The
Transformation of Priyankara and Hitaankara**  The heroes Priyankara and
Hitaankara, who were described briefly, were born as Lavana and Angusha, having
transcended the cycle of birth and death. [46]  **The Sorrow of Queen
Sudarshana**  King Rativardhana's queen, Sudarshana, was deeply devoted to her
sons. Due to the nature of women, she was overwhelmed with grief at the
separation from her husband and sons. [47]  **The Cycle of Rebirth**  Bound by
the chains of karma, she wandered through the cycle of suffering. She endured
the hardships of womanhood and experienced various births. [48]  **The Birth of
Siddhartha**  Through the influence of her past good deeds, she was born as a
human named Siddhartha. She was virtuous, a devotee of Dharma, and skilled in
the knowledge of scriptures. [49]  **The Education of Lavana and Angusha**
Siddhartha, with her love for her sons, Lavana and Angusha, educated them in
various disciplines. They became so accomplished that even the gods were unable
to defeat them. [50]  **The Importance of Dharma**  Thus, know that parents are
always easily available to beings in the world. Wise people should strive to
perform actions that liberate them from the suffering of the body. [51]  **The
Path to Liberation**  Abandon all karma, the cause of worldly growth and the
source of great suffering. O noble ones, practice the austerities prescribed by
Jainism, reject the sun, and strive for liberation. [52]  **The End of the
Chapter**  Thus ends the One Hundred and Eighth Chapter of the Padma Purana,
narrated by the Acharya Ravishena, which describes the previous births of Lavana
and Angusha. [108]

The Navottara Shata Parva describes Sita's renunciation of her husband and son,
and her subsequent initiation into Jainism. Here's a translation preserving Jain
terms:  1. The Navottara Shata Parva tells of Sita, whose endeavors were
renowned throughout the world, renouncing her husband and son, and becoming a
Jain ascetic. Listen to what she did. 2. At that time, the glorious, all-adorned
Kevali was present, possessing divine knowledge, understanding both the world
and the beyond. 3. He had made all of Ayodhya adept in the practice of household
life, prosperous, and adorned with the right Dharma. 4. All the people were
steadfast in the words of the Bhagavan, as if a king, adorned with an empire,
was protecting them. 5. At that time, the people were celebrating the right
Dharma, were of great fortune, possessed right knowledge, and devoted to the
worship of the Sadhus. 6. The Tirtha, the destroyer of worldly existence, of
Muni Suvrata Nath, was shining brightly, just as the interval between the Arnath
and Mallinath Jinas was shining. 7. Sita, who surpassed even the beauty of the
celestial nymphs, became withered by her austerities, like a burnt Madhavi
creeper. 8. She was always filled with great fervor, free from impure thoughts,
and considered womanhood as something to be condemned. 9. Her chest and hair
were always covered with dust from the earth, and she wore a garment of dirt,
born from sweat, due to lack of bathing. 10. She performed the Parana, as
prescribed by the scriptures, after four days, a fortnight, and a season, was
devoted to the practice of good conduct and the fundamental virtues, free from
attachment and aversion, focused on spiritual contemplation, completely
peaceful, and had brought her mind under control. 11. She performed extremely
difficult austerities, unbearable to others, abstaining from all flesh, with her
bones and intestines visible, and renounced all earthly possessions, taking
refuge in a wooden image.

The Navottara Shata Parva  A being whose cheeks had sunk in, covered only by
skin, with a high, dry brow, resembling a dried-up river. She walked the earth
for a period of time equal to a Yuga, with a gentle gaze, taking alms according
to the rules, protecting her body through tapas. She had become so otherworldly
through tapas that even her own people could not recognize her in the streets.
Seeing her, people would always tell her story. Those who saw her once and then
again could not recognize her as the same being.   In this way, she performed
excellent tapas for sixty-two years, and then, after performing the perfect
Sallekhana for thirty-three days, she abandoned her body, like a discarded
garment, and ascended to the Aran-Achyuta realm, attaining the position of
Pratyindra.   Gautama Swami says, "Behold the greatness of Dharma in the Jina's
teachings! This being, having abandoned the female form, became a male, the lord
of the gods!"  In that Kalpa, where the sky was illuminated by the brilliance of
jewels, and where the presence of gold and other precious substances created a
wondrous and extraordinary spectacle, she attained the position of Pratyindra in
the Achyuta heaven, residing in a celestial chariot resembling the peak of Mount
Meru, filled with her family, and possessing supreme wealth.   There, she was
the object of the gaze of hundreds of thousands of goddesses, and, surrounded by
a retinue of stars, she shone like the moon.   In this way, King Shrenik heard
from the mouth of Gautama Ganadhar many other excellent stories and ancient
tales that destroy sin.   Then, King Shrenik asked, "At that time, in the Aran-
Achyuta Kalpa, who was the lord of the gods, the Indra, who was so glorious that
even the Indra of the gods, Sita, was his rival in terms of tapas?"  In
response, Ganadhar Bhagwan said, "At that time, Madhuka was the Indra of the
Aran-Achyuta heaven. His brother was Katabha, and he enjoyed the great wealth of
Indra for twenty-two oceans.   After the passage of sixty-four thousand years,
in due course, due to the influence of his remaining good deeds, Madhu...

In the Padma Purana, it is said that Pradyumna and Samba, the sons of Krishna,
were born in Dwarika in the Bharat Kshetra.  The difference between the Ramayana
and the Mahabharata is 64,000 years.  Arista-nemi, the Tirthankara, fell from
heaven and was reborn as Madhu in the Bharat Kshetra, as the son of Vasudeva and
Rukmini.  The king of Magadha said to Gautam Swami, "O Lord, just as a wealthy
person is never satisfied with wealth, I am not satisfied with your words, which
are like nectar."  "O Lord, please tell me the story of Achyutendra Madhu. I
wish to hear it. Please be gracious to me."  "O Ganendra, who is devoted to
meditation, please tell me the full story of Madhu's brother, Kaidabha, as you
know it well."  "What good deeds did he perform in his previous life? How did he
obtain the three jewels, which are extremely rare and the best in the three
worlds?"  "O Lord, your words are revealed step by step, and my mind is also
grasping the subject step by step. My heart is also becoming very eager. In this
way, everything seems appropriate."  Gautam Ganadhar said, "In the Magadha
country, which is full of all kinds of grains, where the four varnas are very
happy, which is full of dharma, artha, and kama, which is adorned with beautiful
chaityalayas, which is filled with cities, villages, and mines, which is very
beautiful with rivers and gardens, and which is full of assemblies of sages,
there was a great king named Nityodit at that time. In the same country, there
was a village called Shaligram, which was equal to a city."  "In that village,
there was a Brahmin named Somadev. His wife was Agnila, and they had two sons
named Agnibhuti and Vayubhuti."  "Both of these sons were proficient in the six
rituals, including Sandhya-vandana, they were experts in the Vedas and
scriptures, and they were full of pride in their scholarship, thinking, 'Who is
better than us?'"  "Due to the great fire of pride, they were filled with
excessive madness. They thought, 'Enjoyment is always worthy of being enjoyed,'
and they turned away from dharma."

The Navosarashatam Parva  A Muni named Nandivardhana, accompanied by many
virtuous ones, was wandering this earth.  He arrived at Shaliagrama. ||46||
This Muni, through his Avadhi-jnana, saw the entire world.  He stayed outside
the village in a garden suitable for the virtuous. ||42||  Hearing of the
arrival of these great Shramanas, the people of Shaliagrama, with great pomp,
went out to meet them. ||43||  Seeing the people of the town going out in a
large group, Agnibhuti and Vayubhuti asked someone, "Where are these people
going, all together in a group?" ||44||  He told them, "A Digambara Muni,
without any clothes, has arrived.  They are all going to pay their respects to
him." ||45||  Then, filled with anger, Agnibhuti, along with his brother, went
out and said, "I will defeat all the Shramanas in a debate." ||46||  Approaching
the Shramanas, he saw their leader, Nandivardhana Muni, seated in the midst of
them, like the moon rising among the stars. ||47||  Then, Satyaki, the chief of
the Shramanas, said to them, "O Vipras, come and ask your questions to the
Guru." ||48||  Agnibhuti, laughing, said, "What do we want from you?"  The Muni,
with composure, replied, "There is no fault in your coming here." ||49||  One of
the Brahmanas said, "These two have come to defeat these Shramanas in a debate.
Why are they sitting so far away?" ||50||  "Very well," said the two Brahmanas,
filled with anger, and sat in front of the Muni.  With great arrogance, they
repeatedly asked, "What do you know? What do you know?" ||51||  The Muni, with
Avadhi-jnana, said, "Where are you two coming from?"  The Vipras replied, "Don't
you know that we are coming from Shaliagrama?" ||52||  The Muni said, "I know
you are coming from Shaliagrama.  My question is, in this endless forest of the
world, from what state are you coming?" ||53||  They said, "Does anyone else
know this, or only I?"  Then the Muni said, "Listen, O Vipras, I will tell you."

In the Padma Purana, At the edge of the village, in the forest, two jackals
lived together. They were both deformed in appearance and loved each other
dearly. || 55 || In the same village, there lived an old farmer named Pramaraka.
One day he went to his field. When the time for sunset arrived, he was overcome
with hunger and went home, leaving his tools behind, thinking he would return
soon. || 56-57 || He had not yet reached home when suddenly, dark clouds like
the mountains of Ajjanagiri descended upon the earth, pouring rain day and
night. These clouds calmed down after seven days, meaning it rained continuously
for seven days. The two jackals mentioned earlier, driven by hunger, emerged
from the forest in the dense darkness of the night. || 58-59 || Then, the
jackals ate all the tools left behind by the farmer, which were soaked in the
rain and covered in mud and stones. After eating, they experienced severe pain
in their stomachs. Finally, afflicted by the rain and wind, the two jackals died
as a result of their karma and were reborn as the sons of Somadev, a Brahmin. ||
60-61 || After that, the farmer Pramaraka went to his field in search of his
tools. There, he saw the two dead jackals. The farmer took the dead jackals home
and made their skins into bags. || 62 || Soon, the farmer Pramaraka also died
and was reborn as the son of his own son. He regained his memory of his past
life, which made him mute. || 63 || "How can I speak to my son from my previous
life, knowing him as my father? And how can I speak to my daughter-in-law from
my previous life, knowing her as my mother?" Thinking this, he embraced silence.
|| 64 || "If you don't fully believe this, then the Brahmin has come here to see
me and is sitting among his family." || 65 || The Muni Raja called him and said,
"You are the same farmer Pramaraka, and now you have been reborn as the son of
your own son." || 66 || This is the nature of the world. Just as an actor on
stage becomes a king and then a servant, and a servant becomes a king, in the
same way, a father becomes a son, and a son becomes a father. A mother becomes a
wife, and a wife becomes a mother. || 67-68 || 332 1. त्वक्तोपकरणं म० । 2.

The Navottara Shata Parva 333  In this world, which is like a potter's wheel,
souls go up and down due to their karma. Knowing this, you should condemn this
worldly state. Now, give up your silence and speak words that are beneficial.
Upon hearing this, the man was overjoyed. He got up, his fever gone, his body
tingling with joy, his eyes and face beaming. He circled the Muni, as if
possessed by a spirit, and then fell at his feet, like a tree that has been cut
down.  He said, "Oh, you are all-knowing! You see the state of all beings, even
while sitting here. I was drowning in the terrible ocean of samsara, but you, my
Lord, have shown me the three jewels of knowledge out of compassion for all
beings. You have divine wisdom, so you know my thoughts."  Saying this, he
renounced his family and took initiation. This story of the former merchant is
well-known. Many people in the world became monks and lay followers. They went
to his house and saw the bags made from the skins of the jackals, which caused a
lot of commotion and wonder.  Then, Gautam Swami said, "Oh King! People laughed
at these Brahmins, saying, 'These are the same jackals who eat meat, now they
have become Brahmins.' These two Brahmins, who are deluded by the philosophy of
'Brahman is everything,' and who are addicted to killing animals, have cheated
all the people who desire happiness. These pure monks, who are rich in tapasya,
are superior to Brahmins. True Brahmins are those who follow the vow of non-
violence. Those who wear long hair, which is like a great vow, who have the
yajnopavita of forgiveness, who perform fire sacrifices through meditation, who
are peaceful, and who are dedicated to achieving liberation, are called
Brahmins. On the other hand, those who are involved in all kinds of beginnings,
who are always unchaste, are called Brahmins in name, but not in deed.

In the Padma Purana, Just as there are many people named after lions, gods, or
fire, So too are there many who call themselves Brahmanas, but are actually
fallen from their vows. || 83 || These are the true Brahmanas, who are diligent,
wealthy, Rishis, controlled, wise, patient, gentle, and with conquered senses.
|| 84 || They are auspicious, free from doubt, blessed, and full of austerities,
Munis, ascetics, heroes, dwelling in transcendental qualities. || 85 || Those
who wander in search of liberation, abandoning attachment to the world, They are
known as Parivrajakas, truly free from attachments and pure. || 86 || They
diminish themselves through austerity, with diminished passions and full of
forgiveness. They destroy sin, and are therefore called Kshapanas. || 87 || They
are Yamins, free from passions, with liberated bodies, without attachments,
Yogis, meditators, bound by knowledge, wise, and without desire. || 88 || They
are called Sadhus, because they achieve Nirvana, And they are called Acharyas
because they always practice and teach good conduct. || 81 || They are endowed
with the qualities of a renunciate, and they eat only pure alms, Therefore they
are called Bhikshus, and they are called Shramanas because they perform pure
actions, or destroy karma, and they are engaged in the highest form of Shrama.
|| 60 || Hearing this praise of the Sadhus and the condemnation of themselves,
Those arrogant sons of Brahmanas became ashamed, humiliated, and without glory,
and they went to a secluded place. || 61 || Then, those two sons, who were
deeply saddened by the mention of their previous births as jackals, etc., Went
in search of the place where the Lord Nandivardhana Muni was residing, after the
sun had set. || 62 || That Muni was dwelling in a secluded part of the forest,
free from attachments, having abandoned his community, In a cremation ground
full of deep pits, full of Narakankalas, filled with various pyres, Filled with
the sounds of carnivorous wild animals, swarming with ghosts and snakes, So dark
that it could be pierced by a needle, and whose sight was intensely repulsive.
In such a cremation ground, on a stone slab devoid of living beings, He was
seated in a posture of meditation, observed by those two evil ones. || 65 ||

The Navottara Shata Parva  The two wicked men, with swords drawn and enraged,
shouted together, "People, come and protect his life! Where are you going now,
Shraman?"  || 36 || "We Brahmanas are the best on earth, we are the direct
manifestation of the gods. You are shameless, full of great sins, and yet you
call us 'jackals'!" || 67 ||  Then, the two wicked men, with fierce anger and
bloodshot eyes, cruel and devoid of compassion, were observed by the Yaksha. ||
18 ||  Sumana thought, "Look, these wicked men are about to kill this innocent,
detached, and meditative Muni." || 33 ||  Then, as they stood ready to strike,
the Yaksha immobilized them, leaving them standing still and motionless. || 100
||  Wishing to harm the great Muni, the two cruel men stood by his side like
guards. || 101 ||  Then, at the time of the pure dawn, the Muni, having
completed his yoga, emerged from his secluded place and sat in the open. || 102
||  At that moment, the fourfold Sangha and the people of Shaligram arrived, and
seeing this scene, they exclaimed in astonishment, "Oh, who are these wicked
men?  Shame on these wicked men who are intent on causing harm!  These
troublemakers are the same as the fiery and windy ones!" || 103-104 ||  The
fiery and windy ones also thought, "Oh, what a great power this Muni has! He has
immobilized us, who are full of pride in our strength." || 105 ||  "When we are
freed from this state, if we live, we will surely see the great Muni." || 106 ||
Meanwhile, Somadev, filled with anxiety, arrived with his wife Agnila and tried
to please the Muni. || 107 ||  The couple, eager to massage his feet, bowed
repeatedly and showered him with many kind words. || 108 ||  The Muni saw those
two wicked men. || 63-65 ||

336 Padmapurana O Dev, let these wicked sons of mine live, release your anger.
We are your obedient servants, along with all our relatives. ||10|| What anger
can there be for the righteous? What you are saying, we are compassionate
towards all, and for us, friends, enemies, brothers, relatives, etc., are all
the same. ||110|| Then, the Yaksha, whose eyes were extremely red, spoke in a
very deep voice, saying, "This act of the Guru Maharaj should not be spoken of
in the midst of the people." ||111|| For those who see the righteous and feel
disgust towards them, they quickly meet with misfortune. Wicked people do not
see their own wickedness and blame the righteous. ||112|| Just as a person
looking at himself in a mirror, whatever face he makes, he surely sees the same.
||113|| Similarly, a person who is eager to go in front of the righteous, to
stand up, etc., gets the same fruit as the feeling he has. ||114|| He who laughs
at the Muni, gets weeping in return. He who speaks harsh words to them, gets
conflict in return. He who kills the Muni, gets death in return. He who harbors
hatred towards them, gets sin in return. ||115|| Thus, by doing such blameworthy
acts towards the righteous, the doer of such acts gets the same fruit. ||116|| O
Vipra, your sons are driven by their own accumulated sins and their own actions,
and they have been struck down by me, not by the righteous Maharaj. ||117||
These sons of yours, who are burning with pride in the Vedas, are very harsh,
they practice blameworthy actions, and they are violent towards the restrained
righteous, let them die, what harm is there in that? ||118|| The Brahmin, with
folded hands and head bowed, began to appease both the fierce, angry, and
fearsome Yaksha and the Muni Maharaj. ||119|| The one who had raised his arm,
who was shouting loudly, who was blaming himself and his sons, and who was
beating his chest, the Vipra was in great distress. ||120|| 1. Kutilau Shri. Ti.

## The Hundred and Ninth Chapter  337  The Muni said, "O Kamalalochan, O
beautiful Yaksha, forgive the fault of these two whose minds are clouded by
delusion." (121)  "You have shown great affection for the Jina's teachings, O
virtuous one. But, O Bhadra, it is not right to kill living beings for my sake."
(122)  Saying, "As you command," the Yaksha released the two Vipra sons. Then,
both Vipra sons, comforted, approached the Guru's feet with devotion. (123)
They bowed their heads, circumambulated, and offered salutations. Seeing them
incapable of taking on the difficult practices of a Sadhu, the Muni said, "You
two, adorned with Samyagdarshan, should take on the Anuvrata." (124)  Following
his instructions, they became wise Shravakas, devoted to the happiness of
household life. (125)  Their parents, devoid of proper faith, wandered in the
ocean of existence without Dharma after death. (126)  But Agnibhuti and
Vayubhuti, free from doubt, were imbued with the spirit of the Jina's teachings.
They renounced worldly actions like violence as if they were poison. Therefore,
after death, they became excellent Devas in the Saudharma heaven, where they
enjoyed divine, great happiness that delighted all senses and the mind.
(127-128)  Then, they were born in Ayodhya as sons of Dharini, the wife of the
wealthy merchant of the sea. (129)  Their names were Purnabhadra and
Kanchanabhadra. These two brothers lived happily. Later, they again embraced the
Shravaka Dharma and, through its influence, became Devas in the Saudharma
heaven. (130)  This time, they were born in Ayodhya, as sons of King Hemnabha
and his queen Amaravati, who had fallen from heaven. They were known in the
world as Madhu and Kaithabha. These two brothers were invincible, beautiful, and
as terrifying as Yama. (131-132)  Gautama Swami says, "O King, just as wise
people control their intellect, these two conquered this earth filled with
Samantas and brought it under their control." (133)  But a powerful king named
Bhima did not obey their orders. He took refuge in the city, like a chameleon
hiding in a forest. (134)

338 Padma Purana A letter was sent by Veer Sena to the king. All the houses on
earth were destroyed by the fire of Bhima. ||135|| Then Madhu, filled with
anger, quickly went towards Bhima with all his army and warriors. ||136|| He
reached Nyagrodha Nagar on his way. King Veer Sena, filled with joy, entered the
city. ||137|| The moon, the king of the world, saw Chandrakanta, the beautiful
wife of Veer Sena. ||138|| He thought, "It would be good to live with her in the
Vindhya forest. Without Chandraabha, my kingdom is not complete." ||139||
Thinking this, the king defeated Bhima in battle and subdued all his enemies.
But his mind was still on Chandraabha. ||140|| He returned to Ayodhya and called
all the kings with their wives. He gave them many gifts and sent them away with
honor. ||141|| Veer Sena was also called. He went with his wife and stayed
outside Ayodhya in the garden on the banks of the Sarayu river. ||142|| He was
then invited with honor and entered Madhu's palace with his queen. After some
time, he was sent away with great gifts, but Chandraabha was sent to the inner
palace. The innocent Veer Sena did not know that his beautiful beloved had been
kept there. ||143-144|| Then, by the coronation of the great queen, Chandraabha
received the coronation and became the head of all the goddesses. ||145|| Madhu,
whose mind was blinded by pleasures, felt like Indra, immersed in the ocean of
happiness with Chandraabha, who was like Lakshmi. ||146|| 1. Udaradar M.

## The One Hundred and Ninth Chapter  This King Vira Sena, knowing that his
beloved had been abducted, became mad and did not find any pleasure anywhere. ||
147 ||  He became a disciple of a sage named Mandava, who was fond of water. He
embraced the five-fold fire penance, astonishing the foolish people. || 148 ||
One day, King Madhu went to the Dharma-asana and discussed matters of state with
his ministers. || 149 ||  The valiant king, endowed with the virtues of a king,
entered the inner palace when the sun was about to set, as truth is always
auspicious. || 150 ||  Chandrabha, distressed, said to him, "My lord, why have
you been away for so long? We have been suffering from hunger all this time." ||
151 ||  He replied, "This case concerning another man's wife is a tricky one,
and it cannot be left unfinished. That is why I have been away for so long." ||
152 ||  Chandrabha laughed and said, "What is wrong with loving another man's
wife? If someone finds another man's wife dear, then he should be worshipped
according to his desire." || 153 ||  Hearing these words, King Madhu, enraged,
said, "Those wicked men who are lustful for another man's wife are certainly
deserving of punishment, there is no doubt about it." || 154 ||  "Those who
touch another man's wife or speak to her, such wicked, low-born men are worthy
of punishment with five kinds of punishments and should be banished from the
country. And those who are not deterred from their evil ways and are deeply
infatuated with another man's wife, that is, those who indulge in another man's
wife, are surely destined for hell. How can such people be worthy of worship?"
|| 155-156 ||  Then, the lotus-eyed queen Chandrabha, interrupting, said, "Oh,
you are a great devotee of Dharma and are dedicated to the welfare of the
earth." || 157 ||  "If this is considered a great sin for men who desire another
man's wife, then, O King, why don't you punish yourself for this?" || 158 ||
"You are the first among those who go after another man's wife. Why are others
blamed? For it is well known that as the king is, so are the people." || 159 ||
"Where the king himself is cruel and lustful for another man's wife, what is the
point of legal proceedings? Let the kingdom be free from such things." || 160 ||
Here, when King Vira Sena learned that his beloved had been abducted, he went
mad and did not find any pleasure anywhere. || 147 ||  Finally, to give joy to
the foolish people, King Vira Sena became a disciple of a sage named Mandava,
and, astonishing the foolish people, he began to perform the five-fold fire
penance. || 148 ||  One day, King Madhu was sitting on the Dharma-asana,
discussing matters of state with his ministers. It is right, for truth, endowed
with the virtues of kings, is auspicious. Because he was busy with state affairs
that day, the valiant king reached the inner palace when the sun was about to
set. || 149-150 ||

340 Padmapurana From which seeds sprout and which is the life of the world. If
fire is born from water, then what else can be said? ||161|| Hearing such words,
Madhu was speechless. He repeatedly said to the goddess, "It is so." ||162||
Even so, bound by the fetters of wealth, he could not escape the ocean of
sorrow. For one who is attached to pleasures is not freed from karma. ||163||
After a long time, filled with perfect knowledge and happiness, the virtuous
Singhpada, a great soul, arrived in Ayodhya. ||164|| He stayed in the beautiful
Sahasraamra forest. Hearing this, Madhu went to him with his wife and followers.
||165|| After bowing to the guru in the prescribed manner, he sat on the ground
and, having heard the Dharma preached by the Jina, he became detached from
pleasures. ||166|| Knowing the pain of hell, he immediately renounced the great
kingdom and the princess who was unmatched in beauty on earth. ||167|| Knowing
that wealth is fleeting, his brother Katabha also became a monk. Thereafter,
Madhu wandered the earth, burdened by the great austerities of monastic life.
||168|| The king Madhu, who was a delight to the eyes of all, his own people and
others, protected the earth and his kingdom. ||169|| Madhu, a great soul,
performed the most severe and excellent austerities for hundreds of years. At
the end, he died in the prescribed manner and, free from battle, attained the
position of Indra in the Aranachuta heaven. ||170|| Gautama Swami says, "Oh! The
influence of the Jina's teachings is amazing, for even those whose past lives
were so reprehensible have attained the position of Indra. Or what is surprising
in attaining the position of Indra? For those who strive, they go to the city of
liberation." ||171|| What is the purpose of seeing? First, you should attain
health. ||160|| From which the origin of the body takes place and which is the
life of the world, if fire is born from water, then what else can be said?
||161|| Hearing such words, King Madhu was speechless and repeatedly said to
Chandrabhasa, "It is so." ||162|| Even so, bound by the fetters of wealth, he
could not escape the ocean of sorrow. For one who is attached to pleasures is
not freed from karma. ||163|| After a long time, filled with perfect knowledge
and happiness, a muni named Singhpada, a great soul, arrived in Ayodhya. ||164||
And he stayed in the very beautiful Sahasraamra forest. Hearing this, King Madhu
went to him with his wife and followers. ||165|| After bowing to the guru in the
prescribed manner, he sat on the ground and, having heard the Dharma preached by
the Jina, he became detached from pleasures. ||166|| The princess, who was of
high lineage and unmatched in beauty on earth, and the vast kingdom, he
renounced immediately, knowing the pain of hell. ||167|| On the other hand,
Madhu's brother Katabha also became a monk, knowing that wealth is fleeting.
Thereafter, Madhu wandered the earth, burdened by the great austerities of
monastic life. ||168|| The king Madhu, who was a delight to the eyes of all, his
own people and others, protected the vast earth and kingdom. ||169|| The great-
souled Madhu muni performed the most severe and excellent austerities for
hundreds of years. At the end, he died in the prescribed manner and, free from
battle, attained the position of Indra in the Aranachuta heaven. ||170|| Gautama
Swami says, "Oh! The influence of the Jina's teachings is amazing, for even

## Navottarashatam Parva ### 341 Anushtup The birth of Madhu Indra has been
narrated by me to you. Sita, the rival, was born as the queen of the underworld.
||172|| From here onwards, I narrate the story of the eight valiant Kumaras,
which captivates the minds of the wise. O Sun of Kings, Shrenik Maharaj, listen
to this tale, which is the cause of the destruction of sin. ||173|| Thus ends
the 109th Parva of the Padma Purana, known as the "Madhupaakhyana", narrated by
the Acharya Ravishena, in the tradition of the Rishis. ||106||

## Dashadhikashatam Parva  **Verse 1:**  In the city of Kanchanasthan, there
were two daughters of Kanchanarath, who were proud of their beauty. Their
mother's name was Shatada.  **Verse 2:**  For the purpose of their Swayamvara,
their father, with great enthusiasm, sent out messengers to all the kings of the
earth and the Vidyadharas.  **Verse 3:**  A letter was also sent to the king of
Ayodhya, informing him of the Swayamvara and requesting him to send his
daughter.  **Verse 4:**  Rama and Lakshmana, filled with curiosity, sent their
sons, who were endowed with great wealth.  **Verse 5:**  Then, those princes,
filled with mutual love, set out for Kanchanasthan, carrying their weapons,
Lavana and Ankusha.  **Verse 6:**  They rode on hundreds of Vimanas, surrounded
by groups of Vidyadharas, and appeared like divine princes, adorned with
Lakshmi, as they traveled through the sky.  **Verse 7:**  Their armies grew
larger and larger as they saw the distant earth, and they reached the excellent
city of Kanchanarath.  **Verse 8:**  In the assembly hall, adorned with various
ornaments, like a divine assembly, stood two rows of Vidyadharas and kings of
the earth, arranged according to their rank.  **Verse 9:**  The kings, adorned
with all their splendor, were present in the assembly, displaying various
skills, like the gods in Nandana.  **Verse 10:**  On the next day, auspicious
for the ceremony, the two daughters, Hri and Lakshmi, emerged from their
dwelling, possessing excellent qualities.  **Verse 11:**  Kanchuki, the king of
Kanchanasthan, described to the daughters the country, lineage, wealth, skills,
and names of all the kings who had come for the Swayamvara.  **Verse 12:**
"These Vidyadharas are seated here, with banners of monkeys, lions, tigers,
bulls, and snakes. O excellent daughters, look at them one by one."  **Verse
13:**  Seeing the daughters, the kings felt shy and their radiance dimmed. They
were seen to be caught in a web of doubt.

## The Hundred and Tenth Chapter  Those who are seen by the maidens, adorn
themselves with their ornaments, and become fickle, forgetting their actions and
their place. (14)  The princes, overwhelmed by the pride of their beauty, are
filled with anxiety, wondering which of them will be chosen by these maidens.
(15)  They think, "Have these maidens, who are the banners of Kamadeva, the
cause of the world's madness, conquered the worlds of gods and demons?" (16)
Seeing the Lavanaankusha, they were pierced by the arrows of Kamadeva and stood
still. (17)  The elder daughter, Mandakini, with her captivating gaze full of
love, accepted Ananga Lavana. (18)  The other excellent maiden, Chandra Mukhi,
with her beautiful face and auspicious fortune, accepted the Madanaankusha,
which was her due. (19)  Then, in that army, arose a mighty roar of Halahal,
accompanied by the victorious roar of the lion, causing great commotion. (20)
It seemed as if the sky and the directions were being torn apart by the minds of
the people, filled with intense shame, flying all around. (21)  "Oh! We have
seen this auspicious and excellent union, where these maidens have accepted the
sons of Rama," said the wise men. (22)  Mandakini, the Ganges, deep and renowned
throughout the world, has gone to the Lavana, the salt sea. Thus, this maiden
named Mandakini, going to this Lavana, Ananga Lavana, has not done anything
inappropriate or incomplete. (23)  Chandra Bhagya, who is ready to conquer the
beauty of the entire world, has done a very appropriate thing by accepting the
Madanaankusha. (24)  Thus, the words of the noble people spread everywhere in
that assembly. For the hearts of the noble are filled with joy by good
connections. (25)  The eight valiant sons of Lakshmana, Vishalya and others,
with their beautiful minds, were renowned like the eight Vasus. (26)  They,
filled with love for their two hundred and fifty brothers, shone like planets
amidst the stars. (27)

344 Papuraane Those other sons of Lakshmana, who were strong and full of vigor,
were ready to attack Lavana and Ankusha out of anger, because they were the sons
of Vaidehi. ||28|| Then, those eight valiant brothers, who were eager to show
off their prowess, were calmed by those beautiful maidens, just as a group of
snakes is calmed by mantras. ||26|| Those eight brothers, along with the other
brothers, said, "Brothers, be at peace. What is to be done with these two
auspicious maidens now? Women are naturally deceitful, and those whose minds are
attached to other men are even more so. So, who is the noble-hearted one who
would desire to be afflicted by their affections? Even though these maidens have
conquered the goddesses, what use are they to us? Therefore, if you wish your
own well-being, turn your minds away from them." ||30-32|| Thus, by the words of
those eight Kumaras, the group of brothers was subdued, just as a group of
horses is subdued by reins. ||33|| At the place where those excellent maidens
had chosen the sons of Sita, a tumultuous sound of music arose. ||34|| The
flutes, conch shells, drums, cymbals, and kettledrums, which filled the entire
horizon, made a beautiful sound that captivated the minds and ears. ||35|| Just
as the lesser gods are filled with sorrow when they see the glory of Indra, so
too were the sons of Lakshmana filled with distress when they saw the glory of
the Swayamvara. ||36|| They thought, "We are the sons of Narayana, adorned with
brilliance and radiance, endowed with youthful vigor, possessing excellent
helpers, and powerful. ||37|| What quality are we lacking that these maidens did
not choose any of us, but instead chose the sons of Janaki, abandoning us all?"
||38|| Or, what is the wonder in this? This is the way of the world. Due to the
strange workings of karma, this world of moving and unmoving beings is strange
indeed. ||39|| Whatever is destined to be obtained by whom, where, how, and why,
is surely obtained by him there, in that way, and for that reason. ||40|| 1.

The Hundred and Tenth Chapter 345 Thus, when the sons of Lakshmana began to
grieve, the son of Rupavati, whose wonder had ceased, laughed and said, "O good
men! Why are you grieving for a mere woman? Your actions are causing great
laughter." [41-42] "What do we have to do with these girls? We have obtained the
light of the Jinesvara, the messenger of liberation, that is, the form of the
Jina-mudra has become the root of our minds. Why then, like fools, are you
grieving over this again and again?" [43] "Those who are like banana stalks,
empty and with their souls destroyed, are under the control of desires. They are
not worthy of grief or laughter." [44] "All beings are under the control of
karma. Why do you not do that which destroys karma?" [45] "Lost in the dense
forest of existence, living beings are experiencing such sorrows. Therefore,
destroy that forest of existence." [46] "O brothers! This is the land of karma,
but due to the grace of our father, we, with our minds clouded by delusion,
consider it heaven." [47] "In my childhood, while sitting in my father's lap, I
heard a very beautiful thing read from a book, that the human birth is rare in
all existences. One who does not do his own good after obtaining it is cheated."
[48-49] "This being obtains wealth through giving, heaven through austerity,
liberation through knowledge, and a painful destiny through sin." [50] "Knowing
that rebirth is certain, if we do not perform austerity, then we will have to
obtain again a painful destiny full of sorrows." [51] Thus, those valiant
princes, terrified by the whirlpool of suffering in the ocean of existence,
attained enlightenment. [52] And soon, going to their father, bowing down, and
standing respectfully, with folded hands, they spoke in a very sweet voice,
"Father, listen to our request. You are not capable of creating obstacles. We
wish to take initiation. Please make it possible." [53-54] "Seeing this world as
fleeting like lightning and devoid of essence, we are filled with great fear."
[55] "We have now attained the highest enlightenment, by which we will cross the
ocean of existence." [56] 1. Nivritte M. | 2. Yani M., J. | 3. Vilokya Diyate

The Five Great Puranas  We wish to abandon from afar those enjoyments which are
as fearful as the hoods of the venomous serpent, whose essence is doubt and
whose nature is like fire, and which are the cause of supreme suffering. ||5||
Neither mother, nor father, nor brother, nor relatives, nor friends are of any
help in protecting this body, which is subject to karma. ||58|| Father, we know
the unparalleled affection you and our mothers have for us, but this is a great
bondage for worldly beings. ||5|| How long can the happiness arising from your
affection last? Even after enjoying it, separation is inevitable, and such
separation is as terrible as a crocodile. ||59-60|| When this being, satiated
with enjoyments, abandons this body like a wicked friend, what is gained then?
||61||  Then Lakshmana, overwhelmed with love, smelled his sons on their heads
and looked at them again and again, saying, "These palaces, which are like the
peaks of Kailasa, are made of gold and jewels, adorned with thousands of golden
pillars, have diverse and beautiful grounds, are adorned with beautiful
balconies, are fit for enjoyment, are pure, are beautiful, are equipped with all
kinds of amenities, are filled with fragrant breezes like those of the Malaya
mountain, attracting bees, have various pure lands suitable for bathing and
other rituals, are white like the autumn moon, have women like celestial nymphs,
are endowed with all virtues, are like the palaces of heaven, are delightful
with the music of the vina, flute, mridanga, etc., and are extremely pure due to
the stories of the Jina's life, are standing before you, dear children! How will
you, after living happily in these palaces, take initiation and live in the
forests and mountains? ||62-68|| My dear sons, it is not proper for you to leave
me, who am bound by affection, and my mother, who is consumed by grief.
Therefore, enjoy your wealth. ||69||  1. फणान् भीमान् म -  hoods of the venomous
serpent 2. शङ्कासुखानल -  doubt and whose nature is like fire 3. तथास्मासु म -

The Hundred and Tenth Chapter 347 Those whose minds were attached to affection,
who were afraid of the world, who were completely averse to the pleasures
obtained by the senses, who were adorned with the support given by noble
heroism, and whose minds were engaged in contemplating the truth, all those
Kumaras, after a moment's reflection, said: "In this world, mothers, fathers,
and others have come and gone countless times. This house is like a prison for
those who are bound by affection.  70-72. Fools serve this cage-like house,
which is the ultimate beginning of sin and which increases various sorrows, not
the wise.  73. We will act with firm determination so that bodily and mental
suffering will not befall us again. Are we our own enemies?  74. Even though a
householder thinks, "I am innocent, I have no sins," he still becomes stained
like a white cloth that is kept.  75. Because those who dwell in the household
experience suffering again and again, and because they find pleasure in sin,
great souls have abandoned the householder's dharma.  76. You have said, "Enjoy
wealth well," but you are throwing us into a dark well, even though you are
wise.  77. Just as a hunter kills a deer that is drinking water from thirst, so
death kills a man who is not satisfied with pleasures.  78. This world, attached
to the attainment of objects, is dependent, ignorant, and without medicine. It
plays with snakes in the form of desires.  79. These men, like fish, who are
immersed in the reservoir of the house and attached to the flesh of objects, are
caught by death through the power of the flute of disease.  80. Therefore, the
Lord of the human world, the Lord Jinendra, who is worshipped by the three
worlds, has said that the world is subject to its own karma.  81. Therefore, O
father! These pleasures, which have no good outcome, which are the temptation of
loved ones, which are hated by the wise, and which are as fickle as lightning,
are completely attached to them, that is,  1. स्नेहबन्धनमेतद्धि चारकं नारकं

348 Padmapurana When separation from loved ones is inevitable, what is the joy
in this strange world? ||3|| The attachment, "This is mine," is born of
delusion, for the soul alone experiences the pain of coming and going. ||8|| In
the island of false scriptures, filled with the mire of delusion, overflowing
with the foam of sorrow and anguish, swarming with the whirlpools of birth,
rippling with the waves of disease and death, enveloped in the deep abyss of
delusion, churning with the fierce group of crocodiles of anger and other
passions, terrifying with the roar of false logic, shaken by the wind of
falsehood, filled with the salty water of bad destinies, and burning with the
unbearable and intense fire of separation, we have been distressed for a long
time, O father, in this terrible ocean of the world. ||85-88|| After wandering
through countless births, we have attained human existence with great
difficulty. Therefore, we want to do that which will prevent us from sinking
again into this ocean of the world. ||8|| Then, surrounded by their families,
they asked their parents in turn, and the eight valiant princes left the prison
of their home. ||10|| As they left home, those valiant ones, who knew the nature
of the world, had a sense of indifference towards that vast kingdom, just as
there is indifference towards withered grass. ||6|| Then, they went to the
garden called Mahendrodaya and, with great fervor, took the vows of renunciation
from the great sage Mahabale. ||12|| Those who are free from all beginnings,
naked, full of forgiveness, self-controlled, free from all attachments,
detached, and absorbed in meditation, such perfect yogis dwell eternally in
accordance with the law. ||13|| By destroying sin through proper austerities and
restraining merit through spiritual yoga, those who have exhausted all the
worldly illusions have attained the state of Jainism, the infinite bliss. ||14||

## Dashadhikashatam Parva  This Kumaraashtakamangal, whoever reads it with
humility and listens with devotion, all his sins are destroyed, and the sun
shines brightly, and the moon rises. ||15||  Thus ends the Dashoत्तरशतं Parva,
named Kumaraashtakamangala, composed by Acharya Ravishena. ||110||  Those eight
Munis, having destroyed the entire universe, attained the state of Nirvana,
filled with infinite bliss. ||64||  Gautam Swami says, "The man who, with
humility and devotion, reads or listens to the auspicious story of these eight
Kumaras, all his sins are destroyed, and he shines like the sun, and the best
moon rises." ||6||  Thus ends the one hundred and tenth Parva of the Padma
Purana, known as Aarsha, composed by Acharya Ravishena, describing the
initiation of the eight Kumaras. ||110||

The eleventh chapter of the scripture of the Jain Venerable Lord Vira describes
the first Ganadhara (chief disciple) of the Venerable Lord, the excellent among
the virtuous ones, Shri Gautama Swami. He narrated the conduct of Bhāmaṇḍala,
which was like the halo of light.  1. The first, the first among the virtuous
ones, the Ganadhara of the Venerable Lord Vira, narrated the mental inclination
and the conduct of the halo of light.  2. Attached to the nectar-like flowers of
happiness born from the heroic creepers of the great beloved of the Vidyādharas,
the six-footed Bhāmaṇḍala (the bee-like Bhāmaṇḍala) contemplated.  3. He
thought, "I shall undertake the vow of the Digambara ascetics." This lotus-like
group (of women) will undoubtedly conduct itself like a lotus.  4. "In their
separation, my life, not nourished by happiness, will certainly become a
separation (from them)."  5. "The pleasures that are difficult to give up and
difficult to obtain, the unrestrained happiness of passion, I shall first enjoy,
and then I shall do what is beneficial."  6. "The extremely abundant sin
acquired through enjoyments, I shall certainly burn away in a moment through the
fire of pure meditation."  7. "Stationing the army here, I shall engage in the
sport of flying in the vimānas (celestial chariots). I shall expel the cities of
the enemies from all sides."  8. "I shall break the pride of the enemy
elephants, and establish the two lineages in the command (of the kingdom)."  9.
"Accompanied by the beautiful ones, I shall sport on the pleasant rock surfaces
of the emerald and other jewels of Mount Meru."  10. While contemplating such
things, moments became hundreds of years for that Jānaka (Bhāmaṇḍala).  11. "I
have done this, I am doing this, and I shall do this," thus contemplating, he
did not realize that the end of his life had come.  12. One day, while he was
seated on the seventh floor of the palace, a thunderbolt fell on his head, and
he passed away.  13. Although he knew completely the conduct of his previous
births, he was not steadfast in his own emancipation.

## The One Hundred and Eleventh Chapter  Even though it is so long-winded, it
has not been established in self-welfare. ||13|| Those who destroy lust and
sorrow do not have peace even for a moment, because death, who keeps his feet
near their heads, always waits for an opportunity. ||14|| For this perishable
body, which is destroyed in a moment, what does this lowly creature, who is a
slave to worldly desires, not do? ||15|| The one who knows that life is
impermanent, renounces all possessions and does not engage in self-interest, is
destroyed in a state of unfulfilled desires. ||16|| What is the use of a
thousand scriptures if the soul does not find peace? Even one step is enough to
attain peace and contentment. ||17|| Just as a crow with broken wings desires to
fly in the sky but does not put in the effort, similarly, this being desires to
do good deeds but does not put in the effort as required. ||18|| If a person
without effort were to obtain what he desires, then there would be no one in the
world who is deprived or poor. ||19|| The one who gives food and other things to
a guest, a virtuous person, and a guru, and who acts according to the guru's
words, never suffers. ||20||   **Aryan Hymn**  The life of a person whose heart
is troubled by hundreds of different businesses, and who experiences sorrow
every day, is lost like a jewel held in the palm of the hand. ||21||  Thus ends
the One Hundred and Eleventh Chapter of the Padma Purana, composed by the
Acharya Sri Ravishena, known as the Arsha, which describes the journey to the
other world from the Bhamandala. ||111||  **Notes:**  1. Karneti ma. (1) 2.

1. The time passes slowly between the two lotus-like kings (Rama and Lakshmana),
who are bound by the great mutual affection.  2. Those two, residing in the
lotus-forest of supreme sovereignty, rejoice like the two elephants anointed
with sandalwood.  3. In the time when the rivers dry up, engulfed by forest
fires, the ascetics, having taken the vows, stand facing the sun.  4. There, in
the beautiful water-houses and in the gardens replete with all beloved means,
they (Rama and Lakshmana) sport.  5. Fanned by the chowries dripping with the
great fragrance of sandalwood water and the best palm-leaf fans,  6. They,
seated on clear crystal slabs, anointed with sandalwood paste, reclining on the
mass of water-drenched lotus-flower petals,  7. Enjoy the pure, sweet water,
cooled by the contact of cardamom, cloves, camphor and other fragrant
substances.  8. Attended by women skilled in various conversations, they
forcibly bear the cold season as if it were the winter.  9. Where the yogis,
their forms purified by the flowing waters, destroy their inauspicious karma,
seated at the roots of the trees.  10. There, in the dark clouds, the great
mansion shines, on the bank of the ocean-like river, with its high walls.  11.
Residing like the peak of Meru, wearing excellent garments, their bodies
anointed with saffron and using limitless agaru,  12. They stand, like the king
of the Yakshas, as the lotus-pond for the swarm of bees that are the eyes of the
great voluptuous women, enjoying pleasantly.

353 The ascetics, enveloped in the garment of the Dharma-meditation, stand on
the open platforms of the forest at night, their minds absorbed in Dharma-
meditation. 13. At that time, in the cold season, when the trees are destroyed
by the great cold wind, the lotus forests are withered, and people delight in
the sunrise, they reside in the sanctuaries of the palaces as they please. 14.
Their chests are the bases for the play of the breasts of young women. 15. They
make sweet sounds, produced by the vina, mridanga, flute, etc., at will, a
supreme nectar for the ears. 16. They are served by beautiful women, who have
conquered the vina with their voices, with great respect, and are like gods
served by goddesses. 17. Thus, they spend their time happily, endowed with
abundant pleasures, day and night, by the influence of all their good deeds. 18.
Thus, those two supreme men were dwelling happily. O King! Now listen to the
story of Shri Sail Veer. 19. By the influence of his past good deeds, Hanuman,
the son of the wind, enjoys supreme sovereignty in the city of Karna Kundala,
like a god. 20. Endowed with the greatness of the Vidyadharas and the most
excellent actions, Hanuman roams the earth at will, accompanied by thousands of
women. 21. Mounted on an excellent chariot and endowed with excellent splendor,
Shri Hanuman plays like a god in the excellent forests and other regions. 22.
Once, in the spring season, which is the cause of the madness of the world,
adorned with flowers and filled with the fragrance of the beloved, 23. Hanuman,
whose mind was filled with devotion to the Jinas, was delighted and set out
towards Mount Meru, accompanied by his inner palace. 24. He stopped at the peaks
of the Kulachala mountains, which were adorned with various kinds of beautiful
flowers and served by the gods. 25. Those forests were full of intoxicated bees
and cuckoos, and were beautiful to behold because of the many lakes. 26. Those
forests, with their various trees, flowers, and fruits, were enjoyable for
couples, and were adorned with mountains studded with jewels. 27.

The temple, resplendent like a cluster of clouds tinged with the fiery glow of
twilight, is golden, towering like a peak of the sun, adorned with the finest
jewels, of exquisite form, strung with thousands of pearl garlands, embellished
with tiny spheres and mirrors, adorned with tinkling bells, silken banners,
lamps, and yak-tails, with magnificent ramparts, arches, and lofty gateways,
adorned with fluttering banners of various hues, radiant with golden pillars,
profound, with beautiful balconies, impossible to describe in its entirety,
fifty yojanas long and thirty-six yojanas wide. O Kante, this Jina temple
appears like the crown of Mount Meru.  Thus praising the temple to the Mahadevi,
Hanuman, upon reaching its vicinity, descended from the front of his celestial
chariot and, filled with joy, circumambulated it.  Then, leaving all else aside,
he bowed with folded hands and touched his forehead to the image of the Jina
within the inner sanctum, an image endowed with great splendor, resplendent like
the moon amidst the stars, planets, and constellations, seated on a lion throne,
radiating its own immense brilliance, like the autumn sun on the peak of a white
cloud, possessing all auspicious marks.  The sight of the Jina filled the
Vidyadhara queens with immense joy and prosperity.  Their bodies trembled with
delight, their long eyes seemed even longer with joy, they were filled with
supreme devotion, adorned with all manner of ornaments, born into noble
families, and dedicated to the highest ideals. These Vidyadharis, like celestial
nymphs, performed the worship of the Jina.  They offered golden lotuses, lotuses
of ruby, lotuses of moonstone, and other natural flowers, filling the sky with
their fragrance, and countless fragrant incense, born of sacred substances.

156 Hanuman worshipped the Jinas with incense whose smoke rose high, with lamps
having large flames, and with offerings of various kinds of garlands. ||56-58||
Then, anointed with sandalwood, adorned with saffron marks, his body covered
with clothes, free from all sins, his crown marked with the monkey symbol and
shining with a cluster of rays, his face filled with the rays of his eyes, which
were wide open due to joy, Hanuman meditated on the Jina, and repeatedly praised
the image of the Jina, the teacher of gods and demons, with hymns that destroy
sins. ||59-61|| Then, seeing him, the apsaras, who were sitting in a state of
playful delight, showered him with blessings. Placing the veena on his lap, he
produced the nectar of music. ||62|| Gautam Swami says that those whose eyes are
fixed on the worship of the Jina, and whose souls are devoted to the observance
of rules, always hold welfare in their hands. ||63|| For those who are devoted
to the worship of the Jina, and who behold his auspicious sight, nothing
auspicious is unattainable, for they have pure minds. ||64|| To be born in the
lineage of the Shravakas, to have firm faith in the Jina, and to die in a state
of Samadhi, this is the complete fruit of human birth. ||65|| Thus, playing the
veena for a long time, repeatedly praising and worshipping, offering
salutations, and with a new and ever-renewed devotion, Hanuman, with a clear
mind, did not turn his back on the Jinas. He left the Jina temple as if
unwillingly, but with a sense of peace. ||66-67|| Then, mounting a chariot with
twenty thousand horses, he circumambulated Mount Meru, like a great astrologer.
||68|| Like a king of mountains, Hanuman, adorned with beautiful actions, seemed
to be asking for the final permission to leave Mount Meru. ||69|| Then,
showering the best flowers on all the Jina temples, he slowly moved through the
sky towards the Bharat Kshetra. ||70|| Then, filled with extreme love, the
evening embraced the sun, as if she had found her abode on the setting sun, with
a desire to dispel sorrow. ||71|| 1. चित्रवल्ल्युपहारेण-म० ! 2. सूत्रपत्रार्ण ख०

The twelfth chapter of the hundred and twelve chapters. 357 The night was
covered with stars, devoid of the moon, and did not shine at all. ||72||
Descending from there, he slowly settled his army in the beautiful mountain
called Suradundubhi. ||73|| There, the wind carried the fragrance of lotuses and
blue lotuses, and the soldiers were happily engaged in the stories of the Jinas.
||74|| Then, seated on the peak of the chariot, near the Chandrasala, which
resembled Mount Kailasa, ||75|| He saw a luminous orb, emanating from the
celestial path, falling and shining brightly, and the wind turned into darkness.
||76|| He thought, "Alas, in this world, there is no place where death does not
play at will, even among the gods." ||77|| Birth is as fragile as lightning,
meteor, and waves, everywhere. What to speak of other beings, even the gods have
it. ||78|| Whatever is enjoyed in this world by sentient beings is not eternal,
there is no happiness or sorrow in the three realms. ||79|| Oh, the greatness of
delusion, it is endowed with supreme power. For so long, this being has been
wandering in sorrow. ||80|| After wandering through countless births in the
ascending and descending cycles, one attains human birth, but it is a pity that
it is lost as if it was never attained. ||81|| Attached to perishable pleasures,
devoid of good conduct, beings fall into the state of suffering. ||82|| The
senses are fickle, prone to wrong paths, and cause great suffering. They do not
become calm without taking refuge in the path of the Jinas. ||83|| Just as the
poor deer and birds are caught in a net, so too are deluded people caught in the
net of desires. ||84|| He who enjoys desires like poison, is a fool, and in the
end, he burns in the fire of suffering. ||85|| Who would desire a kingdom for a
day, after suffering for a year? Similarly, one should not desire the pleasures
of the senses. ||86||

Jain terms preserved in the translation:  The foolish being, although aware, is
deluded by the thief of delusion. He does not do his own welfare - what greater
suffering than this? ||7||  After enjoying the dharma accumulated in the human
birth in the three worlds, later, like a robbed person, he becomes wretched and
miserable. ||8||  Even after enjoying the pleasures of the devas, when the merit
is exhausted, the conscious being goes somewhere, being assisted by the
remaining karma. ||8||  This has been said by the Lord of the three worlds -
that a being's own karma is his kinsman or enemy. ||10||  Enough of these
condemned, extremely dreadful pleasures, by separation from which we are
certainly afflicted. ||6||  If I do not undertake austerities after abandoning
this dear person, then I will die unsatisfied, like a Chakravarti. ||12||  The
enchanting, extremely difficult to renounce, innocent women, endowed with the
qualities of women, whose desires are fixed on me - how can I renounce them?
||63||  Reflecting thus, he became perplexed for a moment. The awakened
intellect then reproached the heart. ||14||  For a long time, reveling with the
virtuous young women "of great opulence" in heaven, he was also excessively
adorned by the charming women in the human world. ||15||  What being, delighted
in the diverse pleasures of the senses like rivers in the ocean, has become
satisfied? O heart, wandering through various births, even if you are weary, how
can you be agitated? ||66||

##  The Twelfth Night  **Verse 67**  Oh, have you not heard of the dreadful
paths of hell, filled with the fearsome opposition of the fierce, and the dense
forests of sharp swords, which are difficult to traverse?  Do you not desire to
destroy with tapas all the dense karma-mud, born from attachment?  **Verse 68**
Alas, my past time, sunk in the long and contemptible ocean of suffering, has
become utterly meaningless.  Today, having obtained the light of the auspicious
path and auspicious wisdom, I liberate the soul, trapped within the cage of the
world, from the bonds of existence.  **Verse 69**  Thus, with a firm resolve in
my heart, and having seen the true nature of the world of living beings, I, like
the sun, free from the association of clouds, am eager to tread the path of
righteousness.  **End of the 112th Chapter**  Thus ends the 112th chapter of the
Padma Purana, known as the *Hanuman Nirveda*, composed by the venerable Sri
Ravishena Acharya.

## Chapter One Hundred Thirteen  **1.** After the night had passed, the sun,
like molten gold, illuminated the world, just as the words of the virtuous
illuminate.  **2.** The sun, like the Jina, caused the constellations to
disappear and the lotuses to bloom, just as the Jina causes the assembly of the
virtuous to flourish.  **3.** Just as Bharata had asked his friends before
entering the forest of penance, so too did Hanuman, filled with great emotion
and devoid of desire, ask his friends.  **4-5.** Then, the ministers, whose eyes
were filled with sorrow and whose hearts were filled with anxiety, pleaded with
their lord, "O Lord, you are not worthy of making us orphans. O Lord, full of
virtue, be gracious to your devotees and protect them."  **6.** Hanuman replied,
"Even though you are my devoted followers, you are my companions in misfortune,
not my benefactors."  **7.** "Those who, while crossing the ocean of existence,
cause others to fall back into it, how can they be called benefactors? They are
truly enemies."  **8.** "When I suffered great pain in the hells, neither my
mother, father, friends, nor brothers came to my aid. No one helped me."  **9.**
"Having obtained the rare human birth and the knowledge of the Jina's teachings,
it is not right for even a wise person to be negligent for even a moment."
**10.** "Just as I enjoyed pleasures with you, my dear friends, so too is this
intense separation, caused by karma, inevitable."  **11.** "What king of gods,
demons, or humans, bound by their own karma, has not been consumed by the fire
of time and perished?"  **12.** "I have enjoyed pleasures in heaven for
thousands of years, yet I was never satisfied, like a fire that is never
quenched by dry fuel."  **13.** "The giver of coming and going, even stronger
than me, has another name, karma, which has made my body incapable."

14. I wish to cross the insurmountable birth-cycle and attain the state beyond
the womb, where beings are deluded by the difficult journey of the cycle of
existence. 15. When Hanuman, the embodiment of the forest, displayed his firm
resolve, a great sound of weeping arose from the women of his inner palace.
16-18.  Then, skilled in administration and with a mind fixed on auspicious
deeds, he comforted the women, who were overwhelmed with sorrow, with words that
were capable of enlightening them and narrated various stories. He then placed
all his sons in their respective positions in the royal duties. Surrounded by a
vast circle of friends, the king, Hanuman, the son of the wind, departed from
his palace-like chariot. 19-20.  He rode in a palanquin that shone with jewels
and gold, adorned with small spheres, mirrors, lamps, and various kinds of fly
whisks, and was decorated with divine lotuses.  He was headed towards the temple
garden, the abode of supreme bliss. 21.  Seeing his palanquin, adorned with
fluttering flags and garlands, people experienced both joy and sorrow, their
eyes filled with tears. 22-23.  In that magnificent temple garden, adorned with
various trees, filled with the sounds of cuckoos, bees, and sparrows, and
fragrant with the pollen of countless flowers, the renowned sage Dharmaratna
resided. 24-25.  Just as the valiant Bahubali, with a heart filled with
detachment, had previously approached the great mass of jewels, the supreme
yogi, the Lord Rishabha Jinendra, so too did Hanuman, with a heart filled with
detachment, descend from his palanquin and approach the celestial sage
Dharmaratna, who was surrounded by the Charanarshis. 26.  Approaching him, he
bowed down, performed great homage, and then, placing the lotus-like hands on
his head, said, "O great sage! I wish to receive initiation from you and, free
from attachment to my body, live a life free from duality. 13. This karma is
more powerful than I am. My body has become incapable and powerless.

In the Padma Purana, The sage said to the noble-hearted Hanuman, "Very well, let
it be so. Having seen the essence of the world, do what is best for yourself."
||28|| "Your noble mind, which has arisen to attain the eternal state with a
perishable body, is truly commendable." ||26|| Having received this permission
from the sage, Hanuman, filled with the fervor of renunciation, bowed down,
satisfied, and sat on the lotus posture. ||30|| He immediately discarded his
crown, earrings, necklace, and other ornaments, his clothes, and his mental
possessions. ||31|| He broke the chains of his beloved, burned the net of
attachment, severed the bonds of affection, and abandoned happiness, which was
like poison. ||32|| Seeing his body as extremely perishable and harmful, he
extinguished the darkness of delusion with the flame of detachment, and plucked
out the hair on his head with his delicate fingers, which had conquered the
lotus. ||33|| Thus, free from all attachments, a devotee of the goddess of
liberation, a follower of the great vows, and adorned with the goddess of
renunciation, the noble Hanuman shone brightly. ||35|| At that time, seven
hundred and fifty Vidhyadhara kings, inspired by renunciation and devotion to
the Lord, noble-minded, pure-hearted, and filled with great fervor, renounced
their kingdoms for their sons and embraced the path of renunciation. ||36-37||
Thus, those who were extremely happy and free from all blemishes, such as
Vidhyudgati and others, attained the glory of Hanuman, shining like him. ||38||
Then, those who were consumed by the fire of separation, who were filled with
great sorrow, who were deeply compassionate, who were filled with renunciation,
who were noble, who were afraid of the world, who were wise, who were free from
great ornaments, and who were adorned with the ornament of virtue, those queenly
women went to the famous Aryika named Bandhumati, bowed down with devotion,
performed the highest worship, and took initiation. ||39-41|| At that time,
their wealth seemed like withered grass to them. The great people, for the most
part, were deeply devoted to renunciation, like those who are in love. ||42|| I
desire this, therefore, please be pleased with me. ||26-27||

## The One Hundred and Thirteenth Chapter  **363**  Sri Sail, the lion among
mountains, was exalted by the vows, the secrets, and the assemblies. He was a
great ascetic, wise, and adorned with virtues and character. ||43||  He was
praised by the great kings, delighted, and saluted by the Apsaras. He followed
the pure code of conduct, as spoken by the omniscient. ||44||  Having burnt the
accumulation of delusion, he attained the perfect knowledge of the Jinas. Sri
Sail, the best among the ascetics, the sun among men, attained the Siddha state,
the peak of liberation. ||45||  Thus ends the One Hundred and Thirteenth Chapter
of the Padma Purana, narrated by Sri Ravishena Acharya, known as the Arsha,
describing the liberation of Hanuman. ||113||  This is correct, because the best
of men are completely detached from those who are attached to passions. ||42||
In this way, Sri Hanuman, who was like a high mountain of vows, secrets, and
assemblies, was a possessor of the wealth of great asceticism, wise, and adorned
with virtues and character. ||43||  Sri Sail, the great sage, who was praised by
the great kings filled with joy, saluted by the Apsaras, who had burnt the
accumulation of delusion, who was the best among the ascetics, and the sun among

Chapter Fourteen Hundred and Fourteen  Seeing the initiation of the eight young
heroes and Hanuman, Rama laughed and said, "What kind of enjoyment did these
people experience?" || 1 ||  Those who abandon existing pleasures and take
initiation, being farsighted, are surely possessed by planets or controlled by
the wind. || 2 ||  Surely, there are no skilled physicians for them, because
they have abandoned pleasurable desires and settled down. || 3 ||  Thus, the
mind of Ramachandra, who was immersed in the ocean of happiness arising from the
great assembly of pleasures and was under the control of karma, became dull. ||
4 ||  Those who are immersed in the worldly cycle, experiencing only a little
happiness, are usually surprised when they hear of transcendental happiness. ||
5 ||  Thus, for those two, Rama and Lakshmana, who were immersed in great
pleasures and bound by love, time was passing by, being indifferent to dharma,
the principle of righteousness. || 6 ||  Then, on another occasion,
Saudharmendra, adorned with great radiance, possessing supreme wealth, and
characterized by courage and composure, arrived in the assembly of the gods. ||
7 ||  All the ministers, adorned with various ornaments, were serving him, so it
seemed as if Mount Sumeru, surrounded by other smaller mountains, was present.
|| 8 ||  Seated on a throne covered with radiance, Saudharmendra was bearing the
splendor of the Jina, who was seated on the peak of Mount Sumeru. || 9 ||  His
body was adorned with precious gems, shining like the moon and the sun. He was
pleasing with his beautiful form and was a feast for the eyes. || 10 ||  Wearing
a pure garland, radiating great brilliance, he seemed like Mount Nishadha,
bearing the flow of the Sitoda river. || 11 ||  Adorned with garlands, earrings,
armlets, and other excellent ornaments, he was surrounded by gods on all sides,
like the moon surrounded by stars. || 12 ||

## Translation:  **Verse 13:**  The comparison of the moon and stars to Indra
and the gods is made for human beings, because there is a great difference
between the celestial gods and the Jyotishi gods. (Meaning: In the human realm,
the moon and stars appear bright, hence the comparison to Indra and the gods. In
reality, the Jyotishi gods have a greater brilliance than the celestial gods,
and the celestial gods have a greater brilliance than Indra.)  **Verse 14:**
Indra himself was endowed with great power and illuminated the ten directions
with his brilliance. Therefore, he appeared like a very tall Ashoka tree related
to the Jina.  **Verse 15:**  Gautama Swami says that even if all people together
continuously describe him with thousands of tongues, the description cannot be
completed even in hundreds of years.  **Verse 16:**  Then, Indra, in the
presence of the Lokapalas and other pure-hearted gods seated on their respective
thrones, narrated this Purana.  **Verse 17-18:**  While narrating the Purana, he
said, "Oh gods! You should continuously worship those supreme Arhant Bhagavans
with flowers of devotion, who have destroyed this world, which is like a great
demon, very difficult to conquer, destroyer of happiness, and a great enemy,
with the wheel of knowledge, and who are like fire to burn all the forests of
vices."  **Verse 19-21:**  Those who are capable of rescuing the noble beings
from the ocean of the world, which is filled with waves of passions and
crocodiles of desires, and whose birth is celebrated by Indra and the gods with
a grand abhisheka on Mount Meru with the water of the ocean of milk. And those
who are devoted, focused on the goal of liberation, and accompanied by their
families, worship them with one-pointed devotion.  **Verse 22:**  He who exists,
having abandoned the earth, which is like a woman whose breasts are the Vindhya
and Kailash mountains and whose waist is the ocean waves, and having taken the
woman of liberation.  **Verse 23:**  He who, having come from the front of
heaven, brought light to this world, which was covered in the darkness of great
delusion, devoid of dharma, and without a master.  **Verse 24:**  Just as a lion
destroys elephants, those who possess extraordinary power, destroyed the eight
enemies of karma in a moment.

Maheshvara, Sadharma Chakravarti, Vibhu, Tirthankara, Kriti, Sansarasudan, Suri,
Gyanachakshu and Bhavantaka, etc. are the names by which the wise praise him.
||25-27|| The kings of men and the kings of gods praise him with pure words that
contain both hidden and revealed meanings, with great devotion. ||28|| By his
grace, beings who are free from karma reside in the three worlds, existing in
their own nature. ||29|| His greatness, even when remembered, destroys sin, and
his supreme divine Purana is the cause of joy. ||30|| O devotees of the gods,
who are eager for self-welfare, be always devoted to that Maha Kalyan, the root,
the Devadhideva, Jinendra Bhagavan. ||31|| In this endless cycle of birth and
death, a being, driven by his own karma, rarely attains the human state, but
alas, even then he gets lost in delusion. ||32|| How can those who hate the
'Ant' (the ultimate reality) attain the Ratna Tray (the three jewels) again in
this vast ocean of the world, filled with the great whirlpools of the four
paths? ||33|| He who, having attained the human state with great difficulty,
remains devoid of the Ratna Tray, wanders like the wheel of a chariot, due to
his own sinful nature. ||34|| Alas, in this human world, how many people, even
those who follow the path of the past, do not respect Jinendra Bhagavan, the
destroyer of the enemy of the world! ||35|| This being, performing false
austerities, becomes a god with little wealth, and when he falls from there and
attains the human state, he still, alas, acts treacherously. ||36|| This being,
dominated by great delusion, is attached to false dharma and does not attain the
supreme, Jinendra Bhagavan, the king of even the great Indra. ||37|| This
creature, whose soul is attracted to the flesh of the senses, having attained
the human state, is deluded by the deluding karma, which is a great misfortune.
||38|| Even if a false ascetic, by the force of evil karma, attains heaven, he
remains tormented with anxiety, knowing his own inferiority. ||39|| There, he
thinks, "Alas! In this beautiful place, like the Ratna Dweep, what good have I
done for myself by following this path?" ||40||

## Chapter Fourteen Hundred and Fourteen  Alas! Alas! How unfortunate I am! I, a
fool, have been led astray by the group of false scriptures and the eloquent,
sinful, arrogant, and fallen men.    Having attained the human birth, this
excellent Jain doctrine remains elusive for the unfortunate and constantly
suffering beings.   Even for a great god who has fallen from heaven, attaining
the three jewels taught by the Jinas is rare. What then can be said of other
beings?  Blessed and favored is the one who, having attained the human birth,
the best of all births, works for the welfare of his soul and attains the
eternal three jewels.  Vibhāvasu, the best of the gods, said to himself, "When
will I attain the human birth, which is the essence of existence?"  "When will I
abandon the enemy of the senses, control my mind, destroy my karma, and attain
the Jina-related path of liberation through austerity?"  One of the gods said,
"This is the thought of a being who is still in heaven. When we all attain the
human birth, we forget all such thoughts."  "If you don't believe this, why
don't you go and see Rama and Balabhadra, who have fallen from the Brahma-loka
and are endowed with human power?"  The mighty Indra himself replied, "Of all
bonds, the bond of affection is the strongest."  "A being bound by chains on his
hands, feet, and other limbs can be liberated, but how can a being bound by the
chains of affection be liberated?"  "A man bound by chains can travel thousands
of yojanas, but a man bound by affection cannot even move an inch."  "Lakshmana
is always devoted to Rama. He is never satisfied with seeing him and is willing
to give his life to serve him."  "How can he abandon Lakshmana, the benefactor,
even for a moment, when his mind is restless at the thought of his absence?"

## Padma Purana **Chanda:** (?) Even the wise, due to the extraordinary nature
of karma, fall into delusion. Otherwise, who, having heard all about their own
future, would not act for their own benefit, being conscious? ||54|| Thus, O
Gods! What more can be said about beings? It is certain that one should strive
with a pure heart to destroy the enemy, the world. ||55||  **Malini Chanda:**
Thus, having attained the path of the gods, the path of truth, and being
completely purified by the association of the qualities of the Jina, the
beautiful path shown by Indra, became pleasing. The sun, moon, and Kalpavasis,
having attained pure minds, achieved freedom from the fear of the world,
desiring to attain the human state. ||56||  Thus ends the 114th chapter of the
Padma Purana, known as the "Shankatha of the Gods," composed by Acharya
Ravishena, which narrates the story of Indra and the gods. ||114||

The Fifteenth Hundred Chapter  Then, after leaving the seat, the gods and
demons, bowing to Indra, went to their respective places, carrying the intense
emotions. ||1||  Two of the gods, driven by curiosity, decided to test the love
of Padmanarayana, being lovers of play and united by mutual love. They said,
"Let us see the affection of these two." ||2-3||  He who cannot bear even a
day's absence, what will that Hari do upon hearing the news of his elder
brother's death? Seeing the grief-stricken Narayana, let us make fun for a
moment. Let us go to the city of Kosala. ||4-5||  What will be the face of
Vishnu, overwhelmed with grief? At whom will he be angry? Where will he go? What
will he say? ||6||  Having made this plan, the two wicked gods, Ratnachula and
Mrigachula by name, went to the city of Ayodhya. ||7||  They caused the sound of
weeping of all the women of the inner palace by divine magic in Padmabhavana,
and made the gatekeepers, friends, ministers, priests, and other men in front,
go to Lakshmana with downcast faces and announce the death of Rama. They said,
"O Lord! Rama is dead." Hearing this, the eyes of Lakshmana, trembling with a
soft breeze, became like the petals of a blue lotus. ||8-10||  "Alas, what has
happened?" He had uttered half of this word when his mind became empty and he
shed tears. ||11||  As if struck by lightning, he leaned against a golden pillar
and sat on the throne, motionless like a clay doll. ||12||  His eyes were not
closed, yet his body remained motionless. He was then assuming the form of a
living man whose mind was elsewhere. ||13||  Seeing Lakshmana, who was struck by
the fire of his brother's death, lifeless, the two gods were greatly distressed.

Jain Terms Preserved:  In the Panchapurana, it is certainly the fifteenth death
according to the divine plan. Filled with sorrow and wonder, the Saudharma and
Aruci deities departed. (15)  Thereafter, their minds were completely engulfed
by the flames of remorse. The two, who were condemned, never attained peace
there. (16)   The sinful deeds of the ungrateful and deluded souls become the
cause of their own suffering. (17)  Realizing that the deed was divinely
ordained, the noble ladies endeavored to appease him. (18)  By what ungrateful
and deluded lady was he disgraced, she who was filled with the pride of good
fortune and extremely perverse? (19)  Be gracious, let the anger subside, or
even this painful seat (of suffering). Wherever there is anger, that is
considered the right course of action. (20)  Saying this, some embraced him with
the ground of supreme love, and fell at his feet, intent on sweet speech. (21)
Some played the vina, singing most sweetly, with the intention of pleasing him.
(22)  Some, eager to converse with him, made efforts from the entire assembly to
address him. (23)  Some, in their pristine charm, embraced and kissed the cheek
adorned with earrings of their beloved. (24)  Some, with lotus-petal-like faces,
reverently placed his lotus-like feet on their heads. (25)  Some, with deer-like
eyes of a child, were eager to adorn his head with the garland of intoxicated
lotus flowers. (26)  Some, with wide-open mouths, slowly nibbled on his limbs,
making sounds in all the joints. (27)  Thus, the futile efforts of these noble
ladies, devoid of consciousness, came to naught. (28)

Chapter One Hundred and Fifteen  Those seventeen thousand women of Hari were
adorned with the beauty of a lotus garden, gently swayed by a soft breeze.
||26||  When the Lord remained in that state, doubt entered the anxious minds of
the women, who had come with great difficulty. ||30||  They, the innocent ones,
touched him, entangled in delusion, thinking in their hearts, "Perhaps we have
harbored some ill-will towards him, spoken some inappropriate words, or
entertained some feeling that is painful to hear." ||31||  Those women, who
possessed the grace and brilliance of a group of celestial nymphs, were so
consumed by grief at that time that their beauty vanished. ||32||  Having heard
this news from the palace guards, Rama, surrounded by his ministers, arrived
there in a state of panic. ||33||  Then, surrounded by his most trusted
advisors, he entered the inner palace, his steps hurried and scattered, as he
was overwhelmed with anxiety. ||34||  He then saw Lakshmana's face, which had
lost its radiant glow and was now pale like the morning moon. ||35||  It was not
as well-composed as before, completely corrupted by nature, and resembling a
lotus that had been uprooted at that very moment. ||36||  He pondered, "What
could be the reason that Lakshmana is aloof and sorrowful today, with his head
bowed slightly?" ||37||  Approaching him with affection, Rama repeatedly sniffed
his head and embraced him, who was shaped like a tree afflicted by frost. ||38||
Although Rama saw the signs of a deceased person all around, filled with love,
he considered him to be immortal, like nectar. ||39||  His body was bent, his
neck was crooked, his arms were loose, and his body, breathing, contraction of
limbs, blinking of eyes, etc. were all signs of a dying man. ||40||  Lakshmana
had fallen into a state of meaninglessness. ||28||  Gautama Swami says that at
that time, Lakshmana's seventeen thousand wives were adorned with the beauty of
a lotus garden, gently swayed by a soft breeze. ||29||  Then, when Lakshmana
remained in that state, doubt entered the anxious minds of the women, who had

Padmapurana 1 Seeing Lakshmana thus freed from his own body, Rama, overwhelmed
by anxiety and intense fear, was drenched in sweat. ||41|| His face was
extremely dejected, he fainted repeatedly, and his eyes were filled with tears.
Rama was looking at his limbs from all sides. ||42|| He was saying, "In this
body, there is not even a scratch as big as a fingernail, then how did he attain
this state? - Who caused this condition?" ||43|| Thinking this, Rama's body
started trembling and his soul was filled with sorrow. Although he was a scholar
himself, he quickly called for those who knew about this matter. ||44|| When all
the physicians, skilled in mantras and medicines, who were masters of their art,
examined him and gave their verdict, Rama, filled with despair, fainted and fell
to the ground like a uprooted tree. ||45-46|| With great difficulty, he was
revived from his faint by sandalwood-mixed water and the wind favorable to the
Talavrinta tree. Then, in great distress, he started wailing. ||47|| As Rama was
afflicted by sorrow and grief, he was also experiencing pain. Therefore, he was
shedding a stream of tears that covered his face. ||48|| At that time, Rama's
face, covered with tears, looked like the moon adorned with rare clouds. ||49||
Seeing Rama in such a state, his heart filled with extreme sorrow, the palace,
like a vast ocean, was overwhelmed with grief. ||50|| The noble women, submerged
in the ocean of sorrow, with their bodies withered, filled the earth and sky
with their excessive tears and cries. ||51|| They were saying, "Oh Lord! Oh Joy
of the World! Oh Most Beautiful Life! Speak to us, your beloved ones. Where are
you? Why did you leave?" ||52|| "Why are you leaving us without any fault on our
part? Even if there is a fault, it does not stay in a person for long." ||53||
Hearing this news, Lavana and Ankusha, overwhelmed by extreme sorrow, were
filled with anxiety. ||54|| 372 He had become devoid of all movements. ||40||

## Chapter One Hundred and Fifteen  **Alas, this human existence is worthless!**
There is no greater disgrace. Death attacks it in the blink of an eye, without
warning. ||54-55||  Even Narayana, who could not be subdued by gods and
celestial beings, was brought under the control of the noose of time. ||56||
**What need do we have for this perishable body and perishable wealth?**
Thinking thus, both sons of Sita attained enlightenment. ||57||  Fearing the
prospect of returning to the womb, both heroes, bowing to their father's feet,
boarded a palanquin and went to the garden called Mahendrodya. ||58||  There,
they took refuge in the Muni Raja named Amritasvara and became great ascetics.
||59||  When the noble-minded Lavana and Ankusha were taking initiation, their
minds, like clay balls, were filled with disrespect towards the vast earth.
||60||  On one hand, the separation from his sons, and on the other, the grief
of his brother's death - Rama was caught in a whirlpool of sorrow. ||61||
Gautama Swami says that Lakshmana was dearer to Rama than his kingdom, his sons,
his wife, and even his own life. ||62||  People in the world have different
kinds of hearts. Therefore, when their loved ones reach such an undesirable
state due to the force of karma, some are consumed by sorrow, while others
attain detachment. ||63||  When the time comes, and the inner cause of the
ripening of one's own actions manifests, the sun of enlightenment rises for
beings, who, upon finding an external cause in any object, develop detachment.
||64||  Thus ends the one hundred and fifteenth chapter of the Padma Purana,
composed by the Acharya Ravishena, known as the Parsvanatha, which describes the
death of Lakshmana and the penance of Lavana and Ankusha. ||115||  1.
*Pashyataam* (should be *Pashyata*) 2.  *Dayitato'sya* (should be
*Dayito'to'sya*) 3.  *Sa (nih) Shokam Vairagayam* (should be *Sa Shokam
Vairagayam* or *Sa N Shokam Vairagayam Cha*)

## The Sixteenth Hundred Chapter  When the time for Dharma arrived, O King
Lakshmana, the world was left in turmoil by Rama, the leader of the age. ||1||
Rama's body, soft in form and fragrant by nature, though lifeless, was not
abandoned by him. ||2||  He embraced it, held it in his lap, wiped it, smelled
it, kissed it, and sat with it in his arms with great longing. ||3||  He could
not find solace even for a moment in its release. Just as a child considers the
nectar fruit to be his greatest treasure, so too did he consider that dead body
to be his greatest treasure. ||4||  He cried out, "Alas, brother! Was this
right? Why did you decide to leave me alone?" ||5||  "Do you not know that I
cannot bear your separation? Why do you want to leave me in this fire of
sorrow?" ||6||  "Alas, father! Why did you choose to do this cruel act? Why did
you leave for the other world without consulting me?" ||7||  "O son! Grant me
the nectar of your reply quickly. You were always so polite, why are you angry
with me without any fault?" ||8||  "O beautiful one! You never held me in high
regard, why have you become different now? Tell me, what have I done?" ||9||
"In the past, when you saw Rama from afar, you would stand up respectfully and
place him on the throne, while you yourself would sit on the ground." ||10||  "O
Lakshmana! Your feet, adorned with beautiful nails like the moon, are placed on
my head, yet you are still angry. Why don't you forgive me?" ||11||  "O God!
Rise quickly, my sons have gone to the forest. Let us bring them back before
they go too far." ||12||  These women, consumed by your virtues, are rolling on
the ground, making mournful sounds like cuckoos, bereft of you. ||13||  The
garlands, jewels, belts, and earrings have fallen down. Why don't you stop this
sorrowful sight? ||14||  Then, Gautam Swami says, "O King! When Lakshmana met
his end, Rama, the leader of the age, left this troubled world." ||1||

**Chapter Sixteen Hundred and Sixteen**  375  What shall I do, and where shall I
go, now that I am bereft of you? I do not see a place where I can find solace.
||15||  I see your face, which I could never tire of looking at, even now. Was
it right for you to leave me, filled with such affection? ||16||  This is an
unprecedented sorrow for me, with the death of my brother. The fire of grief is
burning me, what can I do, I am so unfortunate? ||17||  Neither fire burns nor
poison dries up the body like the death of a brother, which is beyond
comparison. ||18||  Oh Lakshmana!  Suppress your anger now. This is the time for
the departure of the great sages, who have renounced their homes. ||19||  See,
the sun is setting, and the lotuses in the ponds are like your eyes, closed in
sleep. ||20||  Saying this, Rama, freed from other tasks, quickly made a bed and
lay down, embracing Lakshmana. ||21||  They say, "O God! I am alone now. Tell me
your thoughts, so that I may hear them, and know why you are in this state."
||22||  Your face, beautiful like the bright moon, is now devoid of radiance.
Why is this? ||23||  Your eyes were like tender leaves trembling in a gentle
breeze. Why are they now dull? ||24||  Tell me, what do you desire? I will
fulfill it all. O Vishnu! Do not appear like this, speak with your mouth, engage
in conversation. ||25||  Do you remember Sita, who was your companion in joy and
sorrow? But that virtuous lady has gone to the other world. Are you grieving
because of this? ||26||  O Lord of Lakshmi! Abandon your sorrow. See, a group of
Vidyadharas, hostile and intent on attack, have arrived and are entering
Ayodhya. ||27||  O Beautiful One! Never before has your face looked like this,
even in anger. Why is it so now? O Son! Abandon this hostile demeanor. ||28||
1. Vaimukhyam, meaning death.  2. Vishannaasi, meaning you are sorrowful. 3.
Vidyadharasamooha, meaning a group of Vidyadharas.

I bow to your feet, which are renowned for their dance and previous deeds. You
are known throughout the world for being favorable to me. ||26||  You are the
unparalleled light, the great lamp of the world, but you have been extinguished
by the strong wind of time. ||30||  You had attained the position of King of
Kings and brought great celebration to the world. How can you leave it orphaned?
||31||  You conquered the entire army of your enemies with your wheel of dharma.
Why do you now endure the defeat of the wheel of time? ||32||  Your beautiful
body, which was once adorned with royal fortune, still shines even now, though
it is lifeless. ||33||  O King of Kings, wake up, abandon sleep, the night has
passed, this evening is announcing the rising of the sun. ||34||  Eternal good
morning to the Jinas, the observers of all worlds, and to the Muni Suvrata, the
refuge of all auspicious beings. ||35||  I know this dawn as the ultimate
darkness, for I see your face without any movement. ||36||  O wise one, rise, do
not sleep for long, abandon sleep, go to the assembly hall, sit there to receive
the homage of your ministers. ||37||  See, this Kamalaakar, filled with sorrow,
has reached the state of wakefulness, but why are you, being wise, still
indulging in sleep? ||38||  You have never done such a contrary act before,
therefore rise and be attentive to your royal duties. ||39||  Brother, because
of your long sleep, the proper activities are not being performed in the Jina
temples, such as beautiful music and auspicious sounds of drums. ||40||  Because
of your state, the morning duties of the compassionate monks have become slack,
and they are experiencing great anxiety about their lord. ||41||  This city,
saddened by your absence, does not shine, devoid of the sounds of the vina,
flute, and mridanga. ||42||

377 The 116th Parva Arya Chanda It seems that my past karma, which was
accumulated earlier, has come to fruition. I have been afflicted by the sorrow
of separation from my brother. Oh Lord, this is a great hardship! ||43|| Just as
you, O Sun of Mankind, brought joy to me, who was filled with sorrow, during the
previous battle, so too, rise now and bring joy to me, who am deeply distressed.
||44|| Thus ends the 116th Parva of the Padma Purana, composed by Acharya
Ravishena, known as the "Sri Ramadeva Vipralapa," which narrates the
lamentations of Sri Ramadeva. ||116|| Jain Education International 85-3

The Seventeenth Chapter  Then all the Vidhyadhara kings, having known the news,
arrived in Ayodhya with their wives. || 1 || Vibhishana, along with his sons,
Chandrodara, the son of the king, Sugriva, and Sasivardhana, all arrived with
their retinues. || 2 || Their eyes were filled with tears, and their minds were
disturbed. They entered the palace of Padmanabha, with folded hands and bowed
heads. || 3 || Filled with sorrow, they performed the proper rites, sat down on
the ground in front of Rama, and after remaining silent for a while, they slowly
spoke these words: "O Lord, although this sorrow, born from the loss of a
beloved one, is difficult to bear, yet you are the knower of all things, and
therefore you should be able to overcome this sorrow." || 4-5 || Having spoken
thus, and while they were still silent, Vibhishana, who was wise in the nature
of the ultimate truth and the worldly affairs, spoke these words: "O King, this
state of existence is without beginning and end. This is not the first time that
such a thing has happened in the world." || 6-7 || "In this cage of the world,
whoever is born must die. Even with various means, death cannot be avoided." ||
8 || "When this body is certainly perishable, then it is futile to seek solace
in it. In reality, those who are wise in their own interests, engage in the
means of self-benefit." || 9 || "O King, no one who has gone to the other world
responds to our cries. Therefore, you should not grieve." || 10 || "From the
union of man and woman, the bodies of beings are born, and they perish like
bubbles of water." || 11 || "Even the Indras, along with the Lokapalas, are
subject to falling from heaven when their karmic bodies are destroyed due to the
depletion of their merit." || 12 || "In this body of a mortal, which is filled
with the pains of the womb, afflicted with diseases, as unstable as a drop of
water on a blade of grass, and a mere collection of flesh and bones, what is
there to cherish?" || 13 || "Why does one grieve for the dead, thinking of
oneself as immortal? Why does one not grieve for oneself, which is caught in the
jaws of death?" || 14 ||

Chapter Seventeen Hundred and Seventeen  Why grieve for an individual? Why not
grieve for yourself, who is destined to suffer in the midst of the cycle of
birth and death? ||14||  If the death of only one were to occur, then it would
be appropriate to cry out loud. But when this defeat related to death is equally
obtained by all, then there is no need to cry. ||15||  At the time this being is
born, death immediately surrounds it. In this way, when death is a common dharma
for all, why is there grief? ||16||  Just as a deer, tormented by a hunter in
the forest, grieves for its lost hair, so too does this being, longing for the
union of desired objects, grieve in vain. ||17||  When we all must depart from
here, separated, why is there grief at their departure in the first place?
||18||  Look at the courage of this being, who sits fearlessly before the lion,
like a deer before the wielder of the thunderbolt, Yama. ||19||  Have you heard
of anyone else, in the netherworld or on the earth, who has escaped the grip of
death, besides the one who is the Lord of the world? ||20||  Just as the
fragrant forest of the Vindhya mountains is consumed by fire, so too is this
world, caught in the cycle of existence, consumed by the fire of time. Do you
not see this? ||21||  Wandering through the forest of existence, and becoming
subject to desire, these beings, like intoxicated elephants, fall under the
control of the noose of time. ||22||  Even though this being attains heaven,
having reached the path of dharma, it is still cast down like a tree on the bank
of a river, due to its impermanence. ||23||  Just as fires are extinguished by
the clouds of a deluge, so too have countless groups of kings and gods been
destroyed by the cloud of time. ||24||  Even flying far into the sky and going
far into the netherworld, I have not seen a place that is beyond the reach of
death. ||25||  At the end of the sixth kalpa, all of Bharatavarsha is destroyed,
and even the great mountains are shattered. What then can be said of the human
body? ||26||  Those who were endowed with bodies of vajra, and whom even the
gods and demons could not kill, have also attained impermanence. What then of
humans, who are as ephemeral as the inner part of a banana? ||27||

Padmapurane As a mother embraces her child, so does death take away the embodied
being. Just as a snake drags out a snake from the nether regions, so does death
take away the living being. ||28|| Alas, O dear brother, dear son! Thus wailing
in great distress, the world-tortured frog is being swallowed by the terrible
serpent of time. ||29|| "I am doing this, I will do that" - with such an evil-
minded attitude, the person enters the dreadful mouth of Yama, like a ship
entering the ocean. ||30|| If a person follows the one who has gone to another
existence, then there will never be separation from the desired and the
undesired. ||31|| One who, out of pride, shows affection towards others, that
human-elephant surely enters the fire of suffering. ||32|| The multitudes of
kinsmen that have come to the transmigratory existence of those who drink the
nectar of existence, are not even equal to the grains of sand in the ocean.
||33|| The one who was pampered elsewhere with various acts of affection, the
same one, having attained the status of an enemy, is killed by that very one
with great fury. ||34|| Fie on this world where the flesh of the one whose
breasts were suckled in another life, is eaten, the one who was earlier
worshipped as the master by bowing the head. ||35|| Behold the power of this
delusion by which the being, being subjugated, seeks union like a hand seeking a
great serpent. ||37|| There is not even a tiny space in the universe where the
living being, having arrived, does not experience death or birth. ||38||
Whatever molten copper and other impurities the being has drunk in the hells,
there is not even that much water in the self-existent ocean. ||39|| The being
who, endowed with the boar-form, has been made to eat the excrement - I think he
is far beyond even thousands of Vindhyas. ||40|| The mass of heads severed by
mutual destruction, if it were to block the path of the luminaries, then...

The One Hundred and Seventeenth Chapter, entitled "Lakshmana's Separation and
Vibhishana's Description of the State of the World," from the Padma Purana, as
narrated by Acharya Sri Ravishena, is complete.  This chapter describes how
Vibhishana, a wise being with the brilliance of the sun among the celestial
beings, tried to convince Rama to abandon his sorrow over Lakshmana's death.
Vibhishana explained that clinging to the body, which is filled with kshaya
(negative emotions) and chinta (worry), is futile. He argued that the body is
merely a burden and that it is better to abandon it and move on. However, Rama,
like a devoted disciple, refused to abandon Lakshmana's body, just as a disciple
would not disobey their guru's command.  The chapter also highlights the
suffering of beings in hell and the folly of clinging to worldly pleasures. It
emphasizes the importance of detaching oneself from the cycle of birth and death
and seeking liberation.  The chapter concludes with a reminder that even a wise
being like Vibhishana, who could transcend the limitations of the physical
world, could not convince Rama to abandon his attachment to Lakshmana's body.
This underscores the power of attachment and the difficulty of overcoming it.

Chapter One Hundred and Eighteen  Then, the kings, beginning with Sugriva, said
to the god, "We will build a pyre, and on it we will perform the rites for the
king's body." [1]  Angered, Rama replied, "Let you all burn on the pyre, along
with your mothers, fathers, and grandfathers." [2]  "Or, if any of you have a
friend with a wicked mind, then you should all go to death quickly with him."
[3]  "Rise, rise, let us go to another place, Lakshmana. Let us not hear such
harsh words from these wicked ones." [4]  Having said this, they quickly moved
to lift the body of their brother. The kings, in confusion, supported him by his
back and shoulders. [5]  Rama, not trusting them, took Lakshmana himself and
went to another place, like a child carrying a poisonous fruit. [6]  There, with
tears in his eyes, he said, "Brother, why do you sleep so long? Rise, the time
has come to go to the bathing place." [7]  Having said this, he placed the dead
Lakshmana on a bathing platform, with all its accessories. Then, in great grief,
he poured water from a golden pitcher over him for a long time. [8]  After
adorning him with all his ornaments, including his crown, he quickly ordered the
servants of the food-house, "Bring various jewel-encrusted and golden vessels,
and fill them with the finest food." [9-10]  "Bring the best and purest wine,
and prepare various delicious dishes filled with flavors." [11]  Having received
these orders, the servants, who always obeyed their master's wishes,
respectfully brought all the things. [12]  Then, Rama placed a morsel of food in
Lakshmana's mouth. But it did not enter, just as the words of the Jina did not
enter the ears of the Abhavy. [13]  1. Dish. 2. Lakshmana's + inside + mouth,
this is the division.

## Chapter One Hundred and Eighteen  Then, if you have anger towards me, O God,
then what has this ambrosia-like food spoiled here? ||14||  This, O Lakshmi-
Dhar, is your favorite, the best wine. Drink this, placed in a cup adorned with
blooming lotuses. ||15||  Saying this, he placed it in his mouth with great
respect. How could that beautiful wine enter there, in the unconscious mouth?
||16||  Thus, with a heart filled with affection and devoid of detachment, Rama
performed all these actions as if Lakshmana were alive. ||17||  Although
Lakshmana was lifeless, Rama played beautiful music for him, accompanied by the
sounds of the vina, flute, etc. ||18||  Then, with great desire, he lifted
Lakshmana, whose body was anointed with sandalwood, with both arms, placed him
in his lap, and kissed his forehead, cheek, and hand repeatedly. ||19||  He said
to him, "O Lakshmana, what has happened to you that you do not leave sleep? Tell
me once." ||20||  Thus, while Rama, afflicted by the demon of affection, was
engaged in this activity, the rise of the karma, born of great delusion and
attachment, arrived. ||21||  Knowing this news, the enemies, like dark clouds
roaring to cover the sun, the ultimate brilliance, were filled with anger.
||22||  With a heart filled with animosity and great anger, the enemies, led by
Charuratna, the son of Sunda, the brother of Shambuka, went to Vanamali, the son
of Indrajit. ||23||  Charuratna, inciting him, said, "Lakshmana, having killed
our uncle and both of us, has established Viradhit on the throne of the Patal
Lanka kingdom." ||24||  Then, having found Sugriva, the moon-like and brotherly
benefactor, to gladden the army of the Vanaras, Rama, afflicted by separation,
received news of his wife Sita. ||25||  Then, desiring to conquer Lanka, Rama,
with the Vidyadharas, crossed the ocean in aerial chariots. ||26||

384 Padma Purana Rama and Lakshmana obtained the Vidya (knowledge) called
Singhavahani and Garuda Vahini. Due to their influence, they captured Indrajit
and others. ||27|| The same Lakshmana who had killed Ravana by obtaining the
Chakra Ratna, has now been killed by the wheel of time. ||28|| The monkey
warriors were intoxicated by the shade of his arms, but now, with their wings
clipped, they have become fit for the ultimate attack. ||29|| Today is the
twelfth day of mourning for Raghava. He carries the dead body of Lakshmana, and
what other kind of delusion can be upon him? ||30|| Although he is unparalleled,
the destroyer of weapons like the Hal and Musala, yet he is vulnerable to attack
because he is trapped in the mire of grief. ||31|| We fear only him, and no one
else, because his younger brother Lakshmana has destroyed all the connections of
our lineage. ||32|| Then, Indrajit's son, Vanamali, hearing of the calamity that
had befallen his vast lineage, became agitated and blazed forth with the
renowned path, that is, he flared up with the renowned vigor of the Kshatriya
clan. ||33|| He commanded his ministers, gathered all the people for war by the
sound of the drums, and set out for Ayodhya with his son, Charuratna. ||34||
Those two, Vajramali and Charuratna, who were protected by the ocean of their
army and who were filled with anger towards Sugriva, were eager to provoke Rama.
||35|| Hearing that Vanamali had arrived with Charuratna, all the Vidyaadhara
kings came to Ramachandra. ||36|| At that time, Ayodhya was filled with
confusion, agitated on all sides, and trembled with fear, just as it had
trembled when Lavanasura had arrived. ||37|| Seeing the enemy army approaching,
Rama, who possessed unparalleled valor, carried the dead Lakshmana in his arms
and looked towards the great bow called Vavarta, which was steady in its nature
and crooked like the brow of Yama. ||38-39|| Meanwhile, in heaven, there was a
great tremor among the army of the god of death, Krtaantavaktra, and the
celestial bird Jatayu. ||40|| Many islands were destroyed. ||41||  Jain

## Chapter One Hundred and Eighteen  **Verse 41:** In the same chariot where
Jatayu, the supreme god, was born, the god Krtaanta also attained the same
glory.  **Verse 42:** Krtaanta, the god, said to Jatayu, "O king of gods, why
have you become so angry today?"  **Verse 43:** Jatayu, the knower of the
future, replied, "When I was in the Grdha state, the one who nurtured me like a
beloved son, is now facing a large enemy army, and he is grieving over the death
of his brother."  **Verse 44:** Then Krtaanta, the god, using his vision of the
future, spoke with great brilliance, his heart filled with sorrow and anger.
**Verse 45:** "Friend, it is true, he was also our beloved master. By his grace,
I performed many daring deeds on earth."  **Verse 46:** "He also told me to free
him from danger. Now that danger has befallen him, let us go to him quickly."
**Verse 47:** Saying this, the two gods, with their black hair and locks
swaying, their crowns shining brightly, and their ear ornaments sparkling, set
out from the celestial abode of Indra towards Ayodhya.  **Verse 48:** They were
both great and wise, skilled in destroying the enemy's forces.  **Verse 49:**
Krtaanta said to Jatayu, "You go and confuse the enemy army, make them lose
their minds, and I will go to protect Rama."  **Verse 50:** Then Jatayu, the
wise and generous, who could change his form at will, confused the enemy army
with his illusions.  **Verse 51:** As the enemies approached, thinking, "This is
Ayodhya," he showed them large mountains in front and behind, using his magic.
**Verse 52:** Then, standing near Ayodhya, he destroyed the entire army of the
enemy Vidyadharas, and filled both the earth and the sky with the city of
Ayodhya.  **Verse 53:** As a result, the entire land and sky became filled with
the city of Ayodhya, so much so that it seemed as if the entire world was
nothing but Ayodhya.  **Verse 54:** The enemy army, overwhelmed by this display
of power and grandeur, was completely defeated.

In the Padma Purana, **55.** The enemy army, seeing the earth and sky filled
with Ayodhyas, became devoid of pride and fell into distress. **55.** The
soldiers said to each other, "How can we sustain our lives, how can we stay
alive, in the presence of this extraordinary deity named Rama?" **56.** Where
did this power of transformation come from in the Vidyadharas? What have we
done, we who acted without thinking? **57.** Even many fireflies, though they
are opposed to the sun, what can they do to the sun whose thousands of rays
illuminate the entire world? **58.** O friend, even if we want to flee, there is
no way to escape, for this terrible army is spreading throughout the entire
world. **59.** There is no great benefit in death, for a living human being may,
by the ripening of his actions, attain good fortune. **60.** If we are destroyed
like bubbles by these waves of soldiers, what will we gain from it? **61.**
Thus, the entire army of Vidyadharas, engaged in mutual conversation and
trembling violently, became utterly distraught. **62.** Gautama Swami says, "O
King, after that, Jatayu, playing with his power of transformation, mercifully
gave those Vidyadhara enemies a path to flee towards the south." **63.** With
trembling hearts and shaking bodies, those Vidyadharas, like birds frightened by
a hawk, fled with great speed. **64.** What answer will we now give to
Vibhishana? What is our glory now, with our souls utterly humbled? **65.** What
radiance will we show to our own people? Where is our fortitude, or our desire
to live? **66.** Having decided thus, Vrajmali, the son of Indrajit, became
filled with shame. Seeing the power of the gods, he became detached from his own
power. **67.** As a result, he, along with Charuratna, the son of Sunda, and
other beloved ones, renounced anger and became a devotee of the sage Rativega.
**68.** To frighten Jatayu, the terrible god, with his thunderbolt, struck the
king who had been freed from his mortal body.

Chapter Eighteen Hundred and Eighteen  The Devata with a troubled mind, having
been bound by the law of karma, thought, "Oh, these great sages have attained
liberation."  ||66||  At that time, I, having blamed the pure-souled saints,
have suffered great pain in the animal realm and in hell. ||67||  Even now, I am
experiencing the consequences of that wicked enemy, but it is so small that I
will not be deluded again into the long ocean of existence. ||68-69||  Thus,
calming his mind, he introduced himself properly, bowed down with devotion, and
sought forgiveness from the sages. ||70||  Having done so, he went to Ayodhya,
where Rama, bewildered by the grief of his brother, was acting like a child.
||71||  There, he saw with great compassion that the Devata, Krtaantavaktra, was
watering a dry tree, having changed his form to teach Rama. ||72||  Seeing this,
the Devata, Jatayu, also placed a plow on the bodies of two dead oxen, took a
seed in his hand, and began to sow it on the stony ground. ||73||  After some
time, Krtaantavaktra began to churn a pot full of water in front of Rama, and
Jatayu began to pound sand in a mortar. ||74||  Thus, these two Devata performed
many other meaningless acts in front of Rama.  Then, Rama asked them in turn,
"Oh, fool! Why are you watering this dead tree? Why are you placing a plow on a
dead body? Why are you wasting seeds on stone? How will you get butter by
churning water? And, oh, child! Will oil be produced by pounding sand? In all
these actions, only labor remains, not even an atom of the desired fruit. Why
have you begun this useless effort?" ||75-78||  Then, in turn, the two Devata
said, "We also ask you a truthful question."

288 Panapurana Then, the god of the earth, whose mind was polluted, embraced
Lakshmana, who was the embodiment of auspiciousness, and said these words: "Why
do you criticize the best of men, Saumitri? Do you not see the fault in uttering
such inauspicious words?"  "As long as this dispute with the one who is the
harbinger of death continues, Jatayu has arrived carrying a dead human body."
Seeing him face to face, Rama asked, "Why are you carrying this dead body on
your shoulders, being entangled in delusion?" Jatayu replied, "You are wise, yet
you ask me this. Why don't you ask yourself why you are carrying a body devoid
of breath and blinking eyes?" "You quickly see even the smallest fault in
others, like the tip of a hair, but you don't see your own faults, which are as
big as Mount Meru." "We have great affection for you, as you are our king. It is
a saying that like attracts like." "You are the king chosen by all of us,
including myself, who are all wish-fulfilling demons." "We roam the entire earth
carrying the banner of the king of the mad, and we make the entire earth, which
is mad and hostile, favorable to us." Hearing these words, Rama's delusion
weakened, and remembering the words of his guru, he felt ashamed of his
foolishness. His mind, which was covered by the cloud-like darkness of delusion,
was now shining brightly with the rays of understanding. His mind, free from the
mud of delusion, was as clear as the autumn sky. His sorrow, which was dispelled
by the sweet words of his guru, which were like nectar, made him shine as
brightly as he had before when he was reunited with his sons. He, the best of
men, gained steadfastness through the words of his guru, just as Mount Meru
gains shade from the water of the Ganges. "Why are you carrying this lifeless
body in vain?"  Then, the god of the earth, whose mind was polluted, embraced

## Chapter One Hundred and Eighteen  **Verse 66:** Like a lotus petal freed from
the touch of a drying wind, his soul, pure and free from defilement, was filled
with joy.  **Verse 67:**  Lost in great darkness, he found the rising sun, like
a man starved, he found the food he desired.  **Verse 68:**  Parched with
thirst, he found a great lake, like a man suffering from a terrible disease, he
found a great medicine.  **Verse 69:**  Like a man seeking to cross the ocean,
he found a ship, like a man lost in a wrong path, he found the right way.
**Verse 100:**  Like a merchant seeking to reach his destination, he found a
great caravan, like a prisoner seeking freedom, his strong chains broke.
**Verse 101:**  Remembering the path of the Jinas, Padma-nabha was filled with
joy, his eyes like blooming lotuses, he radiated supreme radiance.  **Verse
102:**  He thought, "I have escaped from the depths of a dark well, or I have
reached another existence," and he embraced this thought.  **Verse 103:**
"Alas, like a drop of water clinging to the tip of a blade of grass, this human
life is fleeting, it is destroyed in an instant."  **Verse 104:**  "Wandering
through the four realms of existence, I have attained a human body with great
difficulty, why then am I a fool, why am I acting in vain?"  **Verse 105:**
"Whose are these beloved wives? Whose is this wealth and prosperity? Whose are
these relatives? These things are easily found in the world, but enlightenment
is extremely rare."  **Verse 106:**  Knowing that Rama was enlightened, the two
gods withdrew their illusions and manifested their divine powers, causing wonder
in the world.  **Verse 107:**  A unique wind, pleasant to touch and fragrant,
began to blow, and the sky was filled with beautiful chariots and flying
machines.  **Verse 108:**  Rama heard his own story, sung by celestial maidens,
accompanied by the sweet sound of the vina.  **Verse 109:**  In the meantime,
the god of death, Jataayu, asked Rama, "My lord, are these days filled with
happiness?"  **Verse 115:**  Such a great man, Rama, attained the same radiance
as the water of the Jina's birth ceremony.  **Verse 116:**  His soul was pure,
his intentions free from defilement, Rama was filled with joy like a lotus
forest free from the drying wind.  **Verse 117:**  He felt such joy as if a man
lost in great darkness had found the rising sun, or a man starved had found the
food he desired.  **Verse 118:**  Or like a man parched with thirst who found a
great lake, or a man suffering from a terrible disease who found a great
medicine.  **Verse 119:**  Or like a man seeking to cross the ocean who found a
ship, or a man lost in a wrong path who found the right way.  **Verse 120:**  Or
like a merchant seeking to reach his destination who found a great caravan, or a
prisoner seeking freedom whose strong chains broke.

In the Padma Purana, The king asked, "O Lord, have these days passed happily for
you?" Upon the gods asking this, King Ramachandra replied, "Why do you ask about
my happiness? All happiness is attained by those who have attained the state of
a muni." [106-110] I ask you, who are you both, with such gentle appearances?
And for what reason have you done this deed? [111] Then the divine being of
Jatayu said, "O King! You know, when I was a vulture in the forest and attained
peace from the sight of the muni." [112] There, you nurtured me with your
brother Lakshmana and the goddess Sita. Sita was abducted, and I was going to
stop her abduction, so I was killed by Ravana. [113] O Lord! At that time,
overwhelmed with grief, you made me chant the Pancha Namaskara mantra, which is
connected to the five supreme beings. [114] I am that Jatayu, by your grace, I
was born in heaven, abandoning that kind of suffering related to the cycle of
birth and death. [115] O Guru! Blinded by the great happiness of the gods, I,
the ignorant one, did not know that such a calamity had befallen you. [116] O
God! When your calamity ended, your karma-udaya made me aware of this and I have
come to do some retribution. [117] Then the divine being of Krtaantavaktra,
wearing a somewhat good attire, said, "O Lord! I was your Krtaantavaktra
commander." [118] You said, "Remember me in times of trouble." So, O Master! I
have come to you, having understood your command. [119] At that time, seeing
that wealth of the gods, the people who enjoyed worldly pleasures were filled
with utmost wonder and became pure of heart. [120] Then Rama said to the
commander Krtaantavaktra and the divine being of Jatayu, the lord of the gods,
"Oh, virtuous men! You both are the saviors of the afflicted beings." [121]
Look, you both, endowed with great power and possessing a very pure heart, have
come here from heaven to enlighten me. [122] Thus, having conversed with them
both, Rama, freed from the distress of grief, performed the funeral rites of
Lakshmana on the banks of the Sarayu river. [123] 1. Madodara - M. 2.

The One Hundred and Eighteenth Chapter 361 With a heart full of detachment and
free from sorrow, Rama, the protector of Dharma-Maryada, spoke these words to
Shatrughna:  ||12|| "O Shatrughna! You rule the kingdom of mortals. I, with my
mind and soul free from all desires, will enter the forest to worship the path
of liberation." ||125|| Shatrughna replied, "O Lord! I am not greedy for
pleasures due to attachment. My mind is fixed on the kingdom of unfettered
samadhi. I will attain that same kingdom of unfettered samadhi along with you.
There is no other path for me." ||126|| "O Sun of Men! In this world, who has
found satisfaction in captivating sensual pleasures, in friends, relatives,
brothers, desired objects, and even in their own life?" ||127|| Thus ends the
One Hundred and Eighteenth Chapter, named "Lakshmana-Samskara-Karanam," in the
Padma Purana, composed by Sri Ravishena Acharya, known as the "Kalyana Mitra
Deva." ||118||

The twenty-first chapter. Having heard his words, which were extremely
beneficial and certain, Rama pondered for a moment, considering all his duties.
||1|| Seeing Ananglavana's son sitting there, he bestowed upon him the position
of king with supreme power. ||2|| Ananglavana, who was equal to his father in
qualities and actions, and who was bowed to by all the chieftains, became the
bearer of the family's burden. ||3|| Ananglavana, who was supremely established,
full of love and prowess, attained all the auspiciousness of the earth, just as
victory does. ||4|| Vibhishana gave the kingdom of Lanka to his son, Subhushan,
and Sugriva also gave his kingdom to Angada's son. ||5|| Then, Dasharatha's son
Rama, seeing the kingdom like poisoned food or a wicked wife, abandoned it, just
as Bharata had done before. ||6|| He chose the one path of liberation, which was
worshipped by gods and demons, cherished by the sage-aspirants, and
characterized by the emergence of the quality of impartiality. ||7||  Frightened
by birth and death, and bearing the stain of karma, Rama embraced the path
prescribed by the sage Suvrata. ||8|| Having attained enlightenment, Kakutstha,
free from the afflictions of existence, shone brightly, like the sun emerging
from the clouds. ||9|| Then, a wealthy merchant named Arhadasa came to see him.
Sitting in the assembly, Rama inquired about the well-being of the entire
community of monks. ||10|| The merchant replied, "O King, because of your
suffering, even the monks on earth have experienced great sorrow." ||11|| At
that moment, the sky-faring sage Suvrata, the bearer of the lineage of the sage
Suvrata, who was the embodiment of detachment, came to know of Rama's situation
and arrived there. ||12||

The One Hundred and Nineteenth Chapter  37. Hearing this, Sri Rama, with great
joy and his hair standing on end, his eyes wide open, went to the sage. ||13||
11. Just as Vijay Balabhadra had gone to the sage Swarna Kumbha, so too, Sri
Rama, served by the kings of the Bhu-khecharas and the Vidyadharas, and a bearer
of great fortune, arrived with great devotion. ||11||  15. He bowed his head in
reverence, offering salutations to the sage, who was worshipped by thousands of
learned scholars. ||15||  16. Seeing that great soul, the cause of liberation,
Rama felt as if he had been immersed in the ocean of nectar. ||16||  17. Filled
with faith, he praised the supreme glory of the sage, just as the great king
Mahapadma had praised the sage Suvrata. ||17||  18. The Vidyadharas, who were
eager to serve in every way, adorned the place with flags, arches, offerings,
and music. ||18||  19. After the night had passed and the sun had risen, Rama
bowed to the sages and requested the Nirgrantha initiation. ||19||  20. He said,
"O Yogindra! I am eager to live according to the Dharma, with all my sins
removed and free from attachment and aversion, by your grace." ||20||  21. The
head of the order of monks replied, "O King! You have thought well. What is the
use of this perishable world?" ||21||  22. "It is indeed excellent to seek
refuge in the Jina Dharma, which bestows eternal, unobstructed, and supreme
happiness." ||22||  23. Hearing these words, Rama, who was detached from worldly
things, circumambulated the sage, just as the sun circles Mount Meru. ||23||
24. Sri Rama, who had attained great enlightenment, who wore the armor of great
compassion, and who was determined to destroy his karma with great patience,
cast off the fetters of desire, burned the cage of attachment, broke the chains
of greed, and shattered the pride of delusion. ||24||

334 Padmapurana Ahar, Kundala, Mauli, Ambara, and also Paramartha-apita-svanta-
tanu-lagn-mala-avali. ||26|| With white lotus-like tender fingers, Kakutstha
plucked out the hair from his head. ||27|| Rama, who had renounced all
possessions, shone brightly. He was free from the clutches of Rahu, like the sun
shining in the sky. ||28|| He was a resident of the abode of virtue, protected
by excellent secrets, had attained the five assemblies, and was devoted to the
five great vows. ||29|| He was the protector of the six types of living beings,
the destroyer of the three types of punishment (of mind, speech, and body), free
from the seven fears, and the destroyer of the sixteen types of pride. ||30||
His chest was adorned with the Srivatsa mark, his mind was devoted to the
adornment of virtues, and he was steadfast in attaining the truth of liberation.
Such Rama became an excellent Shraman. ||31|| Gods with invisible forms beat the
divine drums, and the pure-minded devotees, eager to express their devotion,
showered divine flowers. ||32|| When Rama departed from the great sin of
household life, the benevolent friends, the divine beings, and Jatayu celebrated
greatly. ||33|| When Rama was initiated there, the kings, all the earth-
dwellers, and the Vidyadharas were filled with wonder and thought: "Here,
Ramadeva, who was blessed by the gods, has renounced such difficult-to-renounce
wealth and become a Muni. What temptation is there for us to renounce? We are
devoid of the desire for vows." ||34-36|| Thinking thus, and lamenting within
themselves about their attachments, many, filled with emotion, broke free from
the bonds of home. ||37|| Shatrughna, having broken the fetters of attachment,
destroyed the enemy of hatred, and freed himself from all possessions, became a
Shraman. ||38|| Then Vibhishana, Sugriva, Nila, Chandranakha, Nala, Kravy,
Viradhit, and many other Vidyadhara kings also departed. ||39|| Those
Vidyadharas who renounced their knowledge... 1. Rahu-vinirmukta. 2. Surya-
mandala-vibhrama. 3. Swarthaih. 4. Nirgata.

The One Hundred and Nineteen Chapter 315 Thus, when Sri Rama had renounced the
world, sixteen thousand monks and more, O King, became monks. ||41|| Twenty-
seven thousand principal women became Aryikas, following the path of truth,
under the guidance of the venerable Shramanis. ||42|| Then, having received the
approval of his Guru, Padmabhini Grantha, alone, free from the duality of
pleasure and pain, took to wandering. ||43|| He used to dwell at night in the
deep caves of the mountains, which were frightening to those with restless
minds, and where the sounds of wild animals were prevalent. ||44|| He, the
holder of the supreme yoga and the follower of the right method, attained the
knowledge of clairvoyance in that very night. ||45|| By that clairvoyance, he
saw the entire world, as it is, as clearly as a pure crystal placed in the palm
of the hand. ||46|| Then, by that clairvoyance, he knew where Lakshmana had gone
in the previous birth, but his mind, having broken all bonds, did not fall into
any kind of delusion. ||47|| He thought, "Look, he spent a hundred years as a
prince, three hundred years as a king, and forty years in conquering the world.
||48|| He ruled for eleven thousand five hundred and sixty years. ||49|| And he,
having enjoyed twelve thousand years, minus twenty-five, went down, not being
satisfied with the pleasures." ||50|| There is no fault of the two gods in
Lakshmana's death; in reality, his time had come, under the pretext of his
brother's death. ||51|| My birth and his birth, along with that of Vasudatta and
others, have been intertwined in many different ways, all due to the influence
of delusion. ||52|| Thus, Padmamuni, the mountain of vows and conduct, and the
holder of supreme patience, knew all that had happened. ||53|| He, endowed with
the highest auspiciousness, profound, an ocean of virtues, magnanimous, and
devoted to the attainment of liberation, was a true seeker of liberation. ||54||
I tell you all who have gathered here, O Shrenik! Rejoice in the path of
righteousness, where the best of the Raghus, Sri Rama, is. ||55|| Many of those
who had taken the vows of renunciation and had received initiation, again
attained the state of a Charan. ||40||  Gautama Swami says, "O King! At that
time, when Rama took the vows of renunciation, sixteen thousand monks and more
became monks, and twenty-seven thousand principal women became Aryikas,
following the path of truth, under the guidance of the venerable Shramanis."

311 Padma Purana Those who are devoted to the teachings of the Jinas with both
strength and devotion, obtain a birth close to the path of liberation, where all
their desires are fulfilled. ||56|| O noble people! Having obtained the treasure
of the great teachings of the Jinas, abandon all the scriptures of the Kulangas,
which are full of sorrow. ||57|| Those whose minds are deluded by false
scriptures and who engage in deceitful and impure actions, like the blind,
abandon the path of liberation and go astray. ||58|| Many people, lacking
strength, see various tools as means and, saying, "There is no fault in
accepting these," accept them. They are Kulangas. Foolish people promote them in
vain. They carry a heavy burden, like those who are burdened with sorrow.
||59-60|| Truly, the Rishis are those who have no desire for possessions and no
need to beg. Therefore, one should serve the pure, unattached, virtuous saints,
who are endowed with good qualities. ||61|| Gautama Swami says, "O noble people!
Having heard the story of Baldev, abandon all worldly pleasures and strive to
become free from the desires that bind you to this world. This will prevent you
from suffering the scorching heat of the sun of sorrow." ||62|| Thus ends the
one hundred and nineteenth chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the Arsha,
composed by the Acharya Ravishena, which describes the initiation of Baldev.

## The Twentieth Chapter  Thus, O King, even a Dharnendra with a billion tongues
would be unable to describe the virtues of the yogi, Baldev. || 1 ||  After
fasting for twelve days, the wise and virtuous great ascetic, Yogi Ram, went to
the city of Nandastali to break his fast, following the proper rituals. || 2 ||
He appeared like a young sun, with his radiance, and like a second mountain,
with his stability. Due to his peaceful nature, he seemed like a second moon,
inaccessible to the sun. His heart was pure like crystal, and he was the best
among men. He seemed like embodied Dharma, or the affection of the three worlds,
or the joy of all beings, having attained oneness and stability. He was flooding
the earth with the flow of his great radiance, and filling the sky with clusters
of white lotuses. Seeing such Sri Ram, all the people of the city were filled
with awe. || 3-6 ||  People said to each other, "Oh, what a wonder! Oh, what a
wonder! Look, look! This is a form beyond the world, never seen before!" || 7 ||
"This is a great bull, extremely beautiful, coming here. Or, this is a wonderful
human-shaped Mandarachal, with long arms hanging down." || 8 ||  "Oh, his
patience is blessed, his strength and power are blessed, his form is blessed,
his radiance is blessed, his peace is blessed, his liberation is blessed, and
his speed is blessed." || 9 ||  "Who is this, so charming, coming from where? He
is steady, with a peaceful gaze, focused, and has remained so for an entire
epoch." || 10 ||  "What family has been adorned by this one, who has attained
great merit? Whose house does he grace with his presence, and whose good deeds
does he nourish with food?" || 11 ||  "Where in this world can there be another
form like Indra's? Oh, these are the best of men, Ram, whose mountain of
strength is unshakable." || 12 ||  Therefore, in accordance with your heart's
desire, your birth, your actions, and your beliefs, strive to make your life and
your deeds meaningful. || 13 ||

##  Translation:  318 Padmapurana  Seeing this, make your mind, sight, birth,
karma, intellect, body, and conduct meaningful. Thus, the city dwellers,
engrossed in the sight of Shri Rama, erupted in a beautiful, noisy clamor filled
with immense wonder. ||13-14||  After that, as Rama entered the city, the
streets, wide and long, were filled with groups of men and women, all engaged in
activities befitting the occasion. ||15||  Many beautiful women, eager and
holding vessels filled with various kinds of food, stood there, carrying heavy
loads of water. ||16||  Many men, with their belongings firmly secured, arrived
carrying full, beautiful water pots. ||17||  "O Master! Come here, O Master!
Stay here, O Muni! Please grace us with your presence here," such excellent
words spread everywhere. ||18||  Many people, their hearts overflowing with joy,
their bodies trembling with excitement, roared like lions, their voices
indistinct. ||19||  "O Muni! Victory to you, O Mountain of Merit! May you
prosper and be prosperous," the sky was filled with such repeated words. ||20||
"Bring the vessels quickly, look for the tray, bring the golden plate quickly,
bring the milk, bring the sugarcane, keep the yogurt nearby, quickly place the
kheer in the beautiful silver vessel, bring the granulated sugar and candy
quickly, fill this vessel with fragrant, cool water infused with camphor, bring
the group of puris quickly, place the excellent shikharini in the pitcher
according to the proper procedure, hey, clever one! Give the large, excellent
laddoos with joy," such words of the women and men made the city completely
absorbed in itself. ||21-25||  At that time, the people in that city were so
engrossed in the commotion that they did not care for heavy necessities, nor did
they even notice the children. ||26||  Many people, rushing through the narrow
lanes, knocked down the people standing with vessels in their hands. ||27||
Thus, the city, with its people's hearts soaring high and their actions driven
by the frenzy, became like a madman, all around. ||28||  The immense noise of
the people and their brilliance shattered even the strong pillars of the city.

## The Twentieth Century Chapter ### 360  The elephants, whose temples had long
held a vast store of ichor, were now overflowing with it, flooding the earth as
it poured from their cheeks and ears.  ||30||  Horses with erect ears, their
pupils centered in their eyes, having abandoned their grazing, stood with their
necks raised high, emitting deep whinnies. ||31||  Many horses, having broken
their bonds in fear, were followed by their terrified grooms, causing the people
to panic. ||32||  As long as the people, eager to give charity, were agitated by
the mutual commotion, the king, Prati-nandī, residing within his palace, was
disturbed by the thunderous roar, like that of a raging sea.  He was suddenly
filled with anger and exclaimed, "What is this?"  He then quickly ascended to
the roof of the palace, accompanied by his retinue. ||33-35||  Seeing the chief
sage, whose face was free from the blemishes and stains of the world, and whose
complexion was as white as the moon, the king commanded many valiant warriors,
"Go quickly and bring these excellent Muni-rajas here to me, with due respect
and reverence." ||36-37||  "As our lord commands," they said, and then, parting
the crowd, they went to the Muni-rajas. ||38||  Reaching them, they bowed their
heads, folded their hands, and with sweet voices, their minds captivated by the
Muni-rajas' radiance, they said, ||39||  "O Bhagavan! Please accept the desired
offering. Our lord requests you to visit his home with your blessings." ||40||
"What need have you for food prepared by ordinary people, which is unwholesome,
discolored, and tasteless?" ||41||  "Come, O great sage! Be pleased, and accept
the desired food, free from anxiety." ||42||  Having said this, the noble women,
who were eager to offer alms, were driven away by the king's soldiers, causing
them great sorrow. ||43||  Realizing that this obstacle had arisen due to the
manner of the offering, the Muni-rajas turned away from the king,

ascetic left.  Even more so than before, they were filled with sorrow.  ||45||
With hearts filled with anxiety, they made the entire world miserable.  The
ascetic went to the dense forest and did not perform the pratima yoga. ||46||
Seeing such a beautiful, captivating ascetic, who was like the sun to men, even
the animals were filled with great longing when he left. ||47|| Thus ends the

## The Twenty-First Century Chapter  **Verse 1:** The Muni-punga (great sage)
Sri Rama, after observing the second fast of five days, made this vow: "In this
forest, filled with herds of deer, I will accept only the alms that come to me.
I will not enter the city for alms."  **Verse 2:** While the Muni was thus
engaged in this difficult vow, a king named Pratinandin was captured by a wicked
horse.  **Verse 3:** His queen, Prabhava, filled with grief, searched for the
path of her husband's abduction, surrounded by a multitude of warriors. She
mounted her horse and set out, her heart filled with anxiety.  **Verse 4-5:**
"What will happen? How will I find my husband?" she thought, her mind racing.
She rode swiftly along the same path, her heart heavy with worry.  **Verse 6:**
As they were traveling, the wicked horse, carrying the abducted king, got stuck
in the mud of a lake, like a householder trapped in a worldly snare.  **Verse
7:** The beautiful queen, upon reaching the lake, saw its lotus-filled waters
and smiled slightly. She said, "Oh King, the horse did well!"  **Verse 8:** "If
you had not been captured by this horse, how would you have found this beautiful
lake, filled with flowers like those of Nandana forest?"  **Verse 9:** The king
replied, "Yes, this garden journey has been successful, for you have arrived in
the midst of this beautiful forest, which is impossible to tire of seeing."
**Verse 10:** Thus, with lighthearted conversation, the queen, surrounded by her
companions, stayed by the lake.  **Verse 11:** After playing in the clear water,
gathering flowers, and adorning each other, the king and queen sat down to eat.
**Verse 12:** At that moment, Muni-punga Sri Rama, who had completed his fast
and was skilled in the path of action, arrived near them.  **Verse 13:** Seeing
him, the king, filled with joy and trembling with excitement, stood up, along
with his queen.

102 Padmapurana Having bowed down, he said, "O Bhagavan, please stand here."
Then, having purified the earth, he worshipped it with lotuses and other
flowers. ||11|| The queen, lifting a vessel filled with fragrant water, gave it
to the muni, while the king washed his feet. ||15|| Then, the king, whose whole
body was filled with joy, with great respect, placed in a golden vessel, kheer
and other food, which was excellent in fragrance, taste, and appearance. Then,
with great faith, he offered this excellent food to the excellent vessel, i.e.,
the muni. ||16-17|| Then, just as the desire of a compassionate person to give
increases, so too, the food offered to the muni, due to the virtue of the
excellent gift, increased in the vessel. Meaning: Shri Ram Muni was the holder
of inexhaustible wealth, therefore, the food offered to him remained
inexhaustible in his vessel. ||18|| Knowing the giver to be endowed with the
virtues of faith, contentment, devotion, etc., the gods, with joyful minds,
celebrated him in the sky, i.e., they performed five wonders. ||19|| A
favorable, cool, gentle, fragrant wind blew. The gods, filled with joy, showered
fragrant flowers of five colors. In the sky, there was a sound of various kinds
of drums that captivated the ears. The excellent music of the apsaras mingled
with the sound of the drums. The gods of the Kamadeva clan, filled with
contentment, made various sounds and danced in the sky with various forms of
dance. ||20-22|| "Oh, what a gift! Oh, what a vessel! Oh, what a ritual! Oh,
what a god! Oh, what a giver! Blessed, blessed!" These words were uttered in the
sky. ||23|| "Grow, victory, happiness!" These and other words of the gods,
uttered in a loud voice, filled the sky-like pavilion. ||24|| Besides this, a
rain of wealth, filled with various jewels, gold, and other excellent
substances, fell, illuminating the ten directions. ||25|| Having received
worship from the gods and the deshavrat from the muni, the king, with pure
vision, attained glory on earth. ||26|| Thus, the king, along with his wife, who
was submissive in devotion, having given a gift to a worthy recipient,
experienced the ultimate joy, the fruit of having obtained human birth. ||27||
He became a khada. ||13||

## Ekavimsottarashatam Parva  Rama, having fulfilled the purpose of the time,
performed **vivakta-shayya-asana** (meditation in a secluded place) in the
middle of the night. His **tapas** (austerity) was so intense that he walked the
earth like a second sun. || 28 ||  Thus ends the one hundred and twenty-first
**parva** (chapter) of the **Padma Purana**, titled **Danaprasangabhidhanam**,

He experienced and considered human birth successful. || 27 || Here, Sri Rama,
following the dictates of the **Agamas**, performed **vivakta-shayya-asana** in
a secluded place and, with his **tapas** burning brightly, walked the earth in a
way that seemed like a second sun had arrived. || 28 ||  Thus ends the one
hundred and twenty-first **parva** (chapter) of the **Padma Purana**, titled
**Danaprasangabhidhanam**, composed by **Acharya Sri Ravishena**, known as

In the one hundred and twenty-second parva, the Lord Baldeva, who is tranquil
and free from envy, performed an extremely difficult penance that was impossible
for ordinary people. ||1||  While the sun shone in the middle of the sky, he,
who was observing the eighth day fast, wandered in the forest of Gopa for food,
and the cowherds worshipped him. ||2||  He was a knower of the scriptures, such
as the Vrata-Gupti-Samiti, a conqueror of the senses, affectionate towards the
virtuous, devoted to self-study, and a doer of good deeds. ||3||  Even after
attaining many great powers, he remained unmoved, supreme, a warrior against the
enemy of delusion, and eager to conquer it. ||4||  Due to the power of his
penance, tigers and lions became peaceful and looked at him with their eyes wide
open in joy, and herds of deer with their necks raised looked at him with great
love. ||5||  His mind was absorbed in liberation, free from desire and
attachment. Thus, the Lord, adorned with excellent qualities, wandered in the
forest with great effort, following the path of the Iryasami. ||6||  Sometimes
he stood on a rock, or sat on a raised seat, and entered into meditation, just
as the sun enters into the clouds. ||7||  He, the Lord, sometimes stood in a
beautiful place with his arms hanging down, motionless like Mount Meru, and
remained in a state of stillness. ||8||  Sometimes, the Lord Rama, who was
extremely peaceful and possessed the wealth of detachment, wandered, looking at
the earth, and the celestial nymphs who lived on the trees worshipped him. ||9||
Thus, the great sage Rama, who possessed an unparalleled soul, performed such a
difficult penance that in this fifth age, called Dushma, other humans cannot
even contemplate it. ||10||  Then, while wandering, Rama gradually reached the
Kotishila, which Lakshmana had previously worshipped and lifted with his arms.
||11||  The great soul Rama, who had broken the bonds of attachment and was
eager to destroy karma, ascended that rock and remained in a state of stillness
throughout the night. ||12||

405 The hundred and twenty-second chapter. Now, the one who had used the eye of
knowledge and was filled with great affection, the previous birth of Sita,
Achyuta, was seen by the Indra of the Achyuta heaven. ||13|| At that time, he
remembered his previous births and the great glory of the Jina's teachings in
order. ||14|| Remembering, he realized that this ornament of the world, King
Rama, was his husband when he was Sita in the human world. ||15|| He, the Indra,
thought, "Oh, what a strange thing, the various activities of the mind! What was
desired before is now desired differently." ||16|| "Oh, look at the different
tendencies of actions, good and bad. The birth of people is strange, as is
clearly seen here." ||17|| "These two, Balabhadra and Narayana, were wonders to
the world, but due to the influence of their own karmas, they have obtained the
upper and lower realms, that is, one will reside in the upper part of a realm
and one will be born in the lower realm." ||18|| "One, the elder, is a
diminished samsari and has a gross body, and the other, the younger, Lakshmana,
is a full samsari and is suffering in hell." ||19|| "Lakshmana, whose soul was
not satisfied with the enjoyments of the divine and human realms, is suffering
in hell due to his sinful pride." ||20|| "This lotus-eyed, glorious Balabhadra,
due to the separation from Lakshmana, has come to the refuge of the Jina."
||21|| "This beautiful one, who previously defeated external enemies with the
Halaratna, is now striving to conquer the senses with the power of meditation."
||22|| "At this time, he is riding on the Kshapaka chariot, so I do such a thing
that my friend becomes distracted from meditation." ||23|| "[And instead of
attaining liberation, he is born in heaven.] Then, due to the love born from
great friendship, I will happily go with him to Mount Meru and the Nandishvara
island. The beauty of that time will be unique. Riding on the top of the chariot
and accompanied by supreme glory, we will tell each other about our sorrows and
joys." ||24-25|| "Then, I will go with Rama, who performs auspicious deeds, to
bring Lakshmana, who has reached the lower realms, back to enlightenment."

In the Padma Purana, There, in the Nandana forest, where Rama, the righteous,
abides, The wind, laden with the pollen of many flowers, blows pleasantly. The
sound of birds, a delightful cacophony, fills the air. The strong, restless
swarm of bees buzzes around the fragrant Bakula trees. The melodious cuckoos
sing their sweet songs, While the parrots, perched on the Palasha trees, play
with their clear voices. The mango blossoms, adorned with bees, resemble the
sharp arrows of Kamadeva. The forest, painted yellow by the Karnika flowers,
seems ready for a game of play with yellow powder. The Bakula tree, ignoring the
intoxicating nectar of its flowers, showers its fragrance like a raincloud in
the monsoon. Then, the divine, self-effulgent, Kamadeva, assuming the form of
Janaki, Approaches Rama with a slow, languid gait. That forest, a delight to the
mind, is secluded, filled with diverse trees and flowers of all seasons. Then,
the great goddess Sita, wandering happily through the forest, Suddenly appeared
before the sage. She said, "O Rama, I have seen you, wandering through the
world, by the grace of great merit, however difficult it may be." "O Lord, I,
Suvadana, have fallen into the current of the river of love, filled with waves
of separation. Please save me from drowning." With her various gestures and
sweet words, she understood the sage's unwavering mind. She, whose heart was
filled with the sin of delusion, who stood before the sage and moved from side
to side, She, consumed by the fever of love, whose body trembled, and whose red,
full lips quivered, The enchanting Sita spoke to him, "O God, I, who was once a
devotee of the gods, Now, having renounced my own dharma, I wander as an
ascetic." The other thoughts, the other considerations, Sita's life, self-
effulgent god, came down from the Arunachala kalpa to the Sudharma kalpa with
the other gods. Then, moving from the Sudharma kalpa, he descended into that
vast forest of the earth, which seemed like the Nandana forest, where the great
sage Ramachandra was meditating. In that forest, a pleasant wind, carrying the
pollen of many flowers, was blowing, and the delightful sound of birds was heard
everywhere. On the Bakula tree, a strong group of bees was buzzing restlessly,
and the group of cuckoos was making loud, sweet sounds. The mynas, skilled in
producing various beautiful sounds, were making melodious sounds, and the
parrots, sitting on the Palasha trees, were playing, uttering clear words. The
mango blossoms, adorned with bees, seemed like the new, sharp arrows of
Kamadeva. The forest, appearing yellow due to the Karnika flowers, seemed as if
it were ready to play with yellow powder. The Bakula tree, ignoring the
intoxicating nectar of its flowers, was showering its fragrance like a group of
rainclouds in the monsoon. Then, that self-effulgent, divine, Kamadeva, who
could change his form at will, assuming the form of Janaki, Approached Rama with
a slow, languid gait, intending to go near him. That forest, a delight to the
mind, was secluded, filled with diverse trees and flowers of all seasons. Then,
the great goddess Sita, wandering happily through the forest, Suddenly appeared
before the sage. She said, "O Rama, I have seen you, wandering through the
world, by the grace of great merit, however difficult it may be." "O Lord, I,
Suvadana, have fallen into the current of the river of love, filled with waves
of separation. Please save me from drowning." When she understood the sage's
unwavering mind with her various gestures and sweet words, she, whose heart was
filled with the sin of delusion, who stood before the sage and moved from side
to side, She, consumed by the fever of love, whose body trembled, and whose red,
full lips quivered, The enchanting Sita spoke to him, "O God, I, who was once a
devotee of the gods, Now, having renounced my own dharma, I wander as an
ascetic." 1. Of the cuckoos. 2. They sang. 3. Like arrows. 4. Sharp. 5. With the
Bakula trees.

Chapter One Hundred Twenty-Two 407 Then, the daughters of the Sadvidyadharas
took me away. There, those learned daughters, giving various examples, said to
me, "This renunciation is useless in this state, for this renunciation is truly
only suitable for very old women." 43-44 Where is this youthful body, and where
is this difficult vow? Can a mountain be pierced by the rays of the moon? 45 We
will all go forward with you, and, O Devi, we will take Baldeva as our husband,
taking refuge in you. 46 You will be the chief queen among us all. In this way,
we will all play happily with Rama in Jambudvipa. 47 Meanwhile, thousands of
daughters, adorned with various ornaments and endowed with divine splendor,
arrived there. 48 Like the graceful gait of royal swans, they, born of the
reaction of Sita and Indra, went near Rama. 49 Some of them were speaking
sweetly, even more melodious than the cuckoo. Other daughters shone, as if
Lakshmi herself were standing there. 50 They were manifesting divine music, a
nectar for the ears, delightful to the mind, and accompanied by the sounds of
flutes and veenas. 51 They had hair as black as bees, their radiance like
lightning, they were very delicate and slender-waisted, they had large and
prominent breasts, they were charmingly laughing with amorous smiles, they were
wearing clothes of various colors and scents, they were speaking with various
gestures and words, and they had filled the sky with their radiance. All those
daughters, standing around the Muni, were creating infatuation, just as the
daughters of the gods had done around the powerful Bahubali. 52-54 One daughter,
seeking shade, went under a Bakula tree. Reaching there, she pulled the tree,
causing the swarm of bees sitting on it to fly towards her. Frightened by them,
that daughter went to the Muni for refuge. 55 Some daughters, engaged in a
dispute, were taking sides. They asked the Muni, "What is the name of this
tree?" 56

In the Padma Purana,   (57) A girl, pretending to pick flowers from the Madhavi
creeper, showed her arm root as her garment slipped.   (58) Many girls, with
their hands like swaying leaves and playing music with thousands of rhythms,
were ready to form a circle and dance.   (59) A girl, adorned with a scarlet
garment as pure as water, wore a sky-blue skirt out of shyness.   (60) Gautama
Swami says that Rama was not disturbed by these actions, which captivated the
minds of others, just as Mount Meru is not disturbed by the wind.   (61) With a
simple gaze and a pure soul, he was like a thunderbolt to the assembly of
demons, entering the first stage of white meditation, like the rising sun.
(62) His mind, filled with virtue, was extremely pure and focused on the Self,
along with the senses.   (63) Let external beings perform actions as they wish,
but those who are wise in the ultimate truth are not swayed from their own good.
(64) When Sītendra, desiring to disrupt meditation, attempted to create a divine
illusion with all his might,   (65) the highly pure sage arrived, ready to burn
the endless accumulation of karma.   (66) The Supreme Being, with firm resolve,
destroyed the sixty types of karma and ascended the highest level of the क्षपक
श्रेणी (kshapaka shreni).   (67) On the twelfth night of the bright fortnight of
Magha, the great soul attained Kevala Jnana.   (68) With the emergence of the
all-seeing Kevala Jnana eye, both the world and the beyond became insignificant
to the Lord, like a speck of dust.   (69) Then, the Indra, who had used the eye
of knowledge, bowed down in reverence, trembling as the throne shook.   (70) The
great beings, who were present among the great assembly of gods, were filled
with devotion and ready to worship the birth of Kevala Jnana.

One hundred and twenty-two chapters of the Padma Purana, known as the *Arsha*,
composed by the Acharya Ravishena, describe the attainment of *kevala jnana* by
Shri Rama Muni.   **Chapter 122: The Birth of Kevala Jñana**  **Verse 70:** All
the Indras, with great splendor, arrived there.  **Verse 71:** The *charana*
sages, all the gods and demons, bowed down to Rama, seated on his throne, the
destroyer of *ghāti karma*.  **Verse 72:** The entire *samavasarana* of the
Supreme Lord, who had attained the form of the Self and was worthy of worship by
all the lords of the world, was established.  **Verse 73:** Then, *Sitaindra*,
known as *Svayamprabha*, performed the worship of *kevala jnana* and
circumambulated the Muni twice, repeatedly seeking his forgiveness.  **Verse
74:** He said, "O Lord, forgive the fault committed by me, a fool. Be pleased
and grant me the end of my *karma*, even if it is great, quickly."  **Verse
75:** Gautama Swami says, "Thus, the Lord Baldeva, with infinite radiance and
beauty, and with a joyful countenance, attained *kevala jnana* and infinite
happiness, the wealth of *samavritti*, through the supreme devotion of the
*vajino*."  **Verse 76:** When the Muni Shri Rama, radiant like the sun among
the sages, was about to go on a pilgrimage, the gods, filled with joy, quickly
performed the worship, praise, and prostration of the Muni, according to their
respective positions, and then departed.

## The Thirty-Second Chapter  And remembering the ocean of virtues of Lakshmana,
the Lord of Sita, desiring to awaken Balukaprabha, set out. ||1||  Crossing the
Manushottara mountain, inaccessible to mortals, and surpassing the Ratnaprabha
and Sharkaraprabha lands, he reached the third land, Balukaprabha. ||2||  There
he saw the extremely repulsive, unbearable suffering of the hell-bound beings,
born from evil deeds. ||3||  The Asura son, Shambuka, who was slain by
Lakshmana, was indulging in violent play like a hunter's son. ||4||  He would
bind some hell-bound beings and kill them himself, have others killed by his
servants, and make others fight each other. ||5||  Some, with distorted voices,
were bound and thrown into fire pits, while others were impaled on thorny trees.
||6||  Some were beaten with iron maces by those standing around, while others
were fed their own flesh and blood by merciless gods. ||7||  Some, broken by
severe blows, lay on the ground, being devoured by dogs, cats, lions, tigers,
and birds. ||8||  Some were pierced on spikes, beaten with heavy hammers, and
others were thrown into jars filled with molten copper and other metals. ||9||
Some, bound to wooden stakes, were immobile and pierced with iron hooks, while
others were forcibly fed molten copper and other metals. ||10||  Some were
crushed in mills, others pierced with arrows, and still others suffered the
torment of having their teeth, eyes, and tongues torn out. ||11||  Seeing such
suffering of the hell-bound beings, the Lord of Sita was filled with immense
compassion. ||12||

411 The twenty-third chapter of the Pर्व is about Lakshmana being taken out of
the fire pit and being tormented by many Narakas from all sides. ||13|| He saw
Lakshmana being tormented by the terrible waters of the Vaitarani, filled with
vicious crocodiles, and being pierced by the sharp leaves of the Asipatra
forest. ||14|| He also saw a terrifying Naraka, enraged and wielding a huge
mace, ready to kill Lakshmana, while another Naraka was striking him. ||15|| He
saw Ravana, with terrifying eyes, his body covered in filth, and his mouth wide
open, being urged on by the Asura prince Shambuka, who was encouraging him
against Lakshmana. ||16|| Meanwhile, the mighty Sitaindra arrived, scolding the
wicked group of Bhavanavasis. ||17|| He said, "Oh, wicked Shambuka! What have
you started? When will your cruel heart find peace?" ||18|| "Oh, lowly god! Give
up your cruel deeds, be calm. What is the purpose of this pride, which is the
cause of great misfortune?" ||19|| "Even hearing about the suffering of Naraka
fills a being with fear. Why are you not afraid, seeing it directly?" ||20||
When Shambuka calmed down, Sitaindra was about to speak to him, but the Narakas,
who were cruel, fickle, and hard-hearted, fled in all directions, terrified by
the radiance of the gods. ||21-22|| Some of the miserable Narakas, with faces
drenched in tears, cried out in sorrow. Some ran and fell into deep, uneven
pits. ||23|| Sitaindra, comforting them, said, "Oh, Narakas! Don't run away,
don't be afraid. You are all very distressed, come back. Don't be afraid, don't
be afraid, stand still." Even after being told this, they trembled with fear and
entered the deep darkness. ||24-25|| When Sitaindra repeated these words, their
fear subsided somewhat, and they reluctantly paid attention. ||26|| 1.

412 Padmapurana Those whose souls are consumed by great delusion, how can they
not be born in hell? Being in this state, you do not know what is good for your
soul. ||27|| Those who have not seen the end of the universe, who are devoted to
violence, falsehood, and stealing the property of others, who are filled with
fierce meditation, and who are hostile to those who are in hell, are the ones
who reach hell. ||28|| Those who are attached to the right to enjoy, who are
delighted by intense anger and other passions, and who are constantly engaged in
harmful actions, are the ones who attain this kind of suffering. ||29|| Then,
seeing the excellent god on the beautiful chariot, Lakshmana and Ravana first
asked, "Who are you?" ||30|| Then the god told them the whole story of Rama and
himself, and also said that according to karma, all these strange things are
possible. ||31|| Then, hearing their own story, they attained enlightenment and
their souls became calm. They lamented in this way, filled with sorrow. ||32||
"Alas! Why did we not engage in dharma during our human birth? Because of our
evil deeds, we have attained this state." ||33|| "Alas! Alas! What terrible
deeds have we done that bring suffering to our souls? Oh, the greatness of
delusion, that it even surpasses self-interest!" ||34|| "You are blessed, O
Indra, because you have given up desire for worldly things and, having drunk the
nectar of the words of the Jinas, have attained the lordship of the gods."
||35|| Then, filled with great compassion, Indra said many times, "Do not fear,
do not fear. Come, come, I will take you out of hell and bring you to heaven."
||36|| Then, girding his loins, Indra was ready to take them himself, but they
could not be grasped. Just as ghee melts in fire, so too did those hell-beings
melt and remain there. ||37|| Indra tried all means to lift them, but they could
not be lifted. Just as reflections in a mirror cannot be grasped, so too could
they not be grasped. ||38|| Then, filled with great sorrow, those hell-beings
said, "O god, the karmas we have accumulated in the past are undoubtedly worthy
of being experienced." ||39||

## The Twenty-Third Hundredth Chapter  **413**  Those who are greedy for worldly
pleasures and have attained the suffering of hell, what can the gods do for
those who are subject to the results of their own actions? **40**  Since the
karma done by oneself has to be experienced according to its nature, O God! You
are not able to liberate us from suffering. **41**  O Sītendra! Protect us, tell
us what we should do so that we may not attain hell again. You are merciful to
us. **42**  Then the God said, "That which is excellent, eternal, blissful,
supreme, a secret for the foolish, famous in the three worlds, the destroyer of
karma, pure, holy, the giver of the ultimate truth, never attained before, or if
attained, not protected by the careless, unknowable to the unworthy, causing
fear in the long cycle of existence, such is the noble and rare Right Faith, the
greatest welfare of the soul." **43-45**  If you desire your own welfare, then
even in this state, attain Right Faith. This Right Faith is auspicious, granting
enlightenment in due time. **46**  There is no other welfare greater than this,
nor was there, nor will there be. In its presence, the great sages become
Siddhas, are becoming Siddhas, and were Siddhas in the past. **47**  As the
great Arhats, the Jinas, have described the nature of the soul and other
entities, so it is. Thus, to have firm faith with devotion is Right Faith.
**48**  Although Sītendra had caused those in hell to attain Right Faith through
his words, he was still grieving for them, being the enjoyer of excellent
pleasures. **49**  Their former beautiful bodies, full of radiance and
loveliness, were burnt by karma, like a new garden by fire. **50**  Seeing this,
the whole world was astonished. Where did their radiant beauty, full of noble
and graceful playfulness, go? **51**  He said to them, "Look, because of that
small pleasure in the realm of karma, you have become immersed in this ocean of
suffering by doing evil deeds." **52**  Thus, when Sītendra spoke, those who had
been afflicted in countless births attained the supreme Right Faith, which they
had never attained before. **53**

In the Padma Purana, Having experienced that unbearable suffering, they were
relieved.  They ascended and attained the human realm, seeking refuge in the
Jina. ||54|| Oh, most supreme God, you have done us a great favor.  You have
brought us together in this delightful, true vision. ||55|| Oh, great Sītendra!
Go, go to your Āraṇācyuta kalpa.  Experience the vast fruit of pure dharma and
attain liberation. ||56|| Thus spoken to, that Sītendra, though free from the
causes of sorrow, still grieved inwardly, being endowed with supreme power.
||57|| Granting them solace, he, the great, virtuous Sūrendra, gave them a
beneficial, enlightening discourse and ascended to his own abode. ||58|| His
soul filled with fear, he, devoted to the four refuges, circumambulated Mount
Meru many times. ||59|| Remembering the suffering of hell, that best of the
gods, his soul trembling, even in his chariot, heard that sound, the wise one.
||60|| His heart trembling, his face like the moon, that wise Sūrendra was eager
to descend again to the land of Bharata. ||61|| With a multitude of chariots,
swift as the wind, filled with horses, lions, and herds of intoxicated
elephants, ||62|| With celestial beings adorned in garments of various colors,
their crowns shining with monkeys and garlands, riding various vehicles, adorned
with flags and umbrellas, ||63|| Holding bows, arrows, swords, spears, and
maces, those beautiful gods, accompanied by groups of apsaras, moved everywhere.
||64|| The sky was filled with the sounds of mṛdanga, duṇḍubhi, flutes, and
vīṇās, mixed with shouts of victory, joy, and prosperity. ||65|| Then, Sītendra,
the bearer of supreme good fortune, went to the refuge of Padma.  With folded
hands, he bowed repeatedly in devotion. ||66|| Thus, with humility, he began to
praise him, his mind firmly set on the means of liberation from the cycle of
birth and death. ||67||

The Twenty-third Hundredth Chapter 415 He who has subdued his self with the wind
of meditation and the fire of knowledge, has burnt the forest of his birth.
||6|| He has slain the enemy of delusion with the trident of pure knowledge, and
crushed the cage of attachment with the thunderbolt of firm dispassion. ||66|| O
Lord, I am lost in the forest of existence, caught in the doubt of the present.
Be my refuge, O Muniendra, O Bhavasudan. ||7|| O Rama, you have attained all
that is attainable, you are the knower of all, you have accomplished your
purpose, and you are the Guru of the world. Protect me, my mind is very
troubled. ||71|| By diligently serving the teachings of Muni Suvrata Nath, you
have crossed the ocean of existence with the boat of your great penance. ||72||
O Rama, is it right for you to leave me completely and go alone to that high,
pure, and imperishable abode? ||73|| Then the Muni said, "O Suradhip, give up
attachment, for liberation is for the one who is established in dispassion, and
attachment leads to rebirth. ||74|| Just as a river cannot be crossed with a
stone tied around the neck, so too, the world cannot be crossed with attachment.
||75|| He who is constantly absorbed in knowledge and follows the words of his
Guru, can cross the ocean of existence with the boat of knowledge, virtue, and
non-attachment. ||76|| Gautama Swami said, "O King, the wise should understand
that the great and powerful Kevali knows the qualities of all things at all
times, in the beginning, middle, and end. ||77|| O King, I will now tell you
what Sitadeva asked and what the Kevali answered. ||78|| Sitadeva asked the
Kevali, "O Lord, O Omniscient, where are those noble beings like Dasharatha? And
what have you seen of the fate of Lavana and Ankush? Where will they be born?"
||79|| Then the Kevali said, "King Dasharatha has become a god in the Anat

416 Pam Purana Janaka and Kanaka, both devoted to right faith, are equal in
merit due to their own efforts and karma. ||1|| The two ascetics, Lavana and
Ankusha, are equal in knowledge and vision. They are pure and will attain the
imperishable state. ||2|| Hearing this, the great Indra was overjoyed.
Remembering his brother, he asked about his well-being out of affection. ||3||
"Your brother too," was the reply. Hearing this, Sita Indra was saddened. He
folded his hands and asked the sage, "Where was he born?" ||4|| Padmanabha
(Rama) then said, "O Achyutendra! Listen to what I say about your brother's
birth and his present state." ||5|| In Ayodhya, there was a wealthy merchant
named Vajrang, the master of his clan, possessing countless riches and enjoying
worldly pleasures with his beloved Makari. ||86|| He had many sons and lived a
life of splendor like a king. Hearing of Sita's exile, he was filled with worry,
thinking, "How could Sita, so delicate and adorned with divine qualities, have
ended up in the forest?" He was deeply saddened by this thought. ||87-88|| This
compassionate man, filled with disgust for the world, renounced worldly
pleasures and became a disciple of the sage Dhuti. His initiation was unknown to
his family. ||89|| He had two virtuous sons, Ashoka and Tilaka. One day, they
went to the sage Dhuti to inquire about their father. ||90|| Seeing their father
there, they too were moved by affection and renunciation and became disciples of
Dhuti. ||91|| Dhuti, after performing intense austerities and reaching the end
of his lifespan, attained the state of Ahamindra, leaving behind his disciples
with a sense of longing. ||92|| Following their guru's instructions, the father
and his two sons, all three ascetics, set out to pay homage to the Jina in
Tamrachudpur. ||93|| On their way, they encountered a vast expanse of sand,
fifty yojanas wide. They were unable to reach their destination and a long time
passed. ||94|| Suprija (Suprabha) and Aparajita (Kaushalya), Janaka and Kanaka,
all devoted to right faith, are equal in merit due to their own efforts and
karma, residing in the same celestial abode. ||80-81|| The two ascetics, Lavana
and Ankusha, are equal in knowledge and vision. They are pure and will attain
the imperishable state, free from the dust of karma. ||82|| Hearing this, the
great Indra was overjoyed. Remembering his brother, he asked about his well-

The Twenty-First Hundred Chapter 11. There, having obtained a rare tree,
comparable to the merit of giving to the worthy, those three ascetics stayed
there, with its many branches and sub-branches. ||15|| Then, as the son of
Janaka was going to the city of Kosala, he saw those three ascetics. And in his
mind, this thought arose in this virtuous soul: ||16|| "These ascetics are
staying here in this desolate forest for the sake of upholding their vows, but
where will they get food to sustain their lives?" ||17|| Thinking thus, and with
great generosity, he built a very beautiful city nearby, which was full of all
kinds of provisions. He also showed places for the announcement-makers,
cowherds, etc. to stay. Then, with his natural demeanor, he bowed to the
ascetics with humility. ||18|| He stayed there with his family and, at the right
time and place, he offered food with joy and justice to the virtuous people who
came into his sight. ||100|| He satisfied all those ascetics who were in that
desolate forest, as well as other virtuous people who were afflicted in the
world and who had attained excellent self-control. ||101|| One should cite the
example of Bhammandala, who was a devotee of Dharma, as a servant of those who
are engaged in commerce in the ocean of merit, who are devoted to liberation.
That is, the ascetics are like those who are engaged in commerce in the ocean of
merit, and Bhammandala is like their servant. ||102|| One day, Bhammandala had
gone to the garden and was lying down comfortably on a bed with his wife,
Malini, when a sudden storm killed him. ||103|| Then, due to the merit arising
from giving to the ascetics, he was reborn in the divine Kuru, south of Mount
Meru, with a lifespan of three palyas and adorned with divine marks. ||104||
Thus, he, who possessed great brilliance, enjoyed the fruits of giving to the
worthy in that divine Kuru, with his beautiful wife, Malini, and attained great
expansion. ||105|| Those powerful people who satisfy the worthy by giving them
food, attain the land of enjoyment and the supreme state. ||106|| Those men who
have fallen from the land of enjoyment enjoy pleasures in heaven. The nature of
those who reside there is that giving is the wealth of enjoyment. ||107|| Time
has come. ||14||

In the Padma Purana, it is said that "Giving is the cause of heaven and
liberation." Hearing this, Ravana, who had fallen into the sand, asked again.
"Knowing that Lakshmana had fallen into the lower realms, Narayana said, 'Who
will experience the end of evil? What path will the ten-headed one attain? What
will I become? I wish to know this.'  "Having asked this question to the self-
effulgent one, the omniscient one spoke words about the future and the possible
future.  "He said, 'O Sita-Indra, listen! Ravana and Lakshmana, due to the
fruition of their own actions, will experience the suffering of hell and, after
emerging from the third hell, will be born in the city of Vijayavati, east of
Mount Mandara. They will be the sons of Rohini, the wife of Sunanda, a Samyak-
drishti householder. Their names will be Arhad-dasa and Rishi-dasa. These sons
will be known for their good qualities, possessors of a very festive mind, and
eager to perform praiseworthy actions.  "They will worship the Lord of Lords,
the Jina, according to the rules of householders, and will be followers of the
Anuvrata. In the end, they will die and become excellent gods.  "There, they
will enjoy the pleasures of the five senses for a long time, and then, after
falling from that state, they will be reborn in the same great family.  "Then,
due to the power of their past giving, they will attain Hari-kshetra and go to
heaven. After falling from there, they will be born as princes in the same city.
"Their father will be named Kumarakirti and their mother will be named Lakshmi.
These two Kumaras will be named Jayakant and Jayaprabha.  "After that, they will
perform austerities and attain the Lantva heaven. There, they will attain the
position of a supreme god and enjoy the pleasures associated with that state.
"O Sita-Indra, you, having fallen from the Aranachya-chuta kalpa, will be born
in the city of Ratna-sthala-pura in this Bharat-kshetra. You will be a glorious
chakravarti, the lord of all jewels, named Chakra-ratha.  "Those two gods,
Ravana and Lakshmana, who had become gods in the Lantva heaven, will fall from
there and, due to the influence of the essence of merit, will be your sons,
Indra-ratha and Ambhodara-ratha."  "For, it is the nature of the people there
that they truly obtain wealth through giving. Giving brings happiness, and
giving is the main cause of heaven and liberation."

The twenty-third chapter of the book. This was your enemy, the mighty
Dashavaktra, who had subdued three parts of Bharatavarsha. ||23|| One should not
desire another's wife, this is the firm resolve. Even if one has to give up
one's life, one should uphold truth. ||12|| He, becoming Indra-ratha, will be
devoted to Dharma. He will attain many excellent births, excluding hell. ||25||
He will attain human birth, which is rare for all beings. He will acquire the
karma of a Tirthankara, being virtuous. ||126|| Then, in turn, he will receive
worship from the three worlds. He will destroy the group of enemies like
delusion and attain Arhathood. ||12|| Having established his kingdom in
Ratnasthalapura, he, the Chakra-ratha, will attain the position of Indra in the
Vaimantaka heaven by the power of his austerities. ||128|| You, having fallen
from the heaven, will be the first Ganadhara, glorious and prosperous, of that
Jina. ||126|| Then you will attain the ultimate Nirvana, O Amreshvara. Having
heard this, the lord of the gods, Sita, was filled with supreme joy, his inner
self being filled with devotion. ||130|| This is the description of the being of
Lakshmana, as narrated by the omniscient. He, becoming Ambodara-ratha, the son
of Chakra-dhara, ||131|| will wander through many excellent births, engaged in
righteous conduct. In the city of Shatapatra, in the Videha region, on the
island of Pushkara, ||132|| Lakshmana, at the appropriate time, will attain his
birth-ceremony. He will obtain the greatness of Chakra-pani and attain Nirvana.
||133|| I too, after completing seven years, will be free from rebirth and go
where the virtuous ones like Bharata have gone. ||134|| Having understood the
account of future births, the lord of the gods, Sita, free from doubt, filled
with great devotion, ||135|| bowed down to Padma-nabha again and again. He went
to worship the stupas, which were rising there, with great joy. ||136|| He
worshipped the Nirvana-places of the Jinas with great devotion. He worshipped
the images of the Jinas in the island of Nandishvara with great reverence.
||137|| And he will have a son named Megha-ratha. ||122||

In the Padma Purana,  He, bearing the Jina in his mind, was constantly free from
defilement. He attained Kevalya, the supreme bliss, and held it. ||13||
Considering his karma as defiled and impure, he was well-behaved and happy. He
ascended to heaven, surrounded by a group of gods. ||13|| He went to heaven
then, due to his ancient brotherly love. He saw the beings of the Bhamandala in
Devakuru and spoke pleasantly with them. ||14|| In that Aranachya Utte Kalpa,

their delight. ||141|| His lifespan was seventeen thousand years, and his
height, along with Lakshmana's, was sixteen bows. ||142|| Gautama Swami says,
"Knowing this difference between merit and demerit, it is best to abandon
demerit completely and accumulate merit." ||143|| _Gautama Swami says, "O King!
See, in the excellent rule of the Jina, the powerful Balabhadra, the holder of
the Padma, who has attained fortitude, has defeated the mighty enemies, birth,
old age, and death." ||144|| He, Ramachandra, by the grace of the Jina, has
attained the eternal, supreme, and excellent bliss of Kevalya, which is
extremely rare, free from faults, and unparalleled, having destroyed birth, old
age, and death. ||145|| He, who is praised, honored, and worshipped by the
Munindras, Devas, and Asuras, who has destroyed his faults, who is sung by
hundreds of types of joy, and whose sight is difficult due to the abundance of
flower showers from the Vidyadharas, that great Muni, Rama, attained the peak of
the three worlds, the abode of the Siddhas, the ornament of all beings, by
worshipping the Jain Dharma for twenty-five years with excellent methods.
||146-147|| O noble ones! Bow your heads to that Lord Rama, who is the holder of
yoga, the holder of pure heart and pure feelings, who has destroyed the causes
of worldly existence, who is a hero in conquering the enemies of karma, who is
pleasing to the mind, and who is the best among the Munis. ||148||

The Twenty-third Hundredth Chapter  He who conquered the youthful sun, who
subdued the full moon's orb, who was exceedingly strong, who was worshipped by
the Jiva-Indra, Sita, due to past affection or because of his righteous conduct,
and who attained supreme prosperity,  salute that Muni-chief, Sri Ramachandra.
|| 146-150 ||  He who was the eighth among the Baladevas, whose body was
exceedingly pure, who was glorious, who was the bearer of infinite strength, who
was adorned with hundreds of thousands of rules, and whose all vices were
destroyed. || 151 ||  He who was the bearer of many virtues and hundreds of
thousands of excellent qualities, whose fame was exceedingly pure, who was
generous, who was endowed with the lamp of knowledge, who was spotless, and
whose brilliant fame spread throughout the three worlds, salute that Sri Rama.
|| 152 ||  He who burnt the veil of karma, who was the ocean of profound
virtues, whose agitation had ceased, who was unshakable like Mount Mandara, and
who followed the righteous conduct of the Shramanas, salute that Sri Rama. ||
153 ||  He who destroyed the enemies of passions, who renounced all dualities
completely, who attained the supreme lordship of the three worlds, who was
devoted to the teachings of the Jina, who had eradicated the dust of sin, who
was absorbed in right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, who was the
destroyer of the world, and who was eager to destroy all suffering, salute that
Muni-chief, Sri Rama. || 154-155 ||  The words "Cheshtita", "Anagha", "Charita",
"Karana", and "Charitra" are all synonymous, therefore, Rama's actions are
called Ramayana. || 156 ||  He whose heart is filled with wonder and joy, and
from whose mind all doubts have vanished, such a person who reads or listens to
the story of Baldeva with a devotional mind every day, attains an increase in
his lifespan and accumulates merit. Even an enemy with a sword in his hand does
not harbor any animosity towards him, and his anger subsides. || 157-158 ||
Salute. || 148 ||

## Chapter 422 of the Padma Purana  **Verse 15:** One who desires Dharma attains
Dharma, one who desires fame attains supreme fame. One who has lost his kingdom
regains it, there is no doubt about it.  **Verse 16:** One who desires the
company of his beloved attains it quickly, one who desires wealth attains
wealth. One who desires a wife attains a virtuous wife, and one who desires a
son attains a son who brings joy to his lineage.  **Verse 161:** One who desires
profit attains the best profit, which brings happiness. One who is skilled in
foreign travel remains safe, and one who stays in his own country has all his
desires fulfilled.  **Verse 162:** His illness subsides, the inhabitants of
villages and cities are pleased with the gods, and even the crooked planets like
the Sun and Moon are pleased with the stars.  **Verse 163:** Worries, evil
thoughts, and hundreds of sins are destroyed. Whatever other inauspicious things
there are, all of them are destroyed by the stories of the Padma Purana.
**Verse 164:** One who is devoted to the chanting of Rama's name attains
whatever good is hidden in his heart. Firm devotion, focused on the realm of the
omniscient, fulfills one's desires.  **Verse 165:** One who possesses a good
nature, through devotion to the Jina, destroys the sins accumulated over
hundreds of thousands of births, crosses the ocean of suffering, and quickly
attains the Arhathood.  **Verse 166:** This is a Shārdūlavikrīḍita verse, well-
composed, skillfully crafted, divine, and filled with sacred letters. It
destroys the mass of afflictions accumulated over thousands of births. It is
filled with various stories, narrates the deeds of virtuous men, and brings
supreme joy to the lotus-like beings. It is sung with devotion.  **Verse
157-158:**  Punya increases, and even one who draws his sword and holds it in
his hand does not become an enemy, but attains peace.

## The Twenty-Third Hundredth Chapter  This Padmacharitra, declared by the all-
knowing Lord Vardhamana, is narrated by Indra-bhuiti, the disciple of Jambū, and
further revealed by the eloquent disciple, the sage Kirti-dhara, for the benefit
of the disciples of Jambū. This Padmacharitra, which enhances the well-being,
virtue, and meditation, is the ultimate auspiciousness. ||167||  This
Padmacharitra, a series of steps like the minds of the great sages who know all
the scriptures, is full of good sayings, full of essence, and extremely
wonderful. Indra-guru had a disciple, Divakara-yati, who had a disciple,
Arhadyati, who had a disciple, Lakshmana-sena Muni, and I, Ravi-sena, am his
disciple. ||168||  This Purana, which is excellent due to the causes of purity
of right faith, is beneficial, vast, very clear, excellent, pure, prosperous,
and a giver of the three jewels, is worthy of being heard continuously by wise
people who desire self-benefit, as it narrates the greatness of the virtuous Sri
Rama, who is of extraordinary prowess. ||169||  **Verse (1)**  The story of
Balabhadra, Narayana, and their enemy Ravana is famous throughout the world. In
it, the wise man, by intellect, accepts the good and rejects the bad. ||170||
The good character is one that increases virtues, and the bad character is one
that increases suffering. The person who desires a particular object befriends
that which is related to it. The one who desires virtues befriends good
character, and the one who desires suffering befriends bad character. ||171||
This Padmacharitra, which I have described, is due to my devotion. ||166||

## Chapter 424: The Puranas  **172.** If even the king of the Vidyadharas,
Ravana, who desired other women, met with misfortune and died of the disease of
lust, what to speak of others who are addicted to sensual pleasures?  **173.**
Even Ravana, who was constantly served by thousands of beautiful women, met his
end due to his insatiable desires. To say that others will be satisfied is mere
delusion.  **174.** Abandoning the happiness of one's own wife, the sinner who
seeks pleasure in other women enters the vast ocean of suffering like a dry
piece of wood.  **175.** O noble ones! Quickly go to the place where Baldeva and
other great souls have gone, imbued with the love of the Jain teachings and
having attained a strong and virtuous character according to your capacity.
**176.** By the fruits of good deeds, a being attains a high position and a
treasure of great wealth. By the fruits of evil deeds, it suffers the misery of
a bad rebirth. This is the nature of things.  **177.** Excessive anger, delight
in harming others, and harsh speech are the first signs of evil deeds. Humility,
learning, good conduct, compassionate speech, non-envy, and forgiveness are all
good deeds.  **178.** Alas! No one gives wealth, health, happiness, or anything
else to humans. Even if it is said that the gods give these things, why are they
themselves so numerous in their suffering?  **179.** What is the point of saying
much? O wise ones! With effort, understand the one supreme Self and the essence
of karma, which is full of diverse results. Always delight in the means of
attaining it.  **180.** O wise ones! We have described the means of attaining
the ultimate truth in this text. Employ them with all your might so that you may
cross the ocean of existence.

## The One Hundred Twenty-Third Chapter  This scripture, bestowed by the **Jiva-
Vishuddhi-Dana**, is extremely delightful and shines like the sun's light
throughout the universe, illuminating all things.    This **Padma Purana** was
composed by **Padma Muni** after one thousand two hundred and three years and
six months had passed since the **Jina-Bhaskara** **Vardhamana**
**Siddheshvara** attained **moksha**.  May all the **Samaya-Devata**s, who are
devoted to the **Jina**s, grace this work and make the entire world devoted to
the **Jina**s. May they, filled with all kinds of respect and love for the
world, protect the **agama** with their words in all matters.  Whatever is
mentioned here, whether ending in a consonant or a vowel, is the word that
signifies the meaning. A group of words is called a sentence.    **Lakshana**,
**Alankara**, **Abhidheya**, **Lakshya**, and **Vyanga** are the three types of
**vachya**. **Pramana**, **Chanda**, and **Agama** are also explained here
according to the context. One should understand all this with a pure heart.
This **Padma Charita** is said to contain eighteen thousand and twenty-three
verses in **Anushtup** meter.  Thus ends the one hundred and twenty-third
chapter of the **Padma Purana**, composed by **Ravi-Shena Acharya**, known as
**Parsha**, which describes the attainment of **siddhi** by **Baldeva**.

## Tokak Prashasti  On the banks of the Dasha Sarita river, Paragram stands
tall, Where Liladhara, a Jain, resided, a devotee of the faith, they call. (1)
Three sons he had, devoted to the Jain Dharma's way, Gali Lal, Nanda Lal, and
Pyare Lal, adorned with righteousness, they say. (2)  Pyare Lal, known for his
ocean of compassion, kind and true, Gali Lal's wife, Janaki, a woman as pure as
the morning dew. (3)  Three sons were born to them, radiant as the morning sun,
The eldest, Alambendu, known as Latore Lal, his journey begun. (4)  The middle
son, wise and learned, was called Panna Lal, a name to revere, When their father
passed, their mother, with her sons, sought solace near. (5)  With the help of
her relatives, she found support and strength anew, Alambendu, alas, departed,
his life cut short, a tragic view. (6)  Their mother, with her two sons, faced
hardship and despair, Panna Lal, with his revered feet, led them to a place of
care. (7)  He entered the great university in Sagar, a place of wisdom and
might, His mother, with her second son, bore the burden of their plight. (8)
Panna Lal, in the university, learned with humility and grace, He became a
scholar, beloved by his teachers, in a short space. (9)  Loknath, then Chedi
Lal, a scholar among scholars, bright and bold, Kapileshwar, Mukund, and Babu
Ram, with minds sharp and keen, we're told. (10)  Through their blessings, he
mastered the ocean of sound and speech, He excelled in the art of poetry, a
journey smooth and sleek. (11)  He was a master of Samyaktv, a wellspring of
compassion, pure and true, Daya Chandra, a wise man, a master of Dharma and law,
anew. (12)  He became a teacher of Dharma and law, a guide for all to see, He
was honored with the title "Shastri," in literature and philosophy. (13)  He
earned the title of "Sahitya Acharya," a recognition well-deserved, In his own
university, he taught, by the learned and revered. (14)  He was appointed as a
teacher, skilled in the art of instruction, He carried the burden of his family,
with love and devotion. (15)  But fate, cruel and unforgiving, took his middle
son away, His beloved brother, snatched from his side, on a fateful day. (16)
Overwhelmed with grief, he bore the weight of sorrow deep, He pondered the
mysteries of karma, and sought solace in his sleep. (17)  He wrote many books, a
master of composition, clear and bright, Some he edited, others he translated,
with all his might. (18)  Suri Ravishena, in a beautiful language, wrote a tale,
The life of Padma Nath, a story that will never fail. (19)  What is its
greatness? Read it yourself, and let your heart be filled, With joy and wonder,
as you delve into its pages, unyielding. (20)  Samyaktv will surely arise, from
the study of this sacred text, Panna Lal, with his commentary, the meaning he
did dissect. (21)  The joy he felt while writing this commentary, words cannot
express, It resonated deep within his heart, a feeling of blessedness. (22)  On
the seventh day of the week, in the language of the wise, In the western hour of
the night, his commentary did arise. (23)  In the year 2484, of the Vira era, it
was complete, This commentary, a delight to the wise, a treasure to greet. (24)
This ocean of ancient lore, adorned with waves of meaning profound, I seek
refuge in Ravishena, the great poet, renowned. (25)  May I never misinterpret
the teachings of the Jinas, with my hands, This fear lingers in my mind, as I
strive to understand. (26)  Yet, I know, this ocean of knowledge is deep and
vast, I am but a small boat, burdened with the cares of life, amassed. (27)  At
every step, I seek guidance, from you, my wise friends, Forgive me, for my heart
is not a betrayer of the Jinas' words, I contend. (28)  This book is complete.

is pure. His own wealth. Observing her, then going away. Going with affection.
Seeing her with affection, Saumitra was struck like by a thunderbolt. 184 366
Some are beaten with iron rods. 410 418 Then the prince-like one O father,
listen to what is known to us O father, we have reached the end Going to such a
transformation, with such, even this princess, where? The seventeen women told

with her, with betel, fragrance, garlands, etc. Drinking the coppery and muddy
(water). Who are the learned ones, with the speed of horses, and the wind from
the palm trees. Hearing the sweet sound, and the loud and terrible sound. When
Shreshthika returned. It is doubtful, O lord. For a moment, with the
thunderbolt-like leg, for a moment, hearing the destruction, tying the
equipment, abandoning the mind for a moment. Reaching the topic, on the top of

hopes were seen. It becomes for the people. Arrived by the order of Rama.
Knowing the details, the heroic Lakshmana, they went to the garden to play,

goddesses. Disregarding the glory completely. Some human being, sideways,

stand alone in distress. Though extremely ordered, as it is. The multitude of
horses and elephants, mature. The horses are sometimes brilliant. Mounted on the
horse-drawn chariot, the gods Kama are pleased with the qualities of
satisfaction, etc. On the great mountain of the bow and arrow. Let the sounds of
musical instruments resound. Like grass, the glory of the sky-goers. Is not
satisfied with the tips. Thirsty with the utmost thirst. The thirst of the
wolves, the thirst of the reeds. Thirsty, destroyed.

Translated to English, preserving Jain terms:  Crowded with people from various
regions Filled with people from various regions Glittering with various lotus
filaments Resounding with various terrible noises Engaged in various great wars
Afflicted by various kinds of miseries Surrounded by various devotees Adorned
with various ornaments Wearing garments of various colors Delighted by the sound
of various musical instruments Afflicted by various diseases and old age Engaged
in hundreds of various activities Disturbed by the cries of various birds
Mounted on various vehicles 161 348 Wandering in various wombs, shining with
various jewels 214 65 10 Adorned with various jewels, shining with various
beautiful jewels, bodies shining with various jewels - 354, bodies shining with
various jewels - 382, bodies shining with various jewels and gold 402 Though
endowed with various attainments Waving various colored flags Overwhelmed by
various weapons Seeing various equipment Our names are Narayana Names of the
capital cities Narayana's sons, and Narayana is also there Narayana also, in the
same way Narayana also, the gentle-souled one, Narayana or another The army of
the enemies could not be tolerated Though he is not born from the womb of a king
Not going out at night for food, sleep or urination - this kingdom is free from
all obstacles, free from all attachments Those who have attained the highest
good Sighing deeply and hotly Filled with the fragrance of exhalation Abandoning
the community, becoming detached Completely detached from great flesh By the
absence of ownership and immutability, the action is purified by the person Even
if the enemy is close, he is not seen Heaviness in the hips due to the union of
women and men Some fruits of the hips Extremely difficult to bear The mind
polluted by the root cause Bound by the chain of the root cause O king, give up
sleep By their falling and flying Even for a moment he is not Controlled by good
conduct Rejected by Sita, gone far away Observing the mad one The breath without
heat, the sweat Someone found the beloved who had gone out Whose greatness of
the sage is not known

456 He was in Podan. He was powerful. He was seen. By the weapon of Barhana. By
the grace of Baldeva. Then Baldeva said. The good deeds of Baldeva. People
again. The strong ones have risen. Due to the excess of strength. Many called
Padma-nabha. Many of the people's opinions. Many other capitals. Many are his
births. Defeating the enemies outside. The king who is not to be trusted
outside. In the remaining hopes outside. Very much criticized. What is the use
of speaking in many ways? He who carries the dust of many flowers. With hundreds
of very pleasing hymns. With many forms. Well known. Ravana was forced to do it.
The lower eyes are being forced. This is not the war. A small fault. Taking
shelter in the shadow of the arm. The collision of the arm and the head. Even
though he is adorned with the outer ornaments of the club of Vasudamini. Outer
gardens and stupas. He does not fear death. The greatest joy in confusion. The
three-bodied one praises the supreme Lakshmi. The three-fold wealth. The three-
crystal construction. He is carrying the supreme Lakshmi. They are carrying the
beautiful armor.  107 362 266 60 284 204 421 77 344 137 112 251 171 171 405 324

225 In the Padma Purana. He is carrying the pure garland. The seed is placed on
the stone. The end of the Buddha-self. Like bubbles. The reflection of the
bubble-mirror. The jewel of Samadhi. Large, diverse musical instruments. Even in
the human world. Having attained enlightenment. Kakutstha says this to you. The
Brahma-Brahma-uttar world. The form of the Brahma-world. The Brahmin Soma-deva.
Speaking. They say there is no thirst for me. What is this name? Tell me. Tell
me the reason for this. Tell me, tell me, what is your wish? Tell me, tell me,
who is the beloved? All the deities. [ Devotion to the master is supreme. By the
proximity created by devotion. With many kinds of food. Lord, I want to know.
Lord, by Padma-nabha. Lord, the lowest, the middle. Lord, it is said. The object
desired by the Lord. The Lord, the king of men. The Lord, Baldeva. The broken
vajra-door. The praise of the devotees. Enjoy the kingdom without thorns. Enjoy
the gift that is not slippery. They are being told again. They are free from
doubt. Good, your form. Good, the forest-born. 16 237 6 211 411 The body is
moist with the thought of the Lord. 334 The salutations offered with feeling.
