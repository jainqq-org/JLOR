The revered Shri Suvrata Muni 'Satyarthī Shāstrī M.A. (Hindi-Sanskrit), a highly
respected scholar, a master of truth, an enlightened sage, a treasure trove of
Āgama knowledge, a supreme Shramaṇa, and the late Yuvacharya Shri Mishrīmalji M.
'Madhukar' ji, was the undisputed authority on ancient knowledge. Under his
guidance and as the chief editor, the great Shruta-yajña of Jain Āgama
publication began, which saw the publication of Shri Prāchārāṅga,
Uttarādhyayana, Vyākhyāprajñapti, and Upāsakadaśāṅga sūtras, by the grace of the
Guru. The contemporary language and style of the Āgamas, along with their
comparative analysis and interpretation, are extremely laborious. The research-
based introductions, essential footnotes, and appendices have made the Āgamas
accessible to both general and specialized readers, and are extremely useful for
modern research methods. The beautiful and pure printing of all the sūtras, the
excellent paper and cover, are very attractive. The publication of 30 massive
Āgamas in a very short time is a significant contribution. The credit for this
goes to the founder of the Shruta-yajña, the Āgama-expert, the revered
Yuvacharya Shri ji M. However, all the revered Gurus, the Saadhvi-vrinda, and
the Sad-grihasthas who have contributed to this great Shruta-yajña are
commendable and praiseworthy. The Āgama Publication Committee deserves special
congratulations. For Private & Personal use only

We are experiencing joy in presenting the 30th volume of the Prakashkiy Shri
Jinagam-Granthamala, 'Jivajivaabhigam (First Volume)' to the loving readers of
Agam. The presented Sutra is vast and requires detailed discussion due to its
theoretical description. Without doing so, inquisitive readers cannot be fully
satisfied. Keeping this vision in mind, learned Muni Shri Rajendra Muniji has
done a sufficiently detailed discussion. This has made it very convenient for
the readers to understand the heart of the Sutra, but it has also increased its
size. Even so, we had planned to print it in a single volume, but due to some
adverse circumstances, we are forced to publish it in two volumes. This will
also be an advantage as it will be more convenient for readers to carry and keep
with them during travel. Efforts will be made to publish the second volume of
the presented Sutra as soon as possible. Shri Rajendra Muniji is a distinguished
scholar and researcher of the Agams, as well as a writer of the highest caliber.
This is natural because he is the disciple of distinguished enlightened
Munirajas like Upadhyaya Shri Pushkar Muniji M. and Upadhyay Shri Devendra
Muniji M. Editing and discussing Jivajivaabhigam is not an easy task, yet
Munishri accepted our request and took up this great laborious task and
completed it in a short time, we do not have words to express our gratitude for
this. We have received invaluable cooperation from the great Saraswati devotee
Upadhyay Shri Devendra Muniji M., who is constantly engaged in the propagation
of Jinvani, since the beginning of the Granthamala publication. It can be said
without a doubt that if we had not received the support of Upadhyay Shri, the
publication work would not have been possible at the speed at which it has been
done. You have benefited us by writing a scholarly introduction to the presented
Sutra. The work of editing and revising Pragambattisi is complete. The
publication of the Cheda Sutras was stopped due to the need to print the second
edition of Pracharang and Upasakadashang in between. Now they have been sent to
the press. Panditraj Shri Kanhaiyalalji M. 'Kamal', the propagator of Pragam-
Anuyog, has put in a lot of effort and taken interest in the editing etc. of the
Cheda Sutras. We cannot be indebted to your kindness. We are grateful to all
those great people who have contributed and are contributing to this great work.

**Editorial Statement**  The nectar-like, pre-scriptural pronouncements of the
omniscient, all-seeing, dispassionate Supreme Being, the Jinesvara Devas, are
not only a priceless treasure of the world's religious literature, but also a
life-saving elixir for the lives of all beings. This discourse, as prescribed by
the worthy ones, is that pot of nectar which removes all poisons and
afflictions, and bestows new life upon all beings in the world. The origin of
the Jain Agamas is for the sake of compassion, in the form of protection of the
world's beings. Non-violence, compassion, kindness, affection, and friendship
are its essence. Therefore, it is the most beneficial, protective, and helpful
for the world's beings. This Jain discourse is a form of salvation, refuge,
momentum, and foundation for all beings.  The ancient teachers have compared
this pre-scriptural pronouncements to the ocean. They said, "This Jain Agama is
like a great ocean. It is boundless in knowledge, filled to the brim with the
best words, and vast in extent due to the waves of endless non-violence. The
tide of the ocean is rising in it, it is filled with jewels obtained through the
grace of the Guru, and it is difficult to cross. It is the ultimate essence and
auspiciousness. One should worship this ocean of the primary form of the
Mahavira Supreme Being with devotion."  Indeed, the Jain Agama is vast and
profound like the ocean. However, with the grace of the Guru and effort, one can
dive into it and obtain the essential jewels. The essence of Jain discourse is
non-violence and equality. As stated in the Sutra Kritanga Sutra, "To consider
all beings as oneself and not to harm them, this is the essence of religion, the
path to self-welfare." Jain principles are imbued with non-violence, and in the
world burning with the fire of violence, the endless stream of non-violence is
beneficial. Therefore, the study, practice, and widespread dissemination of Jain
principles is the primary need of the present age. Only through the practice of
non-violence is there a possibility of world peace, therefore, the study and
practice of the Jain Agamas, which are imbued with non-violence, is paramount.
The Jain Agamas are in the form of the twelve-part Ganipitaka. After attaining
omniscience, the Arhant Tirthankara Supreme Being, in essence, formulates the
discourse, and their fourteen predecessors, the wise and knowledgeable
Ganadharas, bind them in the form of sutras.  **Sutra-vyakarana Sutra 1:**  1.
For the protection and compassion of all beings in the world, the Bhagavan has
spoken. 2. Boundless in knowledge, with a path of excellent words, beautiful
with water, with waves of non-violence, it is vast in extent. The tide is
rising, it is filled with jewels obtained from the Guru, and it is difficult to
cross. The essence is the ocean of the pre-scriptural pronouncements, worship it
with devotion. 3. Know that non-violence and time are the limits.

This is the tradition of preaching that continues. The originator of the Artha-
rupa Pragama is the Tirthankara, the Supreme Being, and the originator of the
Shabda-rupa Pragama is the Ganadhara. / The tradition of the Mahant and their
Ganadharas has been going on for an infinite time. Therefore, the tradition of
their teachings, the Pragama, has been going on since the beginning of time.
That is why it is said that this Dvadasangi is Dhruva, Nitya, Shashwat, it has
always been. It was never not, it is never not, it will never not be... that is
also not the case. / It always was, is, and always will be. In terms of
feelings, it is Dhruva, Nitya, Shashwat. The Dvadasangi includes twelve Angas.
Pracharang, Sutra-kritang, Stanang, Samavayang, Vyakhya-Prajnapti,
Jnatadharmakatha, Upasakadasha, Antakrid Dasha, Anuropapatik, Prashnavyakaran,
Vipaksutra and Drishtivad. / These are the twelve Angas. This is the Dvadasangi
Ganipitaka, which is directly taught by the Tirthankaras. This is called Anga-
pravist Pragama. / In addition, the Ananga-pravist Anga-bahir Pragama are those
that have been composed by the learned elders who are endowed with Prajnatishya,
in a way that is not contradictory to the words of the Tirthankaras. Thus, the
Jain Agam is divided into two parts - Anga-pravist and Ananga-pravist (Anga-
bahir). / The present Jiva-abhigam Shastra is Ananga-pravist Agam. From another
perspective, the twelve Angas are also called twelve Upangas. Accordingly,
Aushapatik etc. are given the name Upanga. Acharya Malayagiri, who wrote a
detailed commentary on Jiva-abhigam, has called it the Upanga of the third Anga
- Stanang. In the beginning of the present Jiva-abhigam Sutra, the learned
elders are presented as the model for this study. That passage is as follows:
'Ih Khalu Jinamya Jinanumaya, Jinanuloma Jinappaniya Jinapparuviya Jinakhaya
Jinanuchinna Jinapganatta Jinadesiya Jinapasattha Anuveeya Tam Saddhamana Tam
Pattiyamana Tam Royamana Yera Bhagavanta Jiwa Jivaabhigamanamjayanam Pannavansu
/ ' 'Having contemplated this excellent Jinamat, which is approved by all the
Jineshwars, Jinanuloma, Jinapranit, Jinaprarupit, Jinakhyat, Jinanuchirna Jin-
prajnapta and Jindeshit, and having faith, belief and interest in it, the
learned elders have formulated the study called Jiva-abhigam. The above
statement makes it clear that the present Sutra has been composed by the learned
elders. Those learned elders were the true knowers of the teachings of the
Tirthankaras. They had faith, belief and interest in their words. This implies
that the Pragama formulated by such learned elders is also as authoritative as
the Agam formulated by the omniscient, all-seeing Tirthankara. / Because the
composition of the learned elders is not contradictory to the words of the
Tirthankaras. The explanation of the special qualities of Jinamat that appear in
the present text has been given in the discussion of the original text. The
present Sutra is called Jiva-abhigam, but because it mainly deals with the Jiva,
or from a concise perspective, this Sutra is also known as 'Jiva-abhigam'. 1.

---------------------------
Jain philosophy is primarily **ātmavādī** (soul-centric). The **jīva** (soul) is
its central point. Although Jain doctrine has recognized nine **tattvas**
(principles) or seven **tattvas** by including **puṇya** (merit), **pāpa**
(demerit), **prāsrava** (influx), **bandha** (bond) in one principle, all of
them are merely different states of the relationship or separation of the
**jīva** and **ajīva** (non-soul) **karma-dravya** (matter of karma). The
purpose of describing the **ajīva** principle is to clarify the nature of the
**jīva** principle and to distinguish it from its different nature. **Puṇya**,
**pāpa**, **prāsrava**, **samvara** (restriction), **nirjarā** (efflux),
**bandha**, and **mokṣa** (liberation) are states that arise from the union and
separation of the **jīva** and **karma**. Therefore, it can be said that the
root of Jain philosophy is **ātma-dravya** (soul-matter). Its beginning is
**ātma-vicāra** (self-reflection) and its ultimate culmination is **mokṣa**.
This **sūtra** (text) discusses the **ātma-dravya**, i.e., the **jīva**, in
detail. Therefore, it is called **jīvābhigama** (approach to the soul).
**Abhigama** means knowledge. That which provides knowledge of the **jīva** and
**ajīva** is **jīvābhigama**. After generally mentioning the distinctions of the
**ajīva** principle, the entire purpose of this **sūtra** is to focus on the
**jīva** principle. The **jīva** is divided into two categories: **siddh**
(liberated) and **saṁsāra-samāpannaka** (bound to the cycle of existence).
Subsequently, the **sūtra** discusses the various distinctions of **saṁsāra-
samāpannaka** **jīvas** in terms of nine **pratipattis** (perspectives). These
nine **pratipattis** are presented from different perspectives, and therefore,
despite being different, they are not contradictory and are factual. These nine
**pratipattis** describe how the **jīva**, transformed by the **vibhāva**
(causes) of **rāga** (attachment), **dveṣa** (aversion), etc., experiences
various states, forms, births, deaths, etc., in the world. They describe the
**jīvātmā** (soul) experiencing various states as **sa-sthāvara** (with a body),
as **strī** (female), **puruṣa** (male), **napumsaka** (neuter), as **nārak**
(hell being), **tiryañc** (animal), **manuṣya** (human), and **deva** (god), as
having one sense to five senses, as having an earth body to a **trasa-kāya**
(body of the **trasa**), and as experiencing birth and death in various other
forms from other perspectives. The **dvi-vidha** (two-fold) **pratipatti**
describes the distinctions of **jīvas** as **sa-sthāvara** through 23 **dvāras**
(gates): 1) **śarīra** (body), 2) **avagāhanā** (perception), 3) **saṁhanana**
(concentration), 4) **saṁsthāna** (structure), 5) **kaṣāya** (passions), 6)
**saṁjñā** (consciousness), 7) **leśyāḥ** (subtle karmic tendencies), 8)
**indriya** (sense organs), 9) **samudghāta** (awakening), 10) **saṁjñī-
asaṁjñī** (conscious-unconscious), 11) **veda** (knowledge), 12) **paryāpti-
aparyāpti** (sufficient-insufficient), 13) **dṛṣṭi** (view), 14) **darśana**
(perception), 15) **jñāna** (knowledge), 16) **yoga** (concentration), 17)
**upayoga** (application), 18) **prāhāra** (intake), 19) **upapāta**
(occurrence), 20) **sthiti** (state), 21) **samavahata-prasamavahata** (flowing-
non-flowing), 22) **cyavana** (decay), and 23) **gati-prāgati** (motion-
progress). Similarly, the other **pratipattis** also describe the various
distinctions of the **jīva** through different **dvāras**. The **dvāras** of
**sthiti** (state), **saṁciṭaṇā** (accumulation), **antara** (difference), and
**pralpa-bahutva** (few-many) are mentioned as much as possible throughout. The
final **pratipatti** does not distinguish between **siddh** and **saṁsārī**
(bound to the cycle of existence) but describes the distinctions of all
**jīvas**. This **sūtra** describes **adholoka** (lower world), **tiryak loka**
(intermediate world), and **ūrvāloka** (upper world) in the context of
**nārak**, **tiryañc**, **manuṣya**, and **deva**. The description of **tiryak
loka** includes the mention of islands and oceans, the mention of **karma-
bhūmi** (land of karma) and **akarma-bhūmi** (land of no karma), and a detailed
discussion of the geographical and cultural conditions there, which is
significant from various perspectives. Thus, this **sūtra** and its subject
matter provide detailed information about the **jīva**, therefore, its name
**jīvābhigama** is meaningful. This **abhigama** is an important part of Jain
philosophy. The original source of this **sūtra** is a **grantha** (text) of
6750 **granthānas** (units of measurement). **Ācārya** (teacher) **Malayagiri**
wrote a commentary on it with 14000 **granthānas**, revealing the essence of
this profound **abhigama**. The commentator, with his intellectual brilliance,
has illuminated the essence of the **abhigama** for us ordinary people,
benefiting us greatly. Regarding the edition, the main source of the original

This is the original text of the Jivaabhigaman Sutra with commentary, but in
many places the published text differs from the commentary. This difference
suggests that the commentator had access to a different (ideal) manuscript.
Therefore, in many places we have adopted the commentator's version as the
original text, as it seemed more appropriate. Such variations are noted in
footnotes. The commentator himself mentions that there are differences in the
seven chapters of this Praagam. It is important to remember that these
differences are in the words, not the meaning. There is no difference in the
essence, only in the words and their order. In such places, we have adopted the
commentator's version as the original text. The commentary by Acharya Shri
Malayagiri has been the main basis for the translation and analysis of this
Praagam. We have made every effort to present the theoretical content of this
important text in a clear and concise manner for the benefit of the inquisitive
reader. Therefore, we have included in the analysis almost all the main points
clarified in the commentary, so that those who do not understand Sanskrit can
also benefit from them. I believe that this effort will enable Hindi-speaking
readers to understand all the essential points explained in the commentary in
Sanskrit. From this perspective, the usefulness of this edition is greatly
enhanced. If the inquisitive reader benefits from this, I will consider my
efforts worthwhile. Finally, I consider myself fortunate to have had the
opportunity to prepare this edition. The Praagam Prakashan Samiti, Byawar,
entrusted me with the responsibility of editing the Jivaabhigaman Sutra
presented here. Considering the seriousness of the Sutra, I was certainly
hesitant about my own competence, but inspired by devotion to the scriptures, I
accepted this responsibility and dedicated myself to its execution. Whatever I
could do is presented before the readers in this form. Acknowledgement - In this
effort of mine to serve the scriptures, I have received the skillful guidance
and direction of the venerable Guru Shri Pushkarmuniji Maharaj and the Upadhyay
of the Shraman Sangh, the literary sage, the renowned writer Shri Devendra
Muniji Maharaj, as a result of which I have been able to complete this Herculean
task. I am eternally grateful to these revered Gurus. The venerable Upadhyay
Shri has also had the great kindness to write a scholarly introduction to this
Praagam. This has added to the usefulness of this edition. While editing this
Praagam, I received significant assistance from the renowned scholar of the Jain
community, Pandit Shri Basantlalji Nalvaya of Ratlam. I cannot forget to express
my gratitude for his scholarly and dedicated assistance. I am primarily grateful
to the Seth Devanand Lalbhai Pustak Uddhar Fund, Surat, whose published edition
has been used in this work. I express my heartfelt gratitude to the Praagam
Prakashan Samiti, Byawar, and all other direct and indirect contributors.

the hearts of all people may be filled with faith, belief, and interest in the

**Introduction**  Jiva-Jiva-Abhigham: A Critical Study is a precious jewel-
casket in the Jain Agam world. If we consider it from the perspective of the
world's religious and philosophical literature, its place becomes even more
dignified and glorious. In the vast expanse of religious and philosophical
literature, Jain Agams and Jain literature occupy the same place as the moon and
the sun among countless twinkling stars and constellations. Without Jain
literature, the light of world literature is dim and dull. Western thinkers like
Dr. Hermann Jacobi, Dr. Schubing, etc., also unanimously accept the truth that
the Jain Agams have a beautiful harmony of philosophy and life, conduct and
thought, emotion and duty, which is rare in other literature.  Jain Agams are an
inexhaustible treasury of knowledge and science. It is as vast as its literal
form, but its subtle and profound contemplation is even more expansive and
great. The Jain Agams have declared the soul to be an eternal entity and have
shown it the path of supreme purity. Along with this, they have propounded the
holy confluence of right knowledge, right faith, and right conduct as its means.
They have inspired the attainment of the ultimate peak and supreme excellence of
life through the worship of renunciation, detachment, and self-control. They
have revealed the eternal truth of life. Not only have they revealed it, but
they have also made it practicable and applicable in conduct.  By the power of
their practice, the proponents of the Jain Agams first recognized the truth
themselves, knew the reality, and then they modeled the truth. Therefore, their
thinking has the element of experience. It is not a flight of fancy, but an
experiential reality-based thinking. The realistic and detached Jineshwars had a
direct experience of the true essence and modeled it for the welfare of the
beings of the world. This modeling and description is the Jain Agam. Being
modeled by the realistic and truthful, it is true, unquestionable, and being a
received word, it is Agam. Those who have conquered attachment and aversion are
Jins, Tirthankaras, omniscient Lords, and their teachings and words are the Jain
Agams. Because in them, due to the speaker's realistic vision and detachment,
there is no possibility of fault, nor is there any contradiction or logical
fallacy.  **Origin of Jain Agams**  Regarding the origin of the Jain Agams, Shri
Bhadrabahu Swami has said in Praavshak Niyukti and Shri Jinbhadra Ganik
Shamaashraman in Vishesh Avshayak Bhashya:  1. Sanvjagajivarakkhanadayattyaye
paavayanam bhagavaya sukahyam / 2. Tamev saccham nisshank janjinehi paveiyam /
3. Praaptavachanaadavirbhatamarthasanvedanamaagam: / Pramannaytatvalok [11]

The omniscient, liberated Kevalis, who have ascended the tree of austerities,
rules, and knowledge, shower down knowledge-flowers to enlighten the masses. The
Ganadharas receive them in a vessel of intellect and use them to compose
sermons. They preach the meaning and the Ganadharas skillfully weave them into
sutras. Thus, sutras are established for the benefit of the Dharma. The
Tirthankaras are the originators of the meaningful texts. Acharya Devavachana
has therefore called the scriptures as Tirthankara-created. Enlightened readers
should remember that the authenticity of the Agam literature is not only due to
its creation by the Ganadharas, but also because of the Tirthankara's freedom
from passions and omniscience, who are the formulators of the meaning. The
Ganadharas only compose the twelve Angas. The Staviras compose the external
scriptures. Acharya Malayagiri and others believe that the Ganadharas ask the
Tirthankaras about the essence of reality. In response, the Tirthankaras utter
the three-line verse "Uppanṇā i vā vigamei vā dhūvei vā". This three-line verse
is called "Mataka-pada" because the Ganadharas compose the twelve Angas based on
it. This twelve-Anga form of the pre-Agam literature is expanded as the Anga-
included. All the remaining compositions are external to the Angas. The twelve
Angas are born from the three-line verse, therefore they are created by the
Ganadharas. It should also be remembered that not all compositions created by
the Ganadharas are Angas. Compositions created through free grammar in the
absence of the three-line verse, even if created by Ganadharas or Staviras, are
considered external to the Angas. There are two types of Staviras -
Chaturdashapurvi and Dashapurvi. They are complete knowers of the Anga
literature in terms of sutras and meaning. Whatever they compose or say, there
is no contradiction whatsoever. Acharya Sanghadas Gani believes that what a
Tirthankara can say, a Shrutakevali can also say in the same way. The only
difference is that the Kevali knows the entire truth directly, while the
Shrutakevali knows it indirectly through scriptural knowledge. Their words are
also authentic because they are always right-sighted. They always follow the
path of scriptural preaching. Their proclamation is that this scriptural
preaching is true, without doubt, this is the meaning, the ultimate truth, the
rest is meaningless. Therefore, there is no possibility of contradictory facts
in the texts composed by them. Their statements are not contradictory to the
twelve Angas. Therefore, the texts composed by them are also considered
authentic like the Agam.

The earliest classification of the Purvas and Angas in Jain Agamas is found in
the Samavayanga Sutra, where the number of Purvas is mentioned as fourteen and
the number of Angas as twelve. There are two traditions of knowledge in Jain
literature: Purvadhara and Dvadashaangaveta. Purvadharas have a higher position
in terms of knowledge. The ascetics who possessed the knowledge of the fourteen
Purvas were called Shrutakevali. The Purvas contained a detailed discussion of
all objects and subjects, therefore their extent and evidence was very vast and
profound. No good thing was left untouched by the scope of the Purvas. There are
different opinions of scholars regarding the composition of the Purvas.
According to the opinion of Acharya Abhaydeva and others, the Purva literature
was composed before the Dvadashaangi. This is why it is called Purva. Some
thinkers believe that the Purvas are the collection of scriptures from the
tradition of Lord Parshvanath. Due to the subject matter of the Purvas being
very serious, difficult and inaccessible, it was only useful for specific
क्षयोपशमधारियों. In order to make the subject useful for ordinary people, the
Angas were composed. As stated in the Visheshaavashyak Bhashya, "Although there
is a complete revelation of knowledge in the Bhutvad or Drishtivad, but for the
benefit of people with limited intellect, the rest of the scriptures were
extracted from it, and on the basis of that, the entire literature was created."
Currently, the Purvas are not considered separate from the Dvadashaangi.
Drishtivad is the twelfth Anga. Until the creation of the Pracharang and other
Anga literature, the entire collection of scriptures was known as Purva or
Drishtivad. When the Angas were created, Drishtivad was given a place as the
twelfth Anga after the eleven Angas including Pracharang. In Agama literature,
there is a description of both types of ascetics who read the twelve Angas and
those who read the fourteen Purvas, but both refer to the same thing. Those who
were Chaturdashapurvi were also Dvadashaangavit because the twelfth Anga itself
contains the fourteen Purvas. The second classification of Agamas is done as
Angapravesh and Angabahya. Angapravesh: Angabahya Acharya Jinabhadragani
Kshamasraman, while analyzing Angapravesh and Angabahya, said: 1. Chaudasapubya
pannatta tam jaha - Uppayapubba............tah vindusar. 2. (a) Prathama purva

**Angpravist Shrut** is that which (1) is composed in the form of sutras by the
Ganadharas, (2) is propounded by the Tirthankaras when questioned by the
Ganadharas, (3) is eternal and long-lasting due to its relation to eternal
truths. In this regard, it is said that the Dvadasanga Ganipitaka was never, is
not, will never be, and will never be. It was, is, and will be. It is eternal,
fixed, everlasting, imperishable, unchanging, existing, and constant.
**Angbahya Shrut** is that which (1) is established, (2) is propounded by the
Tirthankaras without being questioned, (3) is universal, i.e., it is present in
the Tirtha of all Tirthankaras. This is not the case, for example, with the
Tandulavaicharik etc. chapters.  The commentator of the Nandi Sutra, Acharya
Malayagiri, while explaining Angpravist and Angbahya, wrote: "The fundamental
sutras composed by the Ganadharas, who are endowed with the most excellent
knowledge of the Shrut, which are completely fixed, are the Angpravist Shrut
like the Pracharanga etc. Other Shrut, composed by the Sthaviras, are the
Angbahya Shrut."  Angbahya is of two types: **Aavashyak** and
**Aavashyakvyatirikt**.  Aavashyakvyatirikt Shrut is of two types: (1) **Kalik**
and (2) **Utkalik**.  The Shrut that is read in the first and last prahar of the
night and day is **Kalik** Shrut, and that which can be read at any time by
ringing the time bell is **Utkalik** Shrut. The Nandi Sutra mentions the names
of Kalik and Utkalik sutras.  The most recent classification of Ang, Upang, Mul,
and Chhed Agamas is: Ang, Upang, Mul, and Chhed.  The Nandi Sutra does not use
the term Upang, nor does it mention Mul and Chhed. There, the term Angbahya is
found in the sense of Upang.  Acharya Shrichand, whose time is considered to be
before 1112 AD, composed the Sukhabodha Samachari. In it, he used the term
"Upang" in the sense of Angbahya while describing the tapasvidhi of the study of
the Agamas. The term Upang is also used in the Chandi literature.  The division
of Mul and Chhed sutras cannot be said to have been established from the
beginning.  The Pravacharcharit, composed in Vikram Samvat 1334, first mentions
the division of Ang, Upang, Mul, and Chhed. The implication is that this
division had already taken place in the latter half of the 13th century.  There
is no consensus on the number and names of Mul and Chhed sutras.  Regarding the
number of Ang literature, the Svetambaras and Digambaras are of one mind. They
all accept twelve Angs. However, there are different opinions on the number of
Angbahya Pragama.  The Svetambara Murtipujakas accept 45 Pragama, while the
Sthanakvasi and Terapanthi accept 32 Agamas.  The Svetambara Murtipujakas
consider 11 Ang, 12 Upang, 6 Mul sutras, 6 Chhed sutras, and 10 Painna - thus 45
Pragama - as authoritative. According to the Sthanakvasi and Terapanthi, 11 Ang,
12 Upang, 4 Mul sutras, 4 Chhed sutras, and 1 Praavashyak sutra - thus 32 - are
considered authoritative at present.  **Jivajivoabhigam** - The Jivajivoabhigam
Sutra presented here, according to the above classification, is Upang Shrut and
Kalik Sutra:  1. Ganahar-therakayam va paesa mukkavagaranpo va / ghav-

This is mentioned in the commentary by Acharya Malayagiri, who calls it an
Upanga of the third Anga, the "Sthananga".  He describes the importance of this
Pragama, saying that this Upanga, called "Jivajivaabhigam", is like a supreme
mantra for removing the poison of attachment, like water for extinguishing the
fire of hatred, like the sun for destroying the darkness of ignorance, and like
a bridge for crossing the ocean of existence. It is attainable through great
effort and possesses the infallible power to attain liberation. The
aforementioned descriptions by the commentator clearly highlight the importance
of this Pragama. The first sutra of this Agama mentions the Stavira Bhagavants
as its promulgators, stating: "Those Stavira Bhagavants, having thoroughly
examined the principles embodied in the Tirthankaras, with their unique wisdom,
and having deep faith, affection, interest, conviction, and profound belief in
them, have formulated the study of Jivas and Ajivas." This statement expresses
that the Stavira Bhagavants are the originators of this Pragama. Whatever those
Staviras have said is indeed said by the Jinesvara Devas, is sanctioned by them,
is formulated by them, is embodied by them, is declared by them, is established
by them, is proclaimed by them, is taught by them, is as smooth and beneficial
as a path, and is a Pragama that, through tradition, grants attainment of
Jinahood. Although the words of this Pragama are spoken by the Stavira
Bhagavants, its meaning is taught by the Tirthankaras, making it as
authoritative as the Dvadasanga. Thus, the authenticity of this Pragama is
revealed. The authenticity of the Upanga Shrutis lies in their conformity with
the Anga Shrutis. The Shruti is imagined as a person. Just as a person has limbs
and appendages, the Shruti-person is also recognized as having twelve Angas and
twelve Upangas. The two feet, two shanks, two thighs, the front and back parts
of the body (chest and back), two arms, the neck, and the head are considered
the twelve limbs of a person. Similarly, the Shruti-person has twelve Angas,
starting with the Pracharanga. Just as there are appendages to assist the limbs,
the Upanga Shrutis are established as auxiliary and supplementary. Twelve
Upangas are recognized for the twelve Angas. In the Vedic tradition, the
Vedangas and Upangas are also recognized as auxiliary or supplementary to the
Vedas, known as Shiksha, Vyakarana, Chanda, Nirukta, Jyotish, and Kalpa.
Puranas, Nyaya, Mimamsa, and Dharmashastras are also accepted as Upangas. There
is a need for coherence in the subject matter of the Angas and Upangas, which is
not clearly evident. This is a matter that must be considered by scholars. The
name of this sutra is Jivajivaabhigam, but due to the concise presentation of
Ajivas and the detailed presentation of Jivas, it is known as "Jivaabhigam". It
discusses the differences and distinctions between Jivas and Ajivas in the form
of questions and answers between Bhagavan Mahavira and Ganadhara Gautam. From a
traditional perspective, this Pragama had 20 Uddesakas. 1. This is the Pragama
called Jivajivaabhigam, which is like a supreme mantra for removing the poison
of attachment, like water for extinguishing the fire of hatred, like the sun for
destroying the darkness of ignorance, and like a bridge for crossing the ocean
of existence. It is attainable through great effort and possesses the infallible
power to attain liberation. - Malayagiri Vritti 2. The Theras Bhagavants,
following the path, accepting, and praising this, which is Jina-made, Jina-
particle-made, Jina-particle-like, Jina-formulated, Jina-embodied, Jina-
declared, Jina-marked, Jina-sanctioned, Jina-taught, and Jina-beneficial, have
expounded the Jivajivaabhigam. - Jiva. Sutra 1 [ 15 ]

And the twentieth Uddeshak was explained by Shri Chandrasuri, the disciple of
Shri Shalibhadrasuri. Shri Abhaydev wrote Sangrahni on its third pada. However,
in its present form, it has only nine pratipattis (chapters) which are divided
into 272 sutras. It is possible that a significant part of this Maagam has been
lost, and the remaining part has been compiled into nine pratipattis. The
available edition has 9 pratipattis, one adhyayan, 18 uddeshak, 4750 shloka
praman text, 272 gadyasutra and 81 padya (gatha). The famous Vrittikar Shri
Malayagiri wrote a Vritti on it. He mentioned the difference in readings at many
places in his Vritti. The original text given in the edition of Jivaabhigam
published by Pragamoday Samiti has differences in places from the manuscript
that was in front of the Vrittikar, which the Vrittikar himself has mentioned at
various places. An attempt has been made to mention such differences in readings
at various places in the discussion and commentary of the present edition. It is
to be remembered here that even though there are differences in words, there is
usually no difference in meaning. Here, an important point to consider is that
the description of Shruta literature given in Shruta texts like Nandi Sutra etc.
is not available in the present time. Much of the vast Shruta literature
mentioned in it has been lost and much has also been changed. The form and
quantity of Shruta at the time of Bhagwan Mahavira gradually decreased due to
famine etc., due to the defects of time and due to the decline of wisdom and
brilliance. From time to time, readings of Praagams have been done to protect
the remaining Shruta. It will not be irrelevant to give a brief description of
them here. Readings have been done for the collection of Praagams after the
Parinirvana of Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira. Five readings have been done for the
collection of Praagams. The first reading - 160 years after the Nirvana of Veer,
in Pataliputra. A severe famine of twelve years fell and the Shruta became
fragmented. Many Bahushratadhar Shramanas perished in the jaws of time. Many
other obstacles also created obstacles in the proper transmission of sutras. The
beads of Praagam knowledge became scattered. After the famine ended, the
distinguished Acharyas who were present at that time gathered in Pataliputra. A
systematic collection of eleven Angas was done. The only knower of the twelfth
Dristivad, Bhadrabahu Swami, was practicing Mahapran-Dhyan in Nepal at that
time. At the request of the Sangha, he agreed to give the reading of the twelfth
Anga. Muni Sthulabhadra received the reading with prayers till the tenth Purva.
The reading of the eleventh Purva was going on when Muni Sthulabhadra showed a
miracle to the sisters by taking the form of a lion. Due to which Bhadrabahu
stopped giving further readings. After that, at the repeated persuasion of the
Sangha and Sthulabhadra, Bhadrabahu gave the reading of the last four Purvas
from the original, not from the meaning. From the literal point of view,
Sthulabhadra became fourteen Purvi, but from the point of view of meaning, he
remained ten Purvi. 1. Ih Bhuyaan Pustakeshu Vaachanaabhedo Galitaani Cha

The second attempt to compile the second *vachana-pragam* took place in the
middle of the 2nd century BCE. Emperor Kharavela was a devout follower of
Jainism. His famous *Hathigumpha* inscription proves that he had called a
congregation of Jain monks on the Kumari mountain in Odisha and had revived the
*angas* that had been forgotten during the Mauryan period. The Sanskrit-Prakrit
mixed *pattavali* called *Himvant Theravali* also clearly mentions that Maharaja
Kharavela had revived the *pravacana*.  The third attempt to compile the
*pragams* of the third *vachana* took place between 827 and 840 CE. At that
time, a severe twelve-year famine made it difficult for the monks to receive
alms. The situation of the *shraman* community became critical. Young monks
traveled far and wide in search of pure food. Many elderly and learned monks
died due to the effects of food deprivation. How could the monks engage in
study, teaching, memorization, and recitation while suffering from hunger? All
activities were disrupted. Gradually, the *shruta* began to decline. The
*shruta* was almost completely lost. A large part of the *anga* and *upaanga*
literature was also lost in terms of meaning. After the famine ended, the
*shraman* community gathered in Mathura under the leadership of *Skandilācārya*.
They compiled a portion of the *kalika shruta* and the *purvagata shruta* based
on whatever they could remember. This *vachana* was completed in Mathura and
became known as the *Mathuri Vachana*. *Acharya Skandil* provided the meaning of
the compiled *shruta*, so this *anuyoga* came to be known as the *Skandilī
Vachana*. According to the *Chandi* and *Vatti* of the *Nandi Sutta*, except for
a small amount of *shruta-jnana*, all the *anuyoga-dhara* monks had passed away
due to the famine. To this end, *Acharya Skandil* revived the *anuyoga*, which
led to this *vachana* being called the *Mathuri Vachana*, and the entire
*anuyoga* being considered related to *Skandil*.  The fourth *vachana* took
place in Vallabhi (Saurashtra) under the leadership of *Acharya Nagarjuna*
during the same time that the monks who were wandering in the north, east, and
central India were gathering in Mathura. However, the monks who gathered there
had forgotten a lot of the *shruta*. They compiled whatever they could remember.
This *vachana* is known as the *Vallabhi Vachana* or the *Nagarjuniya Vachana*.
The fifth *vachana* took place in Vallabhi again in the 10th century CE (980 or
993 CE, 454-466 CE) under the leadership of *Devaddigni Shramashraman*.

Believing that the *Jinavachana* was almost extinct due to the famine,
*Bhagavan* - *Nagarjuna*, *Skandilācārya*, and others - preserved it in books.

---------------------------
They were knowledgeable in the **Adik Sutra**. Due to various reasons like
weakness of memory, lack of reflection, decline in patience, and disruption of
tradition, a large part of the **Shruta literature** was lost. An attempt was
made to collect and preserve the forgotten **Shruta**. **Devadhigani**, with his
sharp intellect, compiled and put it in writing. An attempt was made to
harmonize the two readings, **Mathuri** and **Vallabhi**, and bring them into
uniformity. Where there was a lot of disagreement, the **Mathuri reading** was
given precedence, and the readings of the **Vallabhi reading** were placed in
the **variant readings**. This is why in the commentaries on the **Pragamas**,
we find instructions like "**Nagārjunīyāstu paṭhanti**" here and there. While
putting the **Agamas** in writing, **Devadhigani** kept some key points in mind.
Where there are similar passages in the **Pragamas**, instead of repeating them,
he has given directions for a specific text or place, such as "**Jaha Uvvaie,
Jaha Paṇṇavaṇāe**". If the same thing appears multiple times in a single
**Pragam**, the word "**Jāv**" has been used to indicate the last word, such as
"**Nāgakumārā Jāv Viharamti**" **Teṇa Kāleṇaṁ Jāv Parisā Niggayā**. In addition
to this, some of the main events after **Lord Mahavira** were also included in
the **Pragamas**. Since this reading took place in **Vallabhi**, it is called
the "**Vallabhi Reading**". After this, there was no universally accepted
reading of the **Bhagams**. After the tenth century of **Vīranirvāṇa**, the
tradition of **Pūrvajñāna** was disrupted. Due to this method, although a large
part of the **Pragam literature** was lost, some of the original parts of the
**Agamas** are still preserved today. The question may arise, why is the **Jain
Shragam literature** not fully available like the **Vedic literature**? Why did
it become disrupted? The main reason for this is that the **Agam literature**
was not written before **Devadhigani's** **Kshamasraman**. It continued in the
form of **Shruti**. Due to the lack of a capable and talented disciple, the guru
did not impart that knowledge to the disciple, due to which the **Shruta
literature** gradually became forgotten. Despite all this, the **Shruta
literature** available today is also very important. In it, the words of
**Prabhu Mahavira** are still available in many of its parts. This is not a
matter of little glory. The subject matter of **Jīvābhigam** - This **Pragam**
has nine **pratipattis** (chapters). The first **pratipatti** describes
**Jīvābhigam** and **Ajīvābhigam**. The word **abhigam** means **section** or
**knowledge**. **Ātmatattva** - In this infinite **lokaākāśa** or in the entire
universe, whatever is animate or inanimate, visible or invisible, or any
particular object or substance, is all included in these two terms - **Jīva** or
**Ajīva**. The fundamental elements are **Jīva** and **Ajīva**. The rest -
**pūṇya-pāpa, pāsa-saṁvara, nirjarā, bandha**, and **mokṣa** - are merely the
culmination of the combination and separation of these two elements. Other
**āstika** philosophies have also accepted these two fundamental elements in the
same way. **Vedanta** has considered them as **Brahma** and **Māyā**.
**Sāṅkhya** has considered them as **Purusha** and **Prakriti**, and
**Buddhists** have considered them as **vijñānaghana** and **vāsanā**. 1.

As the Vedic philosophy has recognized the same thing as the principle of the
soul and the principle of matter. In short, it can be said that the foundation
of the Astika philosophies is soulism. Jainism, in particular, has discussed the
principle of the soul in great detail with great subtlety. The stream of Jain
thought originates from the soul and ends in liberation. The beginning of the
Praacharaang Sutra is from the inquiry of the soul. In its first sentence, it is
said, "In this world, many beings do not know from which direction their soul
has come and where it will go? They also do not know whether their soul will
transmigrate in the next birth or not? Who was I in the previous birth and what
will I become after death in the next birth - they do not know this either."
From this inquiry of the soul, religion and philosophy have originated. The
beginning of the Vedanta philosophy is also from the Brahma Sutra's "Athaato
Brahma Jijnasa". Although the Vedas have a lot of provisions for yajnas and
praise of Indra and other gods for material prosperity, but in the later
Upanishads and Aranyakas, there has been a deep contemplation and description of
the principle of the soul. The voice of the sages of the Upanishads came out -
"The soul is to be seen, heard, contemplated and meditated upon." This stream of
thought, which began with the inquiry of the soul, gradually developed, flowed
in thousands of streams and finally merged into the ocean of immortality and
liberation. In the Upanishads, Maitreyi asks Yajnavalkya, "What should I do with
that which does not make me immortal? Tell me that which is the means of
immortality." According to Jain thinkers, the ultimate destination of every soul
is liberation. All practices and worship are for the attainment of liberation.
The goal of all soul seekers is to attain liberation, therefore, those seekers
are called "Mumukshu". From the beginning to the attainment of liberation, the
soul's fulfillment and meaning lies in the pursuit of excellence, and this is
the achievement. Therefore, in the nine principles accepted by Jain philosophy,
the first principle is the soul and the last principle is liberation. The
principles in between are related to the various processes of the non-soul
karmic elements that bind the soul due to its potential and transformation. The
group of pudgalas that gives happiness is the principle of punya. The principle
that gives sorrow and hinders knowledge etc. is sin. The soul's impure tendency
is asrava. To stop this impure tendency is samvara. The partial depletion of the
karmic covering is nirjara. The binding of karmic pudgalas with the soul is the
principle of bandha. The complete depletion of the karmic coverings is
liberation. As long as the soul remains in the potential state, it becomes bound
by the non-soul pudgalic karmic groups. As a result, it has to be bound in the
bondage of the body. It has to go from one body to another. In this way, the
tradition of taking and leaving the body continues. This tradition is birth and
death. The soul in the potential state keeps wandering in this cycle of birth
and death. This is the world. All the religious and spiritual efforts of the
souls in the potential state are to break this tradition of birth and death. The
soul is proved by self-awareness, direct perception and inference etc. Every
living being has the self-awareness of "I am". No one doubts their own
existence. "I am happy" or "I am sad" - this is self-awareness. 1. "In this
world, many beings do not know from which direction their soul has come and
where it will go? They also do not know whether their soul will transmigrate in
the next birth or not? Who was I in the previous birth and what will I become
after death in the next birth - they do not know this either." - Praacharaang
1-1 2. "The soul is to be seen, heard, contemplated and meditated upon." -
Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2-4-5 // 3. "What should I do with that which does not
make me immortal? Tell me that which is the means of immortality." -

"I am unhappy" - the "I" in this perception is the proof of the soul's direct
experience. This "Aham Pratyay" is the indicator of the soul's existence. The
soul is directly experienced because its knowledge quality is self-evident. Just
as things like pots and pans are considered directly experienced because their
qualities like form and color are directly experienced, similarly, the soul is
directly experienced because its knowledge quality is directly experienced. The
soul exists because its extraordinary quality of consciousness is observed.
Whatever has an extraordinary quality that is observed, its existence is
certain, like the eye. The eye, being subtle, is not directly visible, but its
existence is inferred from its power to produce the knowledge of form, which is
not produced by other senses. Similarly, the soul is inferred from its
consciousness quality, which is not found in inanimate objects. The Bhagavati
Sutra states: "Gautama! If there were no soul, who would rise? Who would perform
actions, strength, vigor, and effort? These actions, strength, vigor, and effort
are the manifestation of the soul's existence. Who acts with knowledge? Acting
and refraining with knowledge are also manifestations of the soul's existence."
The passage in the Bhagavati Sutra that describes the actions of pudgala is also
very thought-provoking. It states: "Gautama! If there were no pudgala, from what
would the body be formed? Who would be the cause of the divisions? From what
would the changing body be formed? Who would perform the functions of heat,
digestion, and illumination? Who would be the means of experiencing pleasure and
pain and delusion? How would sound, form, smell, taste, touch, and their
respective organs - ears, eyes, nose, tongue, and skin - be formed? Who would be
the cause of mind, speech, and pulsation? Whose are the inhalation and
exhalation? If there were no darkness and light, no food and movement, no sun
and shade, who would be small, who would be big? Who would be long, who would be
wide? If there were no triangles and quadrilaterals, no circles and spheres, no
conjunction and disjunction, no pleasure and pain, no life and death, this world
would be invisible." From the above quote from the Bhagavati Sutra, it becomes
clear that the worldly soul, afflicted by the karmic pudgalas, is associated
with them like milk and water. There is a close relationship between the soul
and the body. It is through this association that various activities occur.
Food, breathing, senses, language, and mind are neither the qualities of the
soul nor of the pudgala. They are the result of association - arising from the
association of the soul and the body. Hunger is not felt by the soul nor by the
body without the soul. The desire for enjoyment and consumption is not in the
soul nor in the body without the soul. The union of the soul and the body is
worldly life. As a result of the various consequences of actions, the worldly
soul attains various forms. Sometimes it is born in a stationary form, sometimes
in a mobile form. Sometimes it becomes one-sensed, sometimes two-sensed, three-
sensed, four-sensed, and sometimes five-sensed. Sometimes it is born as a woman,
sometimes as a man, and sometimes as a eunuch. Sometimes it is born as an animal
or bird, sometimes as a human, and sometimes it is born in the heavenly realm.
It is born and dies in eighty-four lakh species and families, and it suffers
from various circumstances. Jain scholars have described these various states of
the soul in a very subtle and detailed manner. 1. Bhagavati Shatak 13 U. 4, Su.

---------------------------
The concept of Jivaabhigam has been explored from various dimensions. By
classifying it in various ways from different perspectives, the scholars have
provided abundant information about the essence of the soul. The same is
compiled in the nine propositions of Jivaabhigam.   The first proposition states
that the venerable Bhagavants have revealed the knowledge of Jivaabhigam and
Ajivaabhigam according to the teachings of the omniscient and all-seeing
Tirthankara. Before explaining the Palpavaktavya, it is mentioned that
Ajivaabhigam is of two types - Rupee Ajivaabhigam and Praroopee Ajivaabhigam.
Ten types of Aroopee Ajivaabhigam are mentioned - the Skandha, Desh, and Pradesh
of Dharmaastikaya, the Skandha, Desh, and Pradesh of Adharmaastikaya, the
Skandha, Desh, and Pradesh of Aakaashaastikaya, and Pradhaasamya (time).
According to Jain principles, Dharmaastikaya etc. are the elements that help in
motion, and Adharma is the element that helps in stillness.   Aakash and Kaal
have been accepted by other philosophers as well, but Dharmaastikaya and
Adharmaastikaya have not been accepted by anyone except Jain philosophy. This is
a completely original concept of Jain philosophy.   Behind this original concept
is a strong foundation of evidence and logic. Jain Acharyas have proved through
logic that there must be a regulatory element for the arrangement of Lok and
Alok.   Jiva and Pudgal, which are dynamic, move only in Lok, not in Alok. There
must be some regulatory element for this. Otherwise, if Jiva and Pudgal were to
move in the infinite Alokakash, the situation of instability would arise, and
the entire Lokavyavastha would be shattered. Therefore, Jain thinkers have
accepted the existence of Dharma as the element that regulates motion and
Adharma as the element that regulates stillness.   Modern science has also
accepted the element that helps in motion (Medium of Motion). Newton and
Einstein have established the element of motion. Ether, accepted by scientists,
is another name for the element of motion.   Lok is finite. Alok beyond Lok is
infinite. The reason for Lok being finite is that Dravya or Shakti cannot go
beyond Lok. Beyond Lok, there is the influence of that Shakti which helps in
motion.   Lord Mahavira has said that all the vibrations happen with the help of
Dharma. If Dharma Tattva did not exist, who would go? Who would come? How would
sound waves spread? How would eyes open? Who would contemplate? Who would speak?
Who would move? This world would be immobile.   Dharma, the element that helps
in motion, is the cause of all that moves. Similarly, if Adharma, the element
that helps in stillness, did not exist, who would be able to stop while moving?
Who would sit? How would one sleep? Who would become motionless? How would a
blink happen? This world would always be moving. Adharma-Adharmaastikaya, the
element that helps in stillness, is the support for all that is static in
motion.   In this way, Jain thinkers have presented a completely original
concept in the form of Dharma and Adharma. All philosophers have accepted the
existence of Aakash. If Aakash did not exist, where would Jiva and Pudgal
reside? Where would Dharmaastikaya and Adharmaastikaya be present? Where would
Kaal be layered? Where would the stage of Pudgal be created? This world would be
baseless.   Kaal is a formal Dravya. From the perspective of Nishchayanaya, Kaal
is a synonym for Jiva and Ajiva. But from the perspective of Vyavahar Nay, it is
Dravya. Because its benefits are like Vartana etc. What is beneficial is Dravya.

---------------------------
The behavior that is exhibited for the limits of the states of substances, etc.,
is not different from them because it is a synonym of the soul, time, and form,
etc. There are four types of non-living beings: skandha, desha, pradesha, and
paramanu pudgala. This pudgala dravya is concrete. It is not a solid substance.
Its smallest form is a paramanu, and its largest form is the machitta, where
combination-separation, small-large, light-heavy, color, smell, taste, touch,
and structure are found. Jain theory considers light, darkness, shadow, falling
leaves, and sound to be pudgalic. Considering sound to be pudgalic is indicative
of the subtle vision of Jain philosophy. The Nyaya-Vaisheshika philosophy
considers sound to be a quality of light. Today's science has clarified the
pudgalic nature of sound. In an era when modern scientific instruments were not
available, Jain thinkers called sound pudgalic and also said that our sound
becomes ubiquitous in a moment. Even without a connection to a wire, the sound
of a loud bell resonates in countless yojanas away from other bells - this is a
discussion from a time when radio, wireless, etc. were not researched. After
describing the non-living beings in this way, the statement of living beings is
presented. Two distinctions have been made in the pure and impure nature of the
soul: the world-ending soul and the non-world-ending soul. Those souls who have
attained their pure form by performing the excellent worship of their knowledge,
vision, and character are non-world-ending souls. They do not return to the
world. Jain theory believes that just as a seed cannot sprout after being
burned, similarly, after the burning of the karma-like seed, the whirlpool-like
sprout cannot blossom. Jain philosophy does not believe in avatarism like
Buddhist or Vedic philosophy. It is an evolutionary philosophy. The world-bound
soul develops and becomes a perfected soul, and then it does not return to the
world. The world-ending souls are those who, being afflicted by the state of
being devoid of liberation, carry the complexities of karma-bondage and attain
various worldly bodies, senses, yogas, uses, leshyas, vedas, etc. This is the
impure state of the soul. The perfected state is the pure state of the soul, and
the world-bound embodied state is the impure state of the soul. The soul is pure
in its original form, but it cannot be said when it became impure. Just as the
lineage of the egg and the hen is eternal, it cannot be said whether the egg
came first or the hen? Similarly, it cannot be said when the world-bound soul
became impure. The relationship between the soul and karma has been going on
since time immemorial, therefore, the soul has been in an impure state since
time immemorial. Its goal is to attain purity from this impure state, and all
practices and worship are for that purpose. The Sankhya philosophy believes that
the soul is pure. It does not become impure. It is neither bound nor liberated.
Binding and liberation are of nature, the soul is eternal, inactive, and
attributeless. Just as a dancer retires after showing her dance on stage,
similarly, nature retires after completing its work - this separation of the
soul and nature is liberation. This belief of Sankhya philosophy is one-sided
and incomplete. If the soul is pure and eternal, then what is the purpose of
practice and worship? The need for practice arises only when the soul is impure.

---------------------------
From the Jain perspective, a liberated soul is a pure soul, while a soul bound
to a body is impure. The combination of soul and karma particles in a body-bound
soul is the reason for the soul's impure states. Due to these impure states,
Jain doctrine considers the soul to be ever-changing. It is neither eternally
permanent nor eternally impermanent, but rather eternally permanent in its
essence while impermanent in its states. The Buddhist philosophy, which
considers the soul to be eternally impermanent, is a one-sided and incomplete
view. If the soul is considered to be eternally fleeting, then bondage,
liberation, and other such events cannot occur. In such a situation, their
accepted theories of karma and rebirth would also not occur. Buddhist philosophy
is actually unclear about the soul. On the one hand, it is nihilistic, while on
the other hand, it accepts rebirth and karma. Jain philosophy is very clear
about the soul. It considers the soul to be eternally permanent and impermanent
from the perspective of the doctrine of non-absolutism. It accepts that the soul
experiences bondage and liberation. Even though it considers the soul to be
formless, it also considers the worldly soul to be somewhat form-bound. The
worldly soul possesses a body, perceives objects through the senses, and is
characterized by food, breathing, speech, and mind. Due to these
transformations, the soul is considered to be somewhat form-bound. All the
activities of worldly beings are due to the combination of soul and body, and
therefore they are composite. These actions cannot occur in the soul alone, nor
are they possible in the body alone.   The nine-fold view describes the
distinctions of the world-ending beings through nine types of beliefs. According
to the first belief, there are two types of worldly beings: non-stationary and
stationary. According to the second belief, there are three types: female, male,
and neuter. According to the third belief, there are four types of worldly
beings: hell-being, animal, human, and god. According to the fourth belief,
there are five types: one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, and
five-sensed. According to the fifth belief, there are six types of worldly
beings: earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied, air-bodied, plant-bodied, and
sky-bodied. According to the sixth belief, there are seven types of worldly
beings: hell-being, animal, female animal, human, luminous being, god, and
goddess. According to the seventh belief, there are eight types of worldly
beings: first-time hell-being, non-first-time hell-being, first-time animal,
non-first-time animal, first-time human, non-first-time human, first-time god,
and non-first-time god. According to the eighth belief, there are nine types of
worldly beings: earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied, air-bodied, plant-
bodied, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed. According to the
ninth belief, there are ten types of worldly beings: five types from first-time
one-sensed to first-time five-sensed, and five types from non-first-time one-
sensed to non-first-time five-sensed, making a total of ten types of worldly
beings.   All the aforementioned beliefs appear to be distinct, but there is no
contradiction in them from a philosophical perspective. The same object appears
different from different perspectives, but there is no contradiction. There are
different classifications and representations, but all the aforementioned
beliefs are non-contradictory. This is the characteristic of the doctrine of
non-absolutism. [23]

---------------------------
According to the first principle of Asatva and Sthavarattva, there are two
categories of worldly beings - Sa and Sthavar. Sthavar is further divided into
three categories - Prithvikaayik, Apkaayik and Vanaspatikaayik. Sa is also
divided into three categories - Tejaskaayik, Vaayukaayik and Udar Tras. Jain
Tirthankaras, through their pure and immaculate Kevalgyan, have observed and
examined the beings of the world in detail. Therefore, they are 'Sayya
Jagajivjooniviyaanak', the knowers of all the species of beings in the world.
They have not only acknowledged the existence of beings that are visible and
mobile, but have also recognized and categorized the presence of beings in
earth, water, fire, air and plants. Such a description and understanding is not
found anywhere else except in Jain principles. Jain Tattva thinkers clearly
instruct that there are beings in earth and other elements, and a non-violent
practitioner should strive to protect these subtle beings just as they protect
terrestrial creatures. The worship of the goddess of non-violence is not
complete by protecting only humans or animals, but one should also aim to be
completely non-violent towards beings with consciousness in earth, water, fire,
air and plants. While explaining the existence of beings in Prithvikaayadi, the
scholars have stated that the emergence and bondage of six types of karmas -
Upayog, Yog, Adhyavasaya, Matishrutgyan, Achakstudarshan, Prashta - as well as
Leshya, Sanjna, Shwasochchwas and Kashay, which are qualities found in beings,
are also found in Prithvikaayadi. Therefore, like humans, Prithvikaayadi should
also be considered as sentient beings. Although the above-mentioned
characteristics are latent in Prithvikaayadi, their existence cannot be denied
due to their latent nature. To clarify this, an example is given: If a man
consumes a large amount of intoxicating liquor and becomes unconscious due to
it, his consciousness becomes latent, but he cannot be called unconscious just
because of that. Similarly, the power of consciousness is latent in
Prithvikaayadi, but it cannot be denied. Prithvikaayadi, being one-sensed
beings, do not have ears, eyes, nose, tongue, speech and mind, so the question
arises as to how they experience pain. This is answered in the Praacharaang
Sutra with an example: If a blind, deaf, lame and disabled person is pierced
with a weapon in their feet, ankles, calves, knees, thighs, waist, navel,
stomach, ribs, back, chest, arms, fingers, nails, neck, beard, lips, teeth,
tongue, palate, cheeks, ears, nose, eyes, eyebrows, forehead, head, etc., they
will feel pain, but they cannot express it. Similarly, one-sensed Prithvikaayadi
beings experience latent pain. Just as a person in an unconscious state feels
pain if someone hurts them, so should the pain of Prithvikaayadi beings be
understood. Great scholars have proven the consciousness in one-sensed beings
through various arguments. The consciousness of plants is even more evident. In
the Visheshaavashyak Bhashya and other texts, it is proven with strong and solid
evidence that they have clear consciousness. While comparing plants to the
female body, the Praacharaang Sutra states that plants are like the human body
in terms of birth, nature, growth, consciousness, wilting when cut, they need
nourishment, and they experience changes. Therefore, like the human body, plants
are also conscious. [24]

The science of प्राधनिक has also proven the consciousness of plants. It has been
demonstrated through scientific means that plants experience emotions like
anger, happiness, laughter, attachment, etc. For example, plants have been
observed to show laughter and anger when criticized. In the presented argument,
two categories of worldly beings have been made: त्रस and स्थावर. While
explaining the origin of त्रस, the commentary states that beings who, due to
heat and other factors, move from one place to another in search of shade, etc.,
are त्रस. According to this derivation, only those beings who have the उदय of
the अस नामकर्म are considered त्रस, not the others. However, here, beings with
the उदय of the स्थावर नामकर्म, namely तेजस्काय and वायुकाय, are also called अस.
Therefore, the derivation of अस should be done in this way: those who move
upwards, downwards, or sideways, with or without intention, are अस, such as
तेजस्काय, वायुकाय, and द्वीन्द्रिय, etc. Those who cannot leave their place even
when subjected to heat and other factors, and remain there, are स्थावर beings,
such as earth, water, and plants. Generally, earth, water, fire, air, and plants
are considered as the five स्थावर. This is the statement in प्राचारांग. But
here, considering motion, तेजस् and वायु are called अस. Because the upward
movement of fire and the sideways movement of air are well-known. Reconciling
both statements, it is said that अस beings are of two types: गतित्रस and
लब्धित्रस. तेजस् and वायु are only गतित्रस, not लब्धित्रस. Those who have the
उदय of the त्रस नामकर्म, which is a form of लब्धि, are लब्धित्रस, such as
द्वीन्द्रिय, etc., who are उदार अस. Since तेजस् and वायु do not have this लब्धि,
they are not लब्धित्रस and are categorized as स्थावर. They are categorized as
त्रस here only in terms of motion. Two categories of पृथ्वीकाय have been made:
सूक्ष्म पृथ्वीकाय and बादर पृथ्वीकाय. Two categories of सूक्ष्म पृथ्वीकाय have
been mentioned: पर्याप्तक and अपर्याप्तक. Subsequently, to provide detailed
information about सूक्ष्म पृथ्वीकायिक beings, they have been described through
23 द्वार. These 23 द्वार are: शरीर, प्रवगाहना, संहनन, संस्थान, कषाय, संज्ञा,
लेश्या, इन्द्रियां, समुद्धात, संजी-प्रसंज्ञी, वेद, पर्याप्ति-अपर्याप्ति, दृष्टि,
दर्शन, ज्ञान, योग, उपयोग, पाहार, उपपात, स्थिति, समुद्घात करके मरण, च्यवन, गति,
and प्रागति. It is asked as a question: "O Bhagavan! How many bodies do those

living beings are divided into three divisions based on the Veda. Those
divisions are - female, male and neuter. Three types of females are mentioned -
1. Animal-born females, human females and god females. Hell beings are only
those who have neuter Veda, therefore, they do not have female or male Veda.
Three types of animal-born females are mentioned - aquatic, terrestrial and
aerial. Then, their further differences are mentioned. Three types of human
females are mentioned - those born in the land of karma, those born in the land
of no karma and those born in the end islands. Twenty-eight types of end island

After describing the state of a woman, the duration of her "sunchiththana" is
explained. "Sunchiththana" refers to the period for which a woman can remain in
her female form continuously (without leaving her "stree-swa"). The duration of
"sunchiththana" is explained for a normal woman and then for each "uttarabhed"
(sub-category). This information should be understood from both the original
text and the translation.   Following the "sunchiththana" period, the "antar"
(interval) is described. "Antar" refers to the period after a woman leaves her
female form and before she becomes a woman again. The "antar" period is
explained for a normal woman and for each "uttarabhed" woman.  After the "antar"
comes the description of "alp-bahutva" (lesser-greater). "Alp-bahutva" means to
explain the relative abundance or scarcity of something. This "alp-bahutva" is
explained in relation to different categories: "tiryak-stri" (animal women),
"manushya-stri" (human women), and "deva-stri" (divine women). The least
numerous are human women, animal women are many times more numerous, and divine
women are countless times more numerous.  Following this, the "alp-bahutva" of
"stree-ved" (female karma) is explained. It is said that the minimum "stree-ved"
is one-and-a-half sevenths of half a "sagaropama" (ocean-like) minus an
"uncountable" number of "palya-upama" (atom-like) parts, and the maximum is
fifteen "koti-koti" (billions of billions) "sagaropama". Fifteen hundred years
is the "abada-kal" (uninterrupted period), and the "karma-nisheka" (experiencing
period) is the period without "abada-kal". The period after the binding of karma
until its manifestation is called "abada-kal". The period when the "karma-dalik"
(karma particle) enters the "udaya-avali" (manifestation stream) is called
"karma-nisheka".   Then, "stree-ved" is compared to "kumfuma-agni" (glowing
embers). Just as the embers of a fire burn slowly and last for a long time, the
experience of "stree-ved" is slow and long-lasting.  After the explanation of
"stree-ved", the description of "purusha-ved" (male karma) follows. The
different categories of men are described, and their state, "sunchiththana",
"antar", and "alp-bahutva" are explained. Then, the binding state, "abada-kal",
and "karma-nisheka" of "purusha-ved" are explained, and "purusha-ved" is
compared to the flames of a "dava-agni" (forest fire).  In the description of
"napunsak-ved" (eunuch karma), it is said that eunuchs are of three types:
"narayik-napunsak" (male-like eunuch), "tiryak-yonik-napunsak" (animal-born
eunuch), and "manushya-yonik-napunsak" (human-born eunuch). There are no divine
eunuchs. Then, their different categories are described. Following this, their
state, "sunchiththana", "antar", "alp-bahutva", binding state, "abada-kal", and
"karma-nisheka" are explained. "Napunsak-ved" is compared to a "mahanagar-daha"
(great city fire).  Then, the "alp-bahutva" of the "vedas" (karmas) is explained
in terms of their types. It is said that men are the least numerous, women are
many times more numerous than men, and eunuchs are countless times more numerous
than women. Animal-born women are three times more numerous than animal-born
men. Human women are twenty-seven times more numerous than human men, and divine
women are thirty-two times more numerous than divine men.   "1. Three times more
are the animal women than the animal men, it should be known.  2. Twenty-seven
times more are the human women than the human men.  3. Thirty-two times more are
the divine women than the divine men, as declared by the Jinas, due to the
attachment and aversion." - Sangrahani-gatha [27]

## The Third Rebirth: Description of Hell  If the beings of the world are
divided into four parts, their division is as follows: Narayika, Tiryanchika,
Manushya, and Deva.   Narayika beings reside in seven types of hells. These
hells are below the Madhyaloka (middle world). They are called Narakprithvi
(hell-earths). Their names are: Ghamma, Vansha, Sela, Anjana, Rishta, Magha, and
Maghavati.   These have seven gotras (lineages): Ratnaprabha, Sharkaraprabha,
Balukaprabha, Pankaprabha, Dhoomaprabha, Tamahprabha, and Tamtamahprabha.   The
thickness of the Ratnaprabha earth is one lakh eighty thousand yojanas,
Sharkaraprabha is one lakh thirty-two thousand yojanas, Balukaprabha is one lakh
twenty-eight thousand yojanas, Pankaprabha is one lakh twenty thousand yojanas,
Dhoomaprabha is one lakh eighteen thousand yojanas, Tamahprabha is one lakh
sixteen thousand yojanas, and Tamtamahprabha is one lakh eight thousand yojanas.
The Ratnaprabha earth has three divisions (kanda): Khar Kanda (also called Ratna
Kanda), Pank Kanda, and Prapabahul Kanda. Only the Ratnaprabha earth has these
kanda; the rest are uniform.   In the Ratnaprabha earth, excluding one thousand
yojanas above and below, there are seven crore seventy-two lakh mansions of the
Bhavanavasi Devas above and thirty lakh Narakavasa (hell-dwellings) below.   In
the second Narakprithvi, excluding one thousand yojanas above and below, there
are twenty-five lakh Narakavasa. Similarly, in the third earth, there are
fifteen lakh, in the fourth ten lakh, in the fifth three lakh, in the sixth one
lakh minus five, and in the seventh five Narakavasa.   Below the Ratnaprabha
earth, after an immeasurable distance of yojanas, lies the second earth,
Sharkaraprabha. Below this, at an immeasurable distance of thousands of yojanas,
lies the Balukaprabha earth. The bottom of this third earth is two raju lower
than the Madhyaloka.   Below the third earth, at an immeasurable distance of
thousands of yojanas, lies the fourth earth, Pankaprabha. The bottom of this
earth is three raju lower than the Madhyaloka. Below this, at an immeasurable
distance of thousands of yojanas, lies the fifth earth, Dhoomaprabha. Its bottom
is four raju lower.   Below the fifth earth, at an immeasurable distance of
thousands of yojanas, lies the sixth earth, Tamahprabha. Its bottom is five raju
lower than the Madhyaloka. Below the sixth earth, at an immeasurable distance of
thousands of yojanas, lies the seventh earth, Tamtamahprabha. Its bottom is six
raju lower than the Madhyaloka.   Below the seventh earth, there is an area one
raju thick and seven raju wide where only Ekendriya beings reside.   These
Ratnaprabha, etc., earths are based on Ghanodadhi, Dhanavat, and Tanuvat. Below
them is Avakashantar (polar).   In the seven hells and their Avakashantar, there
is a widespread presence of pudgal dravyas (matter).   The shape of all the
earths from Ratnaprabha to Tamtamahprabha is described as similar to a Jhallari
(a type of ornament).   After that, the distance of Lokant (end of the world) is
described in all four directions from the seven hells.   All beings in the seven
hells, Ratnaprabha, etc., have been born and have emerged over time, as the
world is eternal.   Ratnaprabha, etc., are both eternal and non-eternal. They
are eternal in terms of dravya (substance) and non-eternal in terms of paryaya
(modification).   The establishment, dimensions, circumference, color, smell,
and touch of the Narakavasa are described, highlighting their inauspiciousness.
Regarding the four gatis (paths), the motion, progress, the pudgal of their
breath, the pudgal of their food, the leshya (tendencies), knowledge, prajna
(wisdom), use, avadhijna (clairvoyance), evidence, samudghat (agitation), the
seven hells, the pain of hunger and thirst, the pain of cold and heat, etc., are
described.

The infernal heat is compared to the warmth of the human world, describing the
undesirable karmic transformations of the hellish beings. Subsequently, the
state, evolution, and devolution (origin) of the hellish beings are described.
Concluding the description of the hellish beings, it is stated that hellish
beings experience extremely undesirable and inauspicious karmic transformations.
Their pain, blemishes, names, lineages, retribution, fear, sorrow, hunger,
thirst, diseases, breathing, mental anguish, anger, pride, delusion, greed,
food, fear, sexual desire, and possessions are all inauspicious and undesirable.
Often, those with great possessions, like Vasudeva, Mandalik kings,
Chakravartis, Tandal, Mastya, aquatic beings, Kalasokarik, and Kotambik (due to
their great ambitions, great possessions, and karmic consequences) are destined
for hell. In hell, even a moment of blinking is not a pleasure for the hellish
beings. There is only suffering. There is extreme cold, extreme heat, extreme
thirst, extreme hunger, and extreme fear. Hellish beings constantly experience
torment.  The Tiryanchadhikar has described five types of one-sensed, two-
sensed, etc., up to five-sensed beings of the Tiryancha (animal) realm. The one-
sensed beings are said to be of five types: earth, water, fire, air, and
vegetation.  Similarly, the distinctions and sub-distinctions of two-sensed,
three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed beings are described. The five-sensed
beings are said to be of two types: aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial, further
divided into two sub-types: Sammuchhim and Garbhavyutkrantik.  The aerial, etc.,
five-sensed beings of the Nirya-yonic (non-human) realm are said to have three
types of birth: Andaja (egg-born), Potaja (born from moisture), and Sammuchhim
(born from a union).  Andaja and Potaja are both three-veiled beings. Sammuchhim
are eunuchs. The description of these beings is given through their blemishes,
vision, knowledge, understanding, yoga, use, progress, movement, state, and
other aspects.  Subsequently, the concept of caste and lineage is discussed. In
the second discourse, six types of beings who cycle through the realms are
described: from those with an earth body to those with a breath body.  Their
distinctions and sub-distinctions are made. Their state, accumulation, and
purification are described.  In passing, there are questions and answers related
to knowing the pure and impure blemishes of the Angara (fire) beings, and the
pure and impure blemishes of the gods and goddesses.  Humans are of two types:
Sammuchhim humans and Garbhavyutkrantik humans.  Sammuchhim humans are born in
fourteen impure places in the realm. Their existence is only for a moment.
Garbhaja (born from the womb) humans are of three types: Karmabhubhak,
Akarmabhubhak, and Antipak.  The Antarvipak humans are located in the four
directions of the Himalayas, three hundred yojanas (a unit of distance) within
the salt ocean.  Similarly, within the salt ocean, four hundred, five hundred,
six hundred, seven hundred, eight hundred, and nine hundred yojanas further,
there are four Antarvipas in each direction.  Thus, there are 744-28 Antarvipas
in the Chulla Himalayas.  The humans residing in these Antarvipas are called
Antipak.  These Antarvipas have 28 names: 1. Ekohka, 2. Abhashik, 3. Vaishanik,
4. Nangalik, 5. Hayakarna, 6. Gajakarna, 7. Gokarna, 8. Shashkulkarna, 9.
Pradarshamukha, 10. Mendamukha, 11. Ayomukha, 12. Gomukha, 13. Ashvamukha, 14.
Hastimukha, 15. Singhamukha, 16. Vyaghamukha, 17. Ashvakarna, 18. Singhakarna,

is Akarmabhoomi. There are 30 Akarmabhoomi - five Himavat, five Hairanyavatt,
five Harivas, five Ramyakavas, five Devakuru and five Uttar Kuru / Out of these,

This text describes ornaments, buildings, clothes, villages, cities, and other
things. It also mentions various names of festivals, celebrations, dances,
vehicles, and so on. It lists names of arts, war, diseases, etc. It also
includes a beautiful and literary description of gardens, wells, ponds, banana
groves, beauty parlors, and the limbs of men and women. It is rich in ancient
cultural material. This text is very important for studying the various aspects
of ancient Indian social life.  The commentary literature of *Jivaabhigam* is
currently available in this form. No commentary or annotation has been written
on *Jivaabhigam*. However, a *churni* is available as the first commentary on
it, but it is unpublished. Therefore, it cannot be said clearly whether that
*churni* belongs to Jinadas Ganimahattar or Sanghadas Ganimahattar. A *vritti*
by Acharya Malayagiri is available in Sanskrit on *Jivaabhigam*. This *vritti*
is in the form of an explanation of the verses of *Jivaabhigam*.  The presented
*vritti* is in the form of an explanation of the verses of *Jivaabhigam*. This
*vritti* mentions the names of many texts and authors, such as
*Dharmasangrahani-toka*, *Prajnapanati-ka*, *Prajnapana-mul-tika*, *Tattvarth-
mul-tika*, *Siddhpraabhrut*, *Visheshnavati*, *Jivaabhigam-mul-tika*,
*Panchasangrah*, *Karma-prakriti-sangrahani*, *Kshetra-samas-tika*, *Jambu-dvip-
prajnapti-toka*, *Karma-prakriti-sangrahani-churni*, *Vasudeva-charit*,
*Jivaabhigamani*, *Chandra-prajnapti-tika*, *Surya-prajnapti-tika*, *Deshi-nama-
mala*, *Surya-prajnapti-niyukti*, *Pancha-vastuk*, *Tattvarth-tika* by Acharya
Haribhadra, *Tattvarth-bhashya*, *Visheshavashak-bhashya-svopagna-vritti*,
*Panchasangrah-tika*.  Many verses from these texts have been used in the
*tika*. At the beginning of the *vritti*, while shedding light on the purpose of
auspiciousness, the relationship between *tantu*, *por*, and *pat* has been
discussed in the verses of *Bhage*, and the nature of human settlements like
*mandalik*, *mahamandalik*, *gram*, *nigam*, *khet*, *karbat*, *madamb*,
*pattan*, *dronamukha*, *prakar*, *praadham*, *sambadh*, *rajadhani*, etc. has
been contemplated. While contemplating the differences between the knowers in
the *vritti*, it has been stated that the *Siddhpraabhrut* mentions many
knowers. It has shed light on the hellish abodes in great detail and has
indicated the observations of *Kshetra-samas-tika* and *Jambu-dvip-prajnapti-
tika*. While contemplating the cold and hot pains of hellish beings, it has
described the six seasons: *pravat*, *varsha-ratri*, *sharad*, *hemant*,
*vasant*, and *grishma*. The first *sharad* has been stated to be the month of
*kartik*. While contemplating the chariots of the celestial gods, it has
directed the curious to see *Chandra-prajnapti*, *Surya-prajnapti*, and
*Sangrahani-tika*. It also describes the eleven ornaments and gives a beautiful
description of the 32 types of dramatic methods mentioned in *Rajaprashni*.  The
Acharya has used the word 'vivaran' for this *vritti*, and the size of this
*vivaran* is 1600 verses. [35]

The translation of *Jivaabhigam* with *Pragam-Batteesi* was done by Acharya Shri
Pramolka Rishiji Maharaj. This translation is in the form of *bhavanuvad*.
Later, Acharya Shri Ghasilalji Maharaj of the *Sthanakwasi* tradition wrote a
detailed commentary on *Jivaabhigam* in Sanskrit. This commentary was also
published in Hindi and Gujarati. In addition, *Jivaabhigam* was published in
1883 from Ahmedabad by Rai Bahadur Dhanpatsingh with *Malayagiri Vritti* and
Gujarati commentary. In 1919, *Jivaabhigam* was published with *Malayagiri
Vritti* by Devchand Lalbhai Pustakoddhark Fund, Bombay. However, there was a
long-felt need for a Hindi publication that would be simple, easy to understand,
and clearly explain the subject matter. Late Yuvacharya Shri Madhukar Muniji
formed the Jan Pragam Prakashan Samiti. This committee published translations
and commentaries of many *Pragams* by eminent scholars. In the same vein, this
publication of *Jivaabhigam* is being released. It is a matter of great joy that
the work of *Pragam-Batteesi* is almost complete in a very short time with the
cooperation of many scholars. This *Pragam* is being edited by my disciple Shri
Rajendra Muni. Rajendra Muni is a young monk. Earlier, he had done a beautiful
editing of *Uttaraadhyaayan Sutra* and now he has shown his interest in
*Pragams* by editing this unique *Pragam* of *Dravyanuyog*. The translation and
commentary are capable of making the essence of the original *Pragam* clear.
This edition will appeal to the minds of the people and they will enhance their
knowledge by studying this *Pragam*. This is the hope. I wanted to write a
detailed preface to this *Pragam* like the prefaces of previous *Pragams*, but I
could not do so due to social work and a busy environment. The brief preface
that is being given will help the readers to understand the importance of the
*Pragam*. I have received immense grace from the most revered and glorious
National Saint Acharya Samrat Shri Pranand Rishiji Maharaj and I have the
blessings of the most revered and worshipful Gurudev Shri Pushkar Muniji
Maharaj. It is due to the grace of these great men that I have been able to make
some progress. May their grace always be with us, may we continue to achieve our
spiritual excellence under their pure shade, this is the auspicious wish.

"The primary introductory world-benefactor, the universally revered Lord of
Lords, the Tirthankara, the Supreme Being, has formulated this discourse to
guide all living beings across the ocean of existence, to liberate them from
worldly afflictions, diseases, and attachments, and to enable them to drink the
nectar of liberation, the indescribable bliss, by freeing them from the bonds of
karma that have existed since time immemorial. This discourse, being the means
to ferry beings across the ocean of existence, is called a 'Tirtha'. The
discourse is a Tirtha, and the Tirtha is a discourse. Because of creating this
Tirtha in the form of a discourse, the Lord Arihant is called a Tirthankara. The
discourse is in the form of the twelve-fold Ganipitaka. Although the discourse
is timeless and infinite in its flow, it is considered the beginning for the
specific Tirthankara. Therefore, by saying 'Namaste Tirthaya', even the
Tirthankara, the Supreme Being, bows to the timeless and infinite Tirtha.
Because of its use in the twelve-fold Ganipitaka, the four-fold order of monks
is also called a Tirtha or discourse. This discourse formulated by the
Tirthankara is in the form of the twelve-fold. The Lord Toयंकर, the Supreme
Being, explains its meaning, and the wise Ganadharas compile it in the form of a
sutra. This twelve-fold, taught by the omniscient, all-seeing Tirthankara, the
Supreme Being, and compiled by the Ganadharas, the holders of fourteen previous
births, is the form of the limbs of the Shruta-purusha. That which is not
contradictory to this twelve-fold and is composed by the Shruta-sthaviras is the
form of the limbs of the Shruta-purusha. From this perspective, Shruta
literature is of two types: Anga-praveshta and Ananga-praveshta. That which is
composed by the Ganadharas, which is in the form of an answer to a question, and
which is fixed in the Tirtha of all Tirthankaras is called Anga-praveshta
Shruta. The twelve Angas, from Pracharanga to Dastivada, are Anga-praveshta
Shruta. That which is composed by the Shruta-sthaviras, which is in the form of
free grammar without being asked a question, and which is not fixed in the
Tirtha of all Tirthankaras is called Ananga-praveshta Shruta. For example, the
twelve Upangas like Propapattika, etc., and the Mula, Chhedasutra, etc. 1. The
Lord's teachings are said to be for the protection of all living beings, etc. 2.
The discourse, which is comprehensive, encompassing the essence of the soul,
etc., is the primary, excellent, and initial word, the twelve-fold Ganipitaka. -

also called a discourse, because of its use in the Ganipitaka, etc. -

## The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigma Sutra  This Jiva-Jiva-Abhigma Sutra is the third Upanga
of the Sthananga, the third Anga. It is composed by the Shruta-Sthaviras. There
are two types of Anga-Bahya-Shruta: Kalika and Utkalika. Those Shruta that can
be read throughout the day and night, avoiding non-study, are Utkalika, such as
the Dasha-Vakalika, etc. Those that are read only in the first and last parts of
the day and night are Kalika-Shruta, such as the Uttara-Adhyayana, etc. This
Jiva-Jiva-Abhigma Sutra is an Utkalika Sutra.  "The study of Jiva-Jiva-Abhigma
is a practice, and like the crushing of thorns and branches, a pointless
practice is not for the wise. Therefore, at the beginning of the text, the
purpose, the subject matter, and the connection should be explained with
auspiciousness."  **1. Purpose**  Purpose is of two types: (1) Anantara-
Prayojana and (2) Parampara-Prayojana.  Again, purpose is of two types: (1)
Kartr-gata-Prayojana and (2) Shrotr-gata-Prayojana.  **Kartr-gata-Prayojana:**
This Jiva-Jiva-Abhigma study is devoid of a doer in relation to Dravya-Athika-
naya, because it is eternal, constant. The Agama says, "This Dvadasha-Anga
Ganipitaka was not in the past, it is not in the present, and it will not be in
the future. It is firm, constant, eternal." There is no doer of an eternal
thing. In relation to Paryaya-Athika-naya, its doers are the Arhants in relation
to meaning, and the Ganadharas in relation to the Sutra. The meaning-form Agama
is eternal, but the Sutra-form Agama is impermanent. Therefore, the Sutra-kar's
Anantara-Prayojana is to grace the beings, and the Parampara-Prayojana is to
attain liberation.  Here, it can be doubted: What is the purpose of the meaning-
expounding of the Arhant Bhagavan, the creator of the meaning-form Agama? They
have already achieved their goal; how can purposefulness arise in them? The
solution is that although the Tirthankara Paramatama have already achieved their
goal, therefore purposefulness does not arise in them, yet they are engaged in
meaning-expounding due to the arising of the Tirthankara-Nama-Karma. As it is
said, "How is the Tirthankara-Nama-Karma experienced? By giving Dharma-Deshana
with a non-lazy attitude, the Tirthankara-Nama-Karma is experienced."  **1.

[Primary Introduction] The immediate purpose of the listener is to understand
the meaning of the intended study, and the ultimate purpose is to attain the
state of liberation (Nishreyas). After understanding the intended meaning, the
listener will be inclined towards restraint (Samyama), and through restraint, he
can destroy all karmas and attain liberation. Thus, the attempt to begin this
presented study is purposeful, not purposeless. / 2. Objective - The objective
(subject) of the presented scripture is to expound the nature of the living
(Jiva) and the non-living (Ajiva), as is evident from its name itself. The study
of the living and the non-living, i.e., the knowledge of their characteristics,
is called Jivajivaabhigam study. The sutrakar (author of the sutras) has adorned
the presented sutra with a meaningful name. 3. Relationship - There are two
types of relationships in the presented scripture: (1) Upayopeyabhava
relationship and (2) Guruparvakramrupa relationship. / From the perspective of
those who follow logic, there is an Upayopeyabhava relationship. / The chapters
in the form of Nay (principles) and Vachan (statements) are the means (Upaya),
and their knowledge is the end (Upeya). _ The Guruparvakramrupa relationship is
only from the perspective of those who follow faith. From the perspective of
meaning, this Jivajivaabhigam has been spoken by the Tirthankara (liberated
soul), and from the perspective of the sutras, it has been spoken by the
Ganadharas (disciples) in the Dvadasanga (twelve parts of Jain scriptures). /
After this, for the benefit of those with dull intellect, the fourteen
Purvadharas (predecessors) with extraordinary knowledge have stated and
organized this Jivajivaabhigam as a separate study from the third Anga (part)
called Stananga. / Therefore, it is said in the form of the third Upanga (sub-
part). Considering such relationships, the sutrakar has said "Therā Bhagavanto
Paṇṇavainsu". 4. Auspiciousness - The presented study is inherently auspicious
because it is the cause of right knowledge (Samyagjnana) and, according to
tradition, leads to liberation. However, according to "Shreyānsi Bahuvighnāni"
(auspicious things are often obstructed), there is a tradition of performing
auspicious rituals in the scriptures to pacify obstacles and to instill
auspiciousness in the mind of the student. In adherence to this custom,
auspicious invocations (Mangalacharan) are performed at the beginning, middle,
and end of the text. The purpose of the initial auspicious invocation is to
ensure the smooth completion of the text and to overcome obstacles encountered
in the study of the scriptures. / The middle auspicious invocation is for its
stability, and the final auspicious invocation is performed so that the text
does not break from the student-teacher tradition. / In the presented study, the
auspicious invocation is "Iha Khalu Jinamya" etc. The inscription of the name of
Jin (Tirthankara) is auspicious. 1. Jīvānāmājīvānāmābhigamo Paričchedo Yasmin

6. The description of the nature of the **Jiva-Jiva-Migam Sutra** islands,
oceans, etc. is **Madhyamangal**. Because in **Nimitta Shastra**, islands, etc.
are considered to be of the highest auspiciousness. As it is said, "Whoever asks
for the purpose of **Jiva-Jiva-Migam Sutra**, they will attain their desired
wealth." "**Dasaviha Savve Jiva**" - this is the ultimate auspiciousness.
Because it is the cause of the knowledge of all beings, it is auspicious. Or,
the entire scripture itself is auspicious. Because it is the cause of
**Nirjara**. Just as **Tap** is auspicious because it is the cause of
**Nirjara**, scripture is auspicious because it is the form of **Samyag Jnana**
and is the cause of **Nirjara**. Because it is said, "The ignorant one expiates
the karmas that they have accumulated over many millions of years, while the
**Gupt Jnani** expiates them in the time of a single breath, through mind,
speech, and body." Thus, after describing the purpose, etc., and the
auspiciousness, the study begins. 1. "The ignorant one expiates the karmas that
they have accumulated over many millions of years, while the **Gupt Jnani**
expiates them in the time of a single breath, through mind, speech, and body."

The First Chapter, Auspicious Introduction 1.  These venerable ones, the Theras,
having contemplated, accepted, and delighted in the Jain-filled, Jain-
originated, Jain-concordant, Jain-ordained, Jain-shaped, Jain-declared, Jain-
approved, Jain-taught, Jain-praised, and Jain-beneficial, have formulated the
study called "Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamanam" (The Interrelation of Souls). [1] In this
human world, or in Jain discourse, the twelve-limbed Ganipitaka, the doctrine of
the Tirthankara Supreme Being, which is approved by all other Tirthankaras, is
Jain-concordant, Jain-ordained, Jain-shaped, Jain-declared, Jain-approved, Jain-
taught, Jain-praised, and Jain-beneficial.  Having contemplated, accepted, and
delighted in it, these venerable ones, the Theras, have formulated the study
called "Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamanam" (The Interrelation of Souls).  Commentary: This
first sutra, while adhering to the customary practice of auspicious invocation,
introduces the treatise.  The highly intelligent, fourteen-fold-virtuous,
scripture-versed, venerable ones, having thoroughly contemplated and practiced
the twelve-limbed Ganipitaka, the doctrine of the Tirthankara Supreme Being,
have, with faith, acceptance, and delight in the ultimate truth, formulated the
study called "Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamanam" (The Interrelation of Souls).  The word
"Jinamya" in the sutra is the noun, and the words from "Jinanumaya" to
"Jinapastham" are its attributes.  Through these attributes, the sutra-author
has described the glory and grandeur of Jain doctrine.  These attributes all
represent different aspects of "Janamata" (Jain doctrine).  The meaning of each
attribute is as follows:  Jinanumaya: This Jain doctrine is approved by the
Jinas.  The present-day Jain doctrine is moving under the authority of the
supreme Tirthankara, the Jain-ruler, the present Tirtha-adhipati, Shri
Vardhamana Swami.  After conquering the internal enemies like attachment and
aversion, and attaining omniscience and perfect vision, Jineshwara Shri
Vardhamana (Mahavira) Swami formulated the twelve-limbes, from Pracharanga to
Drishtivada.  This is "Janamata".  This "Jinamata" of Prabhu Mahavira, being the
universal truth, is approved by all Tirthankaras, past, present, and future.
All the Tirthankaras who have been in the past, like Rishabha, and those who
will be in the future, like Padma-nabha, and those who are present, like
Simandhara Swami, all approve and accept it.  Eternal truth is always uniform.
There is no inconsistency or difference in it.  This statement conveys that due
to the absence of contradiction in the words of all Tirthankaras, there is
uniformity.  Jinanuloma: This Jain doctrine is Jain-concordant, i.e., favorable
to the Jinas.  Here, "Jina" refers to Avadhi-jina, Manah-paryaya-jina, and
Kevala-jina.  This Jain doctrine is favorable to Avadhi-jina, etc., because:  1.
Jina-approved, as stated by the Jinas, the Manah-paryaya-Jinas, and the Kevala-
Jinas.

The *Jivajivaabhigamsutra* is suitable. It means that by this principle,
*Jinatva* is attained. As said, by partaking of the *Jinamat*, the *Sadhu* class
attains *Avadhijnana*, *Man:paryavgyana* and *Kevalgyana*. Therefore, *Jinamat*
is adorned with the epithet *Jinanulom*. *Jinappaniyam* - This *Jain* principle
is *Jin* originated. That is, it is stated by the present *Tirthadhipati* Shri
Vardhaman Swami. Upon attaining *Kevalgyana*, Shri Vardhaman Swami told the
*Ganadharas* like Gautama, who had the supreme qualities like *Beejabuddhi*, the
three *Matrika* words, which are the essence of all meanings, " *Uppanna* *iva*,
*Vigame* *iva*, *Dhuvei* *iva*." Taking these three *Matrika* words as the
basis, the *Ganadharas* like Gautama composed the *Dwadashangi*. Therefore, this
*Jinamat* is *Jin* originated. This statement shows that the *Pragam* *sutra* is
*Paurusheya* and not *Apaurusheya*. *Agama* is a word form and without the
action of a person, words cannot be uttered. Without the action of a person,
words do not sound in the sky. Those who follow the *Mimamsa* school consider
*Agama* to be *Apaurusheya*. Their belief is refuted by this epithet.
*Jinparooviyam* - This *Jinamat* is formulated by the *Jineshwara*. This epithet
shows that Lord Vardhaman Swami formulated this principle in such a way that the
listeners could understand its essence well. Here, one may doubt that this study
or topic will remain with unknown meaning, even if it is heard from the
*Sarvagya*. Because the intention of the *Sarvagya* cannot be grasped directly.
In such a situation, how will there be conviction or belief in the meaning of
the word that is the subject of that intention? Just as a *Mlechchha* person can
only imitate the speech of an *Aarya* person, but cannot understand its meaning,
similarly, the listener cannot understand the meaning of the words of the
*Sarvagya*. The solution to the above doubt is that although the intention of
the speaker is indirect, it is still known through inference etc. By knowing the
intention, the listener gets to know the meaning of the word with the help of
the indication. If this does not happen, then the eternal word usage will be
destroyed. There will be no use of word usage. Even a child understands the
meaning from words. Words like *Saindhava* etc., which have many meanings, are
also indicated by the Lord and tell the fixed meaning through context and
appropriateness etc. Therefore, even words with multiple meanings convey the
intended meaning. ... The Lord formulates the principles in such a way that the
listener gets the right understanding. The Lord is well-wisher of all, He is not
misleading, therefore, He makes the one who understands otherwise understand his
mistake and makes him realize the true meaning. He does not ignore the one who
understands otherwise, because He is engaged in the propagation of the *Tirtha*.
Therefore, the *Ganadharas* get the intended meaning directly from the words of
the Lord and the rest of the listeners get it through tradition. Therefore,
*Agama* does not have an unknown meaning. 1. *Paryabhiprāyam ajñātvā mleccha

## First Understanding: Auspicious Introduction  **Jinaakhyam:** This Jain
doctrine is spoken directly by the Jinesvara through the power of words. Some
wise people say that the Tirthankara does not make any effort to preach, but due
to their excellent virtuous past deeds, the listeners have that impression. Just
as a Cintamani (wish-fulfilling gem) itself has no color, but due to the contact
of the object, it appears colored. Similarly, the Tirthankara does not make any
effort to preach, yet due to their virtuous influence, the listeners feel that
the Tirthankara is presenting such and such things. This statement is not
appropriate. To refute this opinion, the epithet 'Jinaakhyam' is given. This
means that the Tirthankara preaches through the direct act of speech, arising
from the Tirthankara karma. Even if the listeners feel that way due to mere
dominance, when the direct act of speech is available, it would be an
exaggeration. Such an assumption could be made elsewhere as well. In such a
situation, there would be a direct contradiction. Therefore, the aforementioned
belief is not consistent with logic and evidence.  **Jinaanuchinnm:** This Jain
doctrine is realized through Samadhi by the Ganadharas. Here, the word 'Jin'
should be understood as referring to the Ganadharas. The Ganadharas are endowed
with such power that nothing can stop them from attaining benefit. They
understand the meaning of this Jain doctrine deeply, and by non-attachment, they
attain equanimity and experience the state of Samadhi. Because it is practiced
by the Ganadharas, this Jain doctrine is called 'Jinaanuchinnm'. Alternatively,
in the past, the ordinary Kevali and other Jins have consumed this doctrine and
attained Jintva (liberation). From this perspective as well, 'Jinaanuchinnm'
should be understood as consistent.  **Jinpannattam:** This Jain doctrine is
declared by the Ganadharas. Due to the extraordinary excellence attained through
the aforementioned state of Samadhi, the Ganadharas develop a unique power,
through which they create the scriptures in the form of sutras, with
distinctions like the Angas, Upangas, and Praacharas. Therefore, this Jain
doctrine is in the form of sutras, created by the Ganadharas, meaning
'Jinprajnapta'. The Agamas say, "The Tirthankara speaks in the form of meaning,
and the Ganadharas weave it into the form of sutras." In this way, the sutras
are established for the benefit of the Jain religion.  **Jindeshiyam:** This
Jain doctrine is given by the Ganadharas only to those who are worthy and
inclined towards the path of righteousness. This implies that only worthy people
should be given knowledge of the principles of the sutras. Here, the word 'Jin'
is used for the Vineyas (disciples) who are inclined towards the path of
righteousness. This scripture should be given only to those listeners who are
facing the path of righteousness and are turned away from the path of
unrighteousness. Sudharma Ganadhara gave this scripture to such a worthy Vineya,
Shri Jambuswami.  1.  Then the impression arises in the beings due to that
dominance. But he himself is situated like a Cintamani, without any effort. 2.
First, the Ganadharas, who are wise, weave the sutras and the scriptures. For
the benefit of the religion, the sutras are established. 3.  Here, the Jins are
those who are inclined towards the path of righteousness, whose lineage is pure,
who are facing the right path, and who are turned away from the wrong path. -

[10] The **Jivajivaabhigamsutra** raises the question: If the **Shruta-
siddhant** is inherently beautiful, why isn't it given to everyone? The answer
is that there is a possibility of harm arising from the inherently unbeautiful
nature of unqualified individuals. It is often seen that the sun's rays, which
are inherently beautiful, are harmful to owls and other such creatures due to
their unsuitability. It is said that one should use something only if it is
beneficial for that particular being. For a fish, a hook with bait attached is
harmful even though it is food.   **Jinapassattham** - This **Jinamat** is
beneficial for qualified and deserving individuals. Here, the word "Jin" is used
for those who are inclined towards the path of righteousness and are averse to
the path of unrighteousness. Just as a healthy diet is beneficial for a healthy
person because it prevents future diseases, similarly, this **Jinamat** is
beneficial for those who are inclined towards the path of righteousness and are
averse to the path of unrighteousness. By consuming it properly, this
**Jinamat** proves to be beneficial and auspicious.   Through proper
contemplation of this unique **Jinamat** with their **protpatik** and other
intellects, the **sthavir bhagavants** who have faith, understanding, and
interest in it have formulated this study called **Jivajivaabhigam**, a
meaningful name. Although due to the **kaladosha**, intellect and other
qualities are declining, one should still understand that even a little
knowledge and practice of **Jinamat** is capable of destroying **bhava**. With
this belief, one should have faith in **Jinamat** with a gentle heart.
**Sthavir bhagavants** refer to those **acharyas** whose knowledge and character
have matured. Their minds are free from confusion due to **dharmparinnati**, and
they have destroyed their **kashayas** through the wealth of **Shruta**. Thus,
this sutra discusses the relationship between **guruparvkrama** and its
characteristics, as well as its **abhidheya** (purpose).  **Swrupa and Prakar**
(Nature and Types) 2. What is **Jivajivaabhigam**? **Jivajivaabhigam** is said
to be of two types: 1. **Jivaabhigam** and 2. **Ajivaabhigam**.   1.

## 12] [Jiva-Jivaabhigamsutra]  These sutras generally contain questions and
answers. The original text does not mention any specific questioner like
Gautama, nor does it address Gautama or anyone else in the answers. This implies
that most of the sutra literature was composed as questions asked by the
Ganadharas and answers given by Lord Vardhaman Swami. A small portion is
composed of questions asked by other inquisitive individuals and answered by the
Sthaviras.   The entire Shruta literature is not just questions asked by the
Ganadharas and answered by the Lord. This particular sutra is also a general
one, asked by other inquisitive individuals and answered by the Sthaviras. The
first question asks about the nature of Jiva-Jivaabhigam. The answer explains
its nature by describing its different aspects.   Jiva-Jivaabhigam is of two
types: Jivaabhigam and Ajivabhigam. Abhigam means understanding, comprehension,
or knowledge. Knowledge of the Jiva-dravya is Jivaabhigam, and knowledge of the
Ajiv-dravya is Ajivabhigam.   There are essentially two fundamental principles
in this universe: the Jiva principle and the Ajiv principle. Everything else is
an expansion of these two principles. To emphasize that these two fundamental
principles are of equal strength in terms of dravya, the letter 'ch' is used in
both terms.   Jiva and Ajiv are both distinct in nature and have independent
existence. The correct understanding of the difference between the Jiva and Ajiv
principles is the main subject of spiritual science. Therefore, the scriptures
discuss the nature of Jiva and Ajiv in detail.   The knowledge of the difference
between Jiva and Ajiv leads to Samyagdarshan, and then Samyagjnana and
Samyakcharitra lead to liberation. Therefore, Jivaabhigam and Ajivabhigam are
traditionally considered the cause of liberation.   The sutrakar first mentions
Jivaabhigam and then Ajivabhigam. According to the principle of
'Yathouddeshastatha nirdhesh:' one should give instructions according to the
purpose. Therefore, questions and answers regarding Jivaabhigam should have been
discussed first, but instead, questions and answers regarding Ajivabhigam were
discussed first.   The reason for this is that there is much to be said about
Jivaabhigam, while there is less to be said about Ajivabhigam. Therefore,
according to the principle of 'Soochikataah,' questions and answers regarding
Ajivabhigam are discussed first.   Ajivabhigam is of two types: 1. Roopi-
Ajivabhigam and 2. Aroopi-Ajivabhigam. Generally, anything that has form is
called Roopi. However, here, Roopi refers to form, taste, smell, touch, and all
four.   By implication, taste, etc., are also included along with form, as these
four cannot exist without each other. Every atom possesses form, taste, smell,
and touch. This refutes the idea that atoms of form are separate and atoms of
taste, etc., are entirely separate.   Considering atoms of form, taste, etc., as
entirely separate is contradicted by direct experience. We see that atoms of
form like ornaments also possess touch simultaneously, and atoms of taste like
ghee also possess form and smell. Atoms of smell like camphor also continuously
possess form. Therefore, form, taste, smell, and touch are inseparable.   Those
with form, taste, smell, and touch are Roopi Ajiv, and those without form,
taste, smell, and touch are Aroopi Ajiv.   1. **"Karanamaev tadantyam sookshmo

## First Understanding: Nature and Types  Formless non-living entities are not
known through sensory perception. They are known through the scriptures
(Agamas). There are ten types of formless non-living entities: 1. Dharma-
āstikāya, 2. The realm of Dharma-āstikāya, 3. The regions of Dharma-āstikāya, 4.
Adharma-āstikāya, 5. The realm of Adharma-āstikāya, 6. The regions of Adharma-
āstikāya, 7. Ākāśa-āstikāya, 8. The realm of Ākāśa-āstikāya, 9. The regions of
Ākāśa-āstikāya, and 10. Adhāsamaya. These distinctions are explained in the
Prajñāpanā Sūtra.  1. **Dharma-āstikāya:** Dharma-āstikāya is the instrumental
cause that helps in the movement of self-moving living beings and pudgalas. Just
as water helps fish to swim, a stick helps an old person to walk, and a lamp
helps a sighted person to see, similarly, Dharma-āstikāya helps in the movement
of living beings and pudgalas as an instrumental cause. It is important to note
that Dharma-āstikāya does not motivate living beings and pudgalas to move, but
only assists them. Just as water does not move the fish, a stick does not move
the old person, and a lamp does not show the sighted person, but only assists
them, similarly, Dharma-āstikāya assists in movement but does not motivate it.
The existence of Dharma-āstikāya has not been accepted by any other philosophers
besides Jainism. Therefore, a natural curiosity arises: what is the evidence for
the existence of Dharma-āstikāya? In response, Jain philosophers and scholars
have stated that it is necessary to accept Dharma-āstikāya as the regulatory
element that governs the movement of living beings and pudgalas. If such a
regulatory element is not accepted, then the orderly arrangement of this
universe cannot be established. The movement of inert and conscious substances
is an empirical fact. If they were to move freely in infinite space, then the
orderly arrangement of this world would not be possible. Infinite pudgalas and
infinite living beings would move freely in infinite space, becoming so
scattered that their meeting and appearance in the form of a fixed creation
would become impossible. Therefore, Dharma-āstikāya, the regulatory element that
governs the natural movement of living beings and pudgalas, has been accepted.
Only by accepting the existence of Dharma-āstikāya can the division of the world
(lok) and non-world (alok) be justified. Despite their natural tendency to move,
living beings and pudgalas cannot go outside the world (lok) into the non-world
(alok). An atom, from the smallest atom to the largest, can move up to fourteen
rajū-lengths. Beyond that, it cannot move in a single region. Who regulates
this? Ākāśa cannot be the regulator of this movement because Ākāśa is equally
present in the non-world (alok). Therefore, the regulator of this movement is
Dharma-āstikāya. Where Dharma-āstikāya is present, there is the movement of
living beings and pudgalas, and where Dharma-āstikāya is not present, there is
no movement of living beings and pudgalas.   1.  "The movement of pudgalas and
living beings is due to Dharma-āstikāya. It is the instrumental cause, just as
water is always present for fish in the world."

## Translation:  **14]** [Jiva-jiva-abhigamsutra motion does not exist. Dharma-
astikaya is only in the loka-akasha, therefore the motion of jivas and pudgalas
is limited to the loka-akasha / In this way, the existence of dharma-astikaya is
proven by its function as an aid to motion. The entire dharma-astikaya is an
undivided, indivisible substance, it is in the form of a skandha. Its countless
regions are in the form of components / The combined form of the components, the
specific result, is the component. Just as the combined form of threads, the
patanavitan form, is the cloth. There is nothing else than the cloth, different
from the threads. The component and the component are somehow different and not
different. 2. The division of dharma-astikaya into two regions, three regions,
etc., conceived by intellect, is called the desha of dharma-astikaya. In
reality, dharma-astikaya is an undivided substance. Its desha-pradesha, etc.,
divisions are only conceived by intellect. 3. The region of dharma-astikaya, the
very subtle part of the skandha, which cannot be further divided, is called
pradesha. 'Pradesha nivibhaga bhaga:' meaning the indivisible, non-fractional
part of the skandha, etc., is called pradesha / These pradeshas are countless,
meaning they are as vast as the loka-akasha / These pradeshas can only be
conceived by intellect / In reality, they cannot be separated from the skandha.
In this way, three divisions of dharma-astikaya have been explained: skandha,
desha, and pradesha / The question may arise: why is the dharma-dravya called
astikaya? The solution is that here 'asti' means pradesha and 'kaya' means
combination or community. The community of pradeshas is called astikaya. Dharma-
dravya is in the form of a collection of countless pradeshas, therefore it is
called astikaya. 4. Adharma-astikaya - the element that aids the state of jiva
and ajiva is adharma-astikaya. Just as the shade of a tree becomes a cause for a
traveler to rest, in the same way, adharma-astikaya aids the state of jivas and
pudgalas / It is also an aid to the state, not a motivator / All the states of
being are only possible when adharma-astikaya exists. Like dharma-astikaya, it
is also an undivided, indivisible unit / It is countless-pradeshi and pervades
all lokas / 5-6. The desha and pradesha of adharma-astikaya - there are three
divisions of adharma-astikaya: skandha, desha, and pradesha / The entire object
is called skandha. The division conceived by intellect, such as two regions,
etc., is called desha, and the smallest part that is combined with the object -
which cannot be further divided - is called pradesha. 1. There is no perception
of cloth, etc., apart from threads, etc. / Threads, etc., are not distinct, they
are designated as cloth, etc. / 2. Pradeshas are the astis, their kaya is the
combination. / 'Gana kae ya nikae khandhe vagge ya rasi ya' - according to this
statement, astikaya is the combination of pradeshas. - Malayagiri Vritti 3.

## First Understanding: Nature and Types [15 7-8-6]  **Akasa (Space)** is a
universally accepted formless substance. According to its literal meaning, Akasa
is that in which all other substances are illuminated and manifested without
losing their own nature, or that which pervades all substances and is
illuminated. Providing space (avagaha) is the characteristic of Akasa. Just as
milk provides space for sugar, and a wall provides space for a peg, Akasa is the
foundation of all substances. All other substances are dependent on it.
Although all substances are self-established (svapratiṣṭhita) in their own
nature from the perspective of **niścayana (absolute truth)**, from the
perspective of **vyavaharanaya (practical truth)**, Akasa is the foundation of
all substances.   One might ask, if Akasa is the foundation of all substances,
what is the foundation of Akasa? The answer is that Akasa is self-established.
It is not dependent on any other substance. There is no substance greater than
or similar to Akasa. Akasa is infinite. It is all-pervasive, encompassing both
the world (loka) and the non-world (aloka).  **From a gross perspective, there
are two types of Akasa:**  * **Loka Akasa:** The portion of Akasa where the five
categories of substance (pancastīkāya) - dharma, adharma, akasa, pudgala, and
jīva - exist. Loka Akasa has countless regions. * **A-loka Akasa:** Where only
Akasa exists and nothing else. It is infinite in its regions, boundless and
endless. Loka Akasa is merely a point in the vast ocean of A-loka Akasa.  The
entire Akasa is the **skandha (mass)** of the Akasa category. Its intellectually
conceived portion is the **deśa (region)** of the Akasa category. The
indivisible, non-fractional parts of the Akasa substance are the **pradeśa (sub-
regions)** of the Akasa category.  **Time (Kāla)**  **Adha-samaya-pradha** means
time. It is called adha-samaya because it is in the form of time. Alternatively,
the smallest indivisible part of time is adha-samaya. Only the present moment is
truly real (sat). The past has perished, and the future has not yet come into
existence. Therefore, the past and future are unreal (asat), only the present
moment is real.   Since time is a single entity, it does not form a group, and
therefore, the concept of deśa and pradeśa does not apply to it. Time is the
divider of the time-field (samayakṣetra) and the non-time-field (asamayakṣetra).
The cycle of light (jyoti chakra) is active up to two and a half islands (aḍhai
dvip), and due to this, time is experienced in this region. Therefore, this
region is called the time-field. Beyond this, there is no division of time, and
hence it is called the non-time-field. This statement should be understood from
the perspective of vyavaharanaya.  **The functions of the Kāla substance are:**
* **Vartana (existence)** * **Pariṇāma (transformation)** * **Kriyā (action)** *
**Paratva-aparattva (being the cause and effect)**  **References:**  1.
**Ā-samantāt sarvāṇyapi dravyāṇi kāśante-dīpyante'tra vyavasthitānītyākāśam** -
All substances are illuminated and manifested in it. This is Akasa. 2.
**Ākāśasyāvagāhaḥ** - The characteristic of Akasa is providing space. 3. **Prati
kālasyākhyā, praddhā cāso samaya pradhāsamayaḥ, athavā pradāyā samyo nivībhago
bhāgo'ddhāsamayaḥ** - The name of time is pradha, and the time of pradha is
adha-samaya. Alternatively, the smallest indivisible part of time is adha-
samaya. 4. **Vartanāpariṇāmakriyāparatvāparatve ca kālasya** - The functions of
Kāla are existence, transformation, action, and being the cause and effect.

[16] The cause of the origin of the Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra is the act of
"vartana" (activity). The abandonment of the previous state and the adoption of
the subsequent state is the result. The act of "parispandana" (pulsation) is the
action, and the relationship of "jyeshtatva" (seniority) and "kanishtatva"
(juniority), "paratva" (exteriority) and "aparatva" (interiority) is the state.
There is no consensus among all the Acharyas regarding the acceptance of time as
an independent substance. Some Acharyas consider it an independent substance,
while others say that time is not an independent substance, but rather the flow
of the states of Jiva and other substances.  The argument of the Acharyas who
consider time as an independent substance is that just as Jiva and Pudgala,
despite having the nature of motion and rest, are considered as "nimitta-karana"
(instrumental cause) for that action, in the same way, Jiva and Ajiva, despite
having the nature of "paryaya-parinaman" (state transformation), should be
considered as "nimitta-karana" for that transformation. Otherwise, there is no
logic in considering "dharma-astikaya" and "adharma-astikaya" as instrumental
causes. This view is accepted in the Digambara tradition.  The argument of the
side that does not consider time as an independent substance is that "paryaya-
parinaman" is the action of Jiva and Ajiva, which happens without the influence
of any other substance. Therefore, in reality, the collection of states of Jiva
and Ajiva should be called time. Time is not an independent substance. Both
these views are mentioned in the Svetambara tradition.  Thus, the ten "arupi
ajiva" (formless non-living) should be understood as: "skandha, desha, pradesha"
of "dharma-astikaya"; "skandha, desha, pradesha" of "adharma-astikaya"; and
"skandha, desha, pradesha" and "addha-samaya" of "akasha-astikaya".  Four types
of "rupi ajiva" (formful non-living) are mentioned: "skandha, desha, pradesha"
and "paramanu-pudgala".  Due to the infinity of "pudgala-skandha", the plural
form is used in the original text. As it is said, "The 'pudgala-astikaya' is
infinite due to the substance."  The "skandha-desha" are the divisions of
"skandha" that are conceived by intellect, such as "dvi-pradeshi" (two-
dimensional). The "skandha-pradesha" are the undivided parts that are found in
the "skandha". The "pudgala-paramanu" is the independent undivided part that is
devoid of "skandha-parinaman" (transformation of "skandha"). The meaning is that
the "paramanu" that are connected to "skandha" or "desha" are "pradesha", and
the "paramanu" that are independent of "skandha" or "desha" are "paramanu-
pudgala".  The only "pudgala" substance is "rupi ajiva". These "pudgala"
transform into five colors, two smells, five tastes, eight touches, and five
substances.  The "Prajnapanasutra" mentions the options that arise due to the
mutual relationship of these colors, smells, tastes, touches, and substances. It
is relevant to mention them briefly here.  It is as follows: There are 20
"boles" (combinations) in the substances that have five colors: black, green,
red, yellow, and white - 2 smells, 5 tastes, 8 touches, and 5 substances.
Therefore, there are 20 x 45 = 100 types of "varna-ashrita" (color-based).
There are 23 "boles" in the "surabhi-gandha" (pleasant smell) and "durabhi-
gandha" (unpleasant smell) - 5 colors, 5 tastes, 8 touches, and 5 substances.
Therefore, there are 23 x 42 = 46 types of "gandha-ashrita" (smell-based).  1.

## First Understanding: The Nature and Types of Ajiva [17]  **Rasa-based:**
There are 5 colors, 2 smells, 8 touches, and 5 forms in the five tastes (sweet,
bitter, pungent, sour, and astringent). These 20 elements can be combined in
20^4 * 5 = 100 ways, resulting in 100 rasa-based variations.  **Guru-Laghu-
Sparsha-based:** There are 5 colors, 2 smells, 5 tastes, 6 touches (excluding
guru and laghu), and 5 forms in the guru and laghu touches. These 23 elements
can be combined in 23^4 * 2 = 46 ways, resulting in 46 guru-laghu-sparsha-based
variations. The same applies to the cold and hot touches, resulting in another
46 variations. The difference is that we should consider only six touches out of
the eight, excluding cold and hot.  **Snigdha, Rooksha, Komala, and Kathira-
based:**  Similarly, considering six touches each in snigdha, ruksha, komala,
and kathira, we get 23 variations each. This results in 23^4 * 4 = 92
variations.  **Total Sparsha-based variations:** 46 + 46 + 92 = 184
**Sansthana-based:** There are 5 colors, 2 smells, 5 tastes, and 9 touches in
the five forms (circle, triangle, square, rectangle, and oval). These 20
elements can be combined in 20^4 * 5 = 100 ways, resulting in 100 sansthana-
based variations.  **Total Ajiva variations:** 100 (varna-based) + 46 (gandha-
based) + 100 (rasa-based) + 184 (sparsha-based) + 100 (sansthana-based) = 530
**Arupa Ajiva:**  We have previously mentioned 10 variations of arupa ajiva,
including dharma-astikaya, etc., and their skandha, desha, pradesha, etc. There
are also 20 variations based on the dravya, kshetra, and kala guna of dharma-
astikaya, adharma-astikaya, prakasha-astikaya, and kala. Therefore, there are 10
+ 20 = 30 variations of arupa ajiva.  **Total Ajiva variations:** 530 (rupa
ajiva) + 30 (arupa ajiva) = 560  The duration of the result of varna, etc., is
from the shortest, one moment, to the longest, countless moments.  This
completes the explanation of Ajiva-abhigma.  **The Nature and Types of Jiva-
abhigma**  **6. What is Jiva-abhigma?**  Jiva-abhigma is of two types: Samsara-
samavrannaka-jiva-abhigma and Asamsara-samavrannaka-jiva-abhigma.  **7. What is

[18] What is the **Jivaabhigam** (approach to the soul) that is
**Asansarasamavannag** (not associated with the cycle of birth and death)? There
are two types of **Asansarasamavannag Jivaabhigam**: **Anantar सिद्ध**
(immediately attained) **Asansarasamavannag Jivaabhigam** and **Parampar सिद्ध**
(gradually attained) **Asansarasamavannag Jivaabhigam**.  How many types of
**Anantar सिद्ध Asansarasamavannag Jivaabhigam** are there? There are fifteen
types of **Anantar सिद्ध Asansarasamavannag Jivaabhigam**, such as **Tithth
सिद्ध** (liberated by the Tirthankara) to **Anek सिद्ध** (liberated by many).
This is the explanation of **Anantar सिद्ध Asansarasamavannag Jivaabhigam**.
What is **Parampar सिद्ध Asansarasamavannag Jivaabhigam**? There are many types
of **Parampar सिद्ध Asansarasamavannag Jivaabhigam**, such as **Prathamasamay
सिद्ध** (liberated in the first time period), **Dvitiyasamay सिद्ध** (liberated
in the second time period) to **Anantasamay सिद्ध** (liberated in the infinite
time period). This is the explanation of **Parampar सिद्ध Asansarasamavannag
Jivaabhigam**.  This is the complete explanation of **Asansarasamavannag
Jivaabhigam**.  After discussing **Ajivabhigam** (approach to non-soul), the
**Jivaabhigam** is discussed in these sutras.  Although all this is a discussion
of **Jiva** (soul) and **Ajiv** (non-soul), the term "**abhigam**" is added to
both to indicate that these souls and non-souls possess the quality of being
**abhigamy** (knowable). In other words, these souls and non-souls are objects
of knowledge (**jney**).  Advaita (non-dualist) philosophers believe that the
soul is not an object of knowledge.  The term "**abhigam**" is added to **Jiva**
and **Ajiv** to refute this view.  If the soul is not an object of knowledge,
then it cannot be understood. And without knowing its true nature, how can one
attain liberation from the cycle of birth and death and progress towards
**moksha** (liberation)? In this way, the purpose of scriptural composition
would become meaningless.

## First Understanding: The Nature and Types of Jivaabhigam  This section
discusses the nature of Jivaabhigam by explaining the different types of Jivas
and their characteristics.  Jivaabhigam is of two types: Samsarasamaapannk and
Asamsarasamaapannk.  * **Samsarasamaapannk:** Knowledge of Jivas who are bound
to the cycle of birth and death (Samsara). * **Asamsarasamaapannk:** Knowledge
of Jivas who have attained liberation (Moksha) and are free from Samsara.
Samsara refers to the cycle of birth and death in the four realms of existence:
Narak (hell), Tiryanch (animal), Manushya (human), and Dev (heaven). Jivas who
are bound to these realms are Samsarasamaapannk. Jivas who have attained
liberation from this cycle are Asamsarasamaapannk.  Whether a Jiva is bound to
Samsara or liberated, they share the same fundamental nature of being a Jiva.
This implies that even in liberation, the Jiva continues to exist.  Some
philosophers believe that just as a lamp extinguishes and ceases to exist upon
being extinguished, a Jiva ceases to exist upon attaining liberation. Similarly,
Vaisheshik Darshan believes that liberation occurs when the nine Atmagunas
(qualities of the soul) like Buddhi (intellect) are destroyed. This section
refutes these beliefs.  If a Jiva ceases to exist upon liberation, or if its
Atmagunas like Buddhi, Sukh (happiness), etc. are destroyed, then who would
strive for such liberation? Who would seek to destroy themselves? Who would
desire to become devoid of happiness? In such a scenario, liberation itself
would be destroyed.  Due to brevity, the section primarily focuses on
Asamsarasamaapannk Jivas.  There are two types of Asamsarasamaapannk Jivas:
Anantar Siddha and Parampar Siddha.  * **Anantar Siddha:** Siddhas who attained
liberation immediately upon their last birth. There is no time gap between their
last birth and their attainment of Siddhatva (liberation). * **Parampar
Siddha:** Siddhas who attained liberation after a period of time, whether it be
two, three, or even an infinite number of lifetimes.  There are 15 types of
Anantar Siddhas:  1. **Tirth Siddha:** A Tirth is a place or a path that leads
one across the ocean of Samsara. In this context, the teachings of the
Tirthankara and the fourfold order of Shramanas established by them are
considered a Tirth. The first Ganadhar (disciple) is also considered a Tirth.
Those who attain Siddhatva after the establishment of the Tirth by the
Tirthankara are called Tirth Siddhas. Examples include Gautam, Sudharma, and
Jambu. 2. **Atirth Siddha:** Those who attain Siddhatva before the establishment
of a Tirth or after its dissolution are called Atirth Siddhas. For example,
Marudevi Mata attained Siddhatva before the establishment of the Tirth by
Bhagwan Rishabhdev. During the time between the Tirthankaras like Suvidhinath,
the Tirth was dissolved. Those who attained Siddhatva during this time by
remembering their past lives and attaining knowledge of the path to liberation
are called Atirth Siddhas.  **Note:** The text ends abruptly, leaving the
remaining types of Anantar Siddhas and further discussion incomplete.

establishing a Tirtha are Tīrthankarasiddhas / For example, in this Avasarpini
Kāla, from Ṛṣabhadev to Mahāvīra Svāmī, twenty-four Tīrthankaras are
Tīrthankarasiddhas. 4. Pratīrthankarasiddha - Those who become Siddhas after
being ordinary Kevalis are Atīrthankarasiddhas / For example, an ordinary
Kevali. 5. Svayambaddha Siddha - Those who become Siddhas by attaining
enlightenment through their own knowledge of jātismaraṇa etc. without the
teachings of another are Svayambaddha Siddhas / For example, Nāmirajṛṣi / / 6.
Pratiyakbuddhasiddha - Those who become Siddhas by attaining enlightenment on
their own after seeing any external cause are Pratiyakbuddhasiddhas / For
example, Karakaṇḍu etc. / Although both Svayambaddha and Pratiyakbuddhasiddhas
attain enlightenment without the teachings of another, there is a difference
between them in terms of the external cause. Svayambuddhas attain enlightenment
without any external cause, while Pratiyakbuddhas attain enlightenment after
seeing external causes like a bull, cloud, tree etc. ' Svayambuddhas and
Pratiyakbuddhas also differ in terms of their Upādhi, Śruta and Linga. There are
two types of Svayambuddhas - Tīrthankara and different from Tīrthankara /
Tīrthankaras fall under Tīrthankarasiddhas, therefore, here one should
understand the authority of Svayambuddhas different from Tīrthankaras.
Svayambuddhas have twelve types of Upādhi, while Pratiyakbuddhas have two types
at the lowest and nine types at the highest, excluding Vastra. Svayambuddhas
have both Pūrvādhiita Śruta and not. If they have it, then the Devatā provides
them with a Veṣa (Linga) or they go to a Guru and wear the Muni Veṣa / If they
are capable of living alone and desire to live alone, then they live alone,
otherwise, they live as Gacchvāsīs / If they do not have Pūrvādhiita Śruta, then
according to the rule, they live as Gacchvāsīs wearing the Muni Veṣa in the
presence of a Guru. Pratiyakbuddhas have Pūrvādhiita Śruta according to the rule
/ At the lowest, eleven Angas and at the highest, ten Pūrvādhiita Śruta is less
than the previous / The Devatā gives them the Munilinga or they may also remain
without a Linga. 7. Buddhabodhitasiddha - Those who become Siddhas after
attaining enlightenment from a teacher etc. are Buddhabodhitasiddhas / For
example, Jambū etc. 1. Patteya - Buddhas who contemplate the external cause like
a bull etc. and attain enlightenment through external perception are Patteya
Buddhas. Patteya Buddhas have two types of rules at the lowest and nine types at
the highest, according to the rule, they are Pauṛaṇavajja / Svayambuddhas have
Pūrvādhiita Śruta, if they do not have it, then they wear the Linga according to
the rule in the presence of a Guru, if they are capable of living alone and
desire to do so, then they live alone, otherwise, they live in a Gaccha /

## First Understanding: The Nature and Types of Moksha-attainment [21 8.
**Female-Ling Siddha:** Those who attain Siddhahood while in a female body are
called Female-Ling Siddha. Examples include Malli Tirthankara, Marudevi, etc.  *
**Ling** (gender) is of three types: Veda, Body-structure, and Dress. * Here,
the body-structure aspect of Ling is relevant, not Veda or Dress. * Veda arises
from the emergence of Mohkarma (delusion-karma). * Siddhahood cannot be attained
while Mohkarma persists. * Dress has no connection to liberation. * Therefore,
the focus here is on the female body.  The Digambar tradition believes that
liberation cannot be attained in a female body. However, the term "Female-Ling
Siddha" acknowledges the possibility of female liberation. There is no logical
or scriptural basis for the belief that women cannot attain liberation.
Liberation is not linked to body structure but to the excellence of knowledge,
vision, and conduct.  Why can't a female body achieve excellence in knowledge,
vision, and conduct? Like men, women can also achieve excellence in these areas.
The Digambar tradition considers clothing a restriction on conduct, and since
women cannot renounce clothing, they have denied them liberation. However, a
neutral perspective reveals that clothing itself is not a restriction on
conduct. Attachment to clothing is the restriction. If there is attachment to
the body even without clothing, then renouncing the body would be necessary for
conduct.  Since the body cannot be renounced, can conduct not be followed? The
conclusion is that simply wearing clothing does not affect conduct. The
scriptures refer to "Moorti" (form) as "Parigraha" (attachment), not objects.
Therefore, denying women the excellence of conduct due to their not renouncing
clothing, and consequently denying them liberation, is not logical or
scriptural.  **9. Male-Ling Siddha:** Those who attain Siddhahood while in a
male body are called Male-Ling Siddha.  **10. Neuter-Ling Siddha:** Those who
attain Siddhahood while in a neuter body, different from male and female, are
called Neuter-Ling Siddha.  * Artificial neuters can attain Siddhahood, but
natural neuters cannot.  **11. Self-Ling Siddha:** Those who attain Siddhahood
while in the attire of a Jain monk, including the practice of Rajoharan
(menstrual purification), are called Self-Ling Siddha.  **12. Other-Ling
Siddha:** Those who attain Siddhahood while in the attire of other religions,
such as Parivrajaka, Sannyasi, Gerupa, or those wearing clothes, are called
Other-Ling Siddha.  **13. Householder-Ling Siddha:** Those who attain Siddhahood
while in the attire of a householder are called Householder-Ling Siddha. For
example, Marudevi Mata.  **14. One-Siddha:** Those who attain Siddhahood alone
at a single time are called One-Siddha.  **1. Lingam cha triviham - Vedoh

## [23 First Understanding: Approach to the World-Bound Soul]  Those who have
attained the state of liberation, who are known as the "Three-Time-Liberated"
and "Secondless-Time-Liberated" should be understood. Similarly, one should
understand further. This is the statement of the approach to the world-bound
soul.  What is the approach to the world-bound soul? In the world-bound souls,
these nine understandings are stated as follows:  1. Some say that there are two
types of world-bound souls. 2. Some say that there are three types of world-
bound souls. 3. Some say that there are four types of world-bound souls. 4. Some
say that there are five types of world-bound souls. 5-10. In this way, one
should continue to state until some say that there are ten types of world-bound
souls.  **Explanation:**  This sutra presents a question and answer regarding
world-bound souls. The question is: What is the nature of the world-bound soul?
The answer is given by explaining the different types of world-bound souls. By
stating the different types, the nature of the object becomes clear.  Here, nine
understandings are presented regarding the types of world-bound souls. The
meaning of "understanding" is "statement" or "proposition." There are nine types
of propositions in this regard. For example, some teachers say that there are
two types of world-bound souls, while others say there are three types. In this
way, some teachers say that there are ten types of world-bound souls.  From two
to ten types of world-bound souls - these are nine types of statements or
propositions. It should be noted that these nine types of statements, while
different from each other, are not contradictory. The teachers who say that
there are two types of world-bound souls, also say, with a different intention,
that there are three types of world-bound souls, and with another intention,
four types, and so on, until, with a different intention, they say that there
are ten types.

## 24] There are ten types of Jivaanivaabhigam / There is a difference in
statements due to the difference in Vivaksha, but there is no contradiction in
them. The Jivas, which are of two types, are also of three types from another
perspective, four from another, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten types.
Therefore, there is no contradiction in these nine types of Prathipattis / They
are all correct and Samyag from different perspectives. The Vrittikar has also
said in the context of the word 'Prathipatti' that Prathipatti is not only in
the form of words but also that which leads to meaning through words. The
Shabdavadvaadis believe that 'Shabdamatram Vishvam' / The whole world is only in
the form of words, believing this will only prove the word, not the world /
Therefore, the said belief is beyond truth. The truth is that the meaning is
stated through words, only then can Prathipatti (knowledge) happen. Syadvad or
Apekhavaad is the lifeblood of Jain principles. Therefore, the truth should be
understood keeping in mind the expectations of Nay-Nikshep. The object is
Anantdharmatmak. It is not one-sided and uniform. If the object is considered to
be completely uniform, then the diversity of the world will not be consistent.
The statement of the first Prathipatti is 9. Tatha Gan Je Evamhansu 'Duviha
Sansarasamaavagnaga Jivaa Pagnata' Te Evamhansu Tan Jahatasa Chev Thavara Chev
// [9] Those who state that there are two types of Sansarasamaapanak Jivas, they
say that they are of two types due to the difference between As and Thavara. 10.
Se Ki Tan Thavara? Yaavara Tiviha Pannaata, Tan Jaha1. Pudhavikaaiyaa 2.
Aukkaaiyaa 3. Vanassaiikaaiyaa / [10] What is called Thavara? Thavara has been
said to be of three types - . Yatha - 1. Prithvikaayik 2. Apkaayik and 3.
Vanaspatikaayik / Discussion - In this Sutra, while describing the first
Prathipatti out of the nine Prathipattis that describe the difference in
Sansarasamaapanna Jivas, it is said that Sansaravarti Jivas are of two types -
Pras and Thavara / All the beings of the world are included in these two
differences. According to the etymology of 'Santiti Sa', those Jivas who can
move from one place to another are called As. Those Jivas who move from one
place to another due to being heated by the heat or who go to the sun due to
fear of cold, are the Jivas who can move around. Jivas who have the Asnaamakarm
Uday are called As, from this perspective, Dwiindriya, Triindriya, Chaturindriya
and Panchendriya Jivas come under As.

[The First Understanding of the Term "Tras"] [25 It is noteworthy here that in
the Pragama, Tejaskaaya and Vayukaaya have been considered under the category of
Tras. In the same Jivaabhigamsutra, it is further stated that - "Tras are of
three types: Tejaskaaya, Vayukaaya and Audarik Tras beings." In the
Tattvarthsutra also, it is said that "Tejovaayudvindraadiyashcha Trasah". / 2
Elsewhere, they have been called "Sthavar". The consistency of these two types
of statements should be understood as follows - There are two types of
interpretations regarding living beings. In the first interpretation, those
beings who can move from one place to another with intention and understanding,
and who have the emergence of Asanama Karma, are called Tras beings, and in this
interpretation, Dwindraadi beings come under the category of Tras, not Tejas and
Vayu. In the second interpretation, those beings who move upwards or sideways
with or without intention, are called Tras. According to this explanation and
interpretation, Tejas and Vayu move upwards or sideways, therefore they are
Tras. Such Tras beings have been called "Gatitras". The implication is that when
only the interpretation of motion is considered, then Tejas and Vayu are counted
among Tras. / But when the interpretation of the emergence of Sthavar Nama Karma
is considered, then they are counted among Sthavar. Tejas and Vayu do not have
the emergence of Asanama Karma, but they have the emergence of Sthavar Nama
Karma. Therefore, the consistency of both types of statements should be
understood from the difference in interpretation. Sthavar -
"Tishthantityevamshila: Sthavarah" / Those who are unable to leave that place
even when they are burnt by heat, etc., and remain there; such beings are called
Sthavar. Here, three types of Sthavar beings have been mentioned - 1.
Prithvikaaya 2. Apkaaya and 3. Vanaspatikaaya / Generally, five types of Sthavar
are counted. Tejas and Vayu are also considered Sthavar due to the emergence of
Sthavar Nama Karma. But here, due to the interpretation of Gatitras, only three
types of Sthavar beings have been mentioned by counting Tejas and Vayu among
Tras. The same has been said in the Tattvarthsutra - "Prithivyambubanaspatiyah
Sthavarah" / / 1. Prithvikaaya - Those beings whose body is earth, are
Prithvikaayik. / Those who consider the earth as a deity, this statement refutes
them. The earth is not a single living being, but a community of countless
living beings. As it is said in the Agama - the earth is said to be "Sachitt",
it has many separate living beings. / 2. Apkaaya - Those beings whose body is
water, are Apkaayik beings. / 3. Vanaspatikaaya - Those beings whose body is a
plant, are Vanaspatikaayik beings. 1. Tasa Tiviha Pannaatta Tan Jaha Teukaaiyaa,

The Earth is the foundation of everything, therefore it is the first to be
taken. Water is based on the Earth, therefore water is taken after the Earth.
According to the principle "Jattha Jalam Tattha Vanam", wherever there is water,
there is vegetation. Therefore, vegetation is taken after water. In this way,
the order of Earth, water, and vegetation is established.  The nature of Earth-
bodied beings is described as follows: What are Earth-bodied beings? Earth-
bodied beings are said to be of two types: subtle Earth-bodied beings and gross
Earth-bodied beings. What are subtle Earth-bodied beings? Subtle Earth-bodied
beings are said to be of two types: sufficient and insufficient.  Discussion:
Earth-bodied beings are said to be of two types: 1. Subtle Earth-bodied beings
and 2. Gross Earth-bodied beings. Subtle Earth-bodied beings refer to those who
have arisen from the subtle karma, not from relative subtlety or grossness like
berries and gooseberries. Those beings whose bodies cannot be seen by the naked
eye due to the arising of subtle karma are subtle beings. These subtle beings
are present everywhere in the fourteen-stringed universe. There is no place in
this universe where subtle beings are not present. Just as kajal is packed
tightly in a kajal bottle, or just as fragrance is present everywhere in a
perfume box, in the same way, subtle beings are packed tightly in the entire
universe - they are present everywhere.  These subtle beings do not encounter
any resistance. They pass through even the hard rock of a mountain. These subtle
beings do not die when killed, they do not get pierced when pierced, they do not
get broken when broken. They do not encounter any harm or resistance from any
object in the world.  These subtle Earth-bodied beings, who have arisen from the
subtle karma, are present everywhere in the universe. Gross Earth-bodied beings
- those Earth-bodied beings whose bodies (when many come together) can be
perceived by the naked eye, who encounter harm and resistance, who die when
killed, 1. "Pudhavi Chittamantam Akkhaya, Anega Jiwa, Pudho Sattha Prasnattha

## First Understanding: Description of Earth-bodied Beings [27]  **Earth-bodied
beings are those who are pierced by piercing, broken by breaking, and are
dull.** They exist only in the reflected region of the universe, not everywhere.
The two "chakar" mentioned in the original text indicate the many subtle and
dull distinctions.  **Subtle Earth-bodied beings are of two types:**  1.
**Sufficient:** Those who have fulfilled their sufficiencies. 2.
**Insufficient:** Those who have not fulfilled their sufficiencies or are not
going to fulfill them.  To understand the nature of sufficient and insufficient,
it is necessary to understand sufficiencies.  **Sufficiency is the power of the
soul to take in food and other karmic particles and transform them into body and
other forms.** This power is obtained through the accumulation of karmic
particles. Upon reaching their place of origin, beings first take in certain
karmic particles and continue to take in others, transforming them into body,
senses, breath, speech, and mind. The power to transform karmic particles into
these forms is called sufficiency.  **There are six types of sufficiencies:**
1. **Food Sufficiency:** The power by which a being takes in food and transforms
it into essence and waste (spread portion). 2. **Body Sufficiency:** The power
by which a being transforms food into essence, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow,
and semen, the seven bodily elements. 3. **Sense Sufficiency:** The power by
which a being takes in karmic particles suitable for the senses from the seven
bodily elements and transforms them into senses. 4. **Breath Sufficiency:** The
power by which a being takes in karmic particles suitable for breathing and
transforms them into inhalation and exhalation. 5. **Speech Sufficiency:** The
power by which a being takes in karmic particles suitable for speech and
transforms them into speech. 6. **Mind Sufficiency:** The power by which a being
takes in karmic particles suitable for the mind and transforms them into mind.
**1. Sufficiency is a special power of the soul to take in food and other karmic
particles and transform them.** - Malayagiri Vatti

## Translation:  **[28] The order and time of the *Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra*
perfections:**  All perfections begin simultaneously, but their completion
occurs at different times. First, the *Ahar-Paryapti* (food perfection) is
completed, followed by the *Sharira* (body), *Indriya* (sense organs), *Shwaso-
chchwas* (breathing), *Bhasha* (speech), and *Manah-Paryapti* (mind perfection)
in order. Each subsequent perfection is more subtle than the previous one. Just
as six people sitting together spinning thread, the one who spins finer thread
will take longer than the one who spins coarser thread.   *Ahar-Paryapti* is the
most gross, and *Manah-Paryapti* is the most subtle. The time for *Ahar-
Paryapti* is one moment. It is completed in one moment. The proof of this is
found in the *Prajnapana* (scripture) in the section on food, where it is asked:
"Is an *aparyapt* (imperfect) being with *Ahar-Paryapti* a *praharak* (eater) or
an *anahaarak* (non-eater)?" The answer is that it is not a *praharak*, but an
*anahaarak*. An *aparyapt* being with *Ahar-Paryapti* is only in the *vigrah-
gati* (state of disintegration) and is not found in the *upapat-kshetra* (realm
of rebirth). A being who has entered the *upapat-kshetra* is a *praharak* from
the very first moment. This proves that the time of completion of *Ahar-
Paryapti* is one moment. If it were still *aparyapt* with *Ahar-Paryapti* even
after entering the *upapat-kshetra*, then the *Prajnapana* would have answered,
"Perhaps a *praharak* and perhaps an *anahaarak*," as it has done for the
*Sharira* (body) and other perfections.  After this, the *Sharira* (body) and
other perfections are completed one by one in each *antar-muhurt* (sub-moment).
The time of completion of all perfections is also *antar-muhurt* proof, because
*antar-muhurt* is also of many types.  **How many perfections for each type of
being?**  * **Ekaindriya** (one-sense) beings have four perfections: 1. *Ahar*,
2. *Sharira*, 3. *Indriya*, and 4. *Shwaso-chchwas*. * **Dwiindriya** (two-
sense), **Triindriya** (three-sense), **Chaturindriya** (four-sense), and
**Asanjnī Panchendriya** (non-conscious five-sense) beings have five
perfections: the previous four and *Bhasha-Paryapti* (speech perfection). *
**Sanjnī Panchendriya** (conscious five-sense) beings have all six perfections.
*Ahar*, *Sharira*, and *Indriya* - these three perfections are completed by
every being. Only after completing these can a being bind the *prayu* (karma) of
the next birth. No being can die without binding the *ay* (karma) of the next
birth.  In relation to these three perfections, every being is *paryapt*
(perfect). However, the division of *paryapt* and *aparyapt* is not based on
these three perfections, but on the completion or incompletion of the
perfections specific to each type of being.  **Those who complete their own
perfections are *paryapt* beings, and those who do not complete their own
perfections are *aparyapt* beings.** For example, a *Ekaindriya* being has four
perfections. An *Ekaindriya* being who completes these four perfections is
*paryapt*, and one who does not complete them is *aparyapt*.  **There are two
types of *paryapt* beings:**  1. **Labdhi-Paryapt:** A being who has not yet
completed its own perfections but will definitely complete them in the future.
2. **Karan-Paryapt:** A being who has completed its own perfections.

## First Understanding: Description of Earth-bodied Beings  [29] There are two
types of insufficient beings: 1. **Labdhi-aparapti** and 2. **Karan-aparapti**.
A being who has not fulfilled its own appropriate **paryapti** and will not do
so in the future, meaning it will die insufficient, is **Labdhi-aparapti**.   A
being who has not fulfilled its own appropriate **paryapti** but will do so in
the future is **Karan-aparapti**.   Thus, due to the difference between
**paryapti** and **aparapti** in subtle earth-bodied beings, there are two
types.  To further explain the subtle earth-bodied beings, two **sangrahani**
verses are given here:  > **"Sarirogahana sanghayana santhana kasaya taha hanthi
sannao. Lesidiya samugdhaae sanni bee ya pajjatti."** // 1 // > **"Vitthi san
naane joguvanoge taha ki mahare / Ubavaay thii samugghyaay chavan gairaagai
cheva."** // 2 //  Further, the subtle earth-bodied beings will be described
through 23 **dwaras**. These 30 **dwaras** are: 1. **Sharira**, 2.
**Avagahana**, 3. **Sanhanan**, 4. **Sansthan**, 5. **Kasaya**, 6. **Sanjna**,
7. **Leshya**, 8. **Indriya**, 9. **Samudghta**, 10. **Sanji-asanji**, 11.
**Ved**, 12. **Paryapti**, 13. **Drishti**, 14. **Darshan**, 15. **Jnana**, 16.
**Yoga**, 17. **Upayoga**, 18. **Ahar**, 19. **Upapat**, 20. **Sthiti**, 21.
**Samavahat-asamavahat maran**, 22. **Chyavan**, and 23. **Gati-pragati**.  The
following sutras will discuss these 23 **dwaras** through questions and answers.
Following the principle of "**Yathouddesha tatha nirdhesha**", the first
discussion will be about **Sharira** and other **dwaras** in order:  [1] **"Tesi
nan bhanta! Jiwaanam kati sariraya pannta? Goyama! To sariraga pannta, tanjaha-
oralie, teyaye, kammae."**   [1] **"O Bhagavan! How many bodies are described
for these subtle earth-bodied beings?"**   **"Gautama! Three bodies are
described, such as 1. Audarik, 2. Taijas, and 3. Karman."**  [2] **"Tesi nan
bhanta! Jiwaanam kemahaaliya sarirogahana pannta? Goyama! Jahannenam
angulasankhejjahbhagam ukkosenavi angulasankhejjai bhagam."**  [2] **"O
Bhagavan! How big is the **avagahana** of the body of these beings?"**
**"Gautama! The smallest is an immeasurable part of an angul, and the largest is
also an immeasurable part of an angul."**

[36] [Jiva-jiva-abhigamsutra] They, by changing, removing, shaking off, and
destroying the old (previous) color qualities or touch qualities of those
ingested pudgalas, produce other unprecedented color qualities, odor qualities,
taste qualities, and touch qualities in them, and they take the pudgalas that
are deeply attached to the soul-body from all the soul-regions. / [16] "O
Venerable One! From where do the jivas arise?" / "Do they arise from hell, from
the animal realm, from humans, or from gods?" / "Gautama! They do not arise from
hell, they arise from the animal realm, they arise from humans, they do not
arise from gods. They arise from the animal realm, then they arise from all the
animal realms except those with an infinite lifespan in the realm of enjoyment.
They arise from humans, then they arise from all humans except those who are in
the state of non-action and those with an infinite lifespan." / "Thus, one
should speak of the reverse-arising." / [19] "Venerable One! How long is the
duration of the jivas?" / "Gautama! Their duration is from an antarmukha to an
antarmukha, from the lowest to the highest." / [20] "Venerable One! Do the jivas
die with or without attachment to the death-approaching assault?" / "Gautama!
They die both with and without attachment to the death-approaching assault." /

## Translation:  **Ganadhara Gautama, renowned for his exceptional achievements
like "Sarvaaksharasannipaati" and "Sanbhinna Shrotolābhi," could describe
countless past lives when asked. Why would such a knowledgeable soul like Lord
Gautama ask simple questions? Three explanations have been offered to address
this curiosity.**  **Firstly, Lord Gautama knew everything and shared his
knowledge with his disciples. However, to instill faith in his disciples, he
would ask questions to receive answers from the Lord.**  **Secondly, the
"Dvadaśāṅgī" and other scriptures contain numerous instances of Ganadharas
asking questions and the Lord providing answers. Therefore, the author of the
sutras has structured the sutras in this format.**  **Thirdly, even though there
were fourteen "Pūrva-dharas" before him, Lord Gautama was still a "Chhadmastha"
(one who conceals his knowledge). Even a "Chhadmastha" might have some
"Anabhoga" (non-utilization) of knowledge. Therefore, it is appropriate for him
to ask questions to confirm the truth and receive the Lord's validation.**
**Lord Gautama asked, "O Supremely Blessed One! How many bodies do the subtle
earth-bodied beings have?"**  **Lord Mahavira, addressing Gautama Swami with the
renowned "Gautama" lineage, responded in a way that filled Gautama Swami's mind
with joy and delight.**  **It is a psychological fact that mentioning the
extraordinary qualities of an inquirer inspires them to understand the subject
matter better.**  **1. Body-Gate: The Lord said, "The subtle earth-bodied beings
have three bodies: Audārika, Tanjas, and Kārmaṇa."**  **Generally, there are
five bodies: 1. Audārika, 2. Vaikriya, 3. Prāhārak, 4. Tejas, and 5. Kārmaṇa.
Audārika, meaning "Udar" (generous) or "Pradhan" (principal), is made up of the
finest "Pudgalas" (particles). It should be understood in comparison to the
bodies of Tirthankaras and Ganadharas.**  **Compared to the bodies of
Tirthankaras and Ganadharas, the bodies of the "Anuttara Vimāna" (highest
celestial beings) are infinitely superior.**  **Alternatively, "Udar" means
"Brihat" (large). It is called "Audārika" because it is larger than the other
bodies. The Audārika body is a few thousand "Yojanas" (a unit of distance) in
size.**  **This is in comparison to the "Brihattar" (innate) "Bhavadhāraniya"
(earth-bound) "Vaikriya" body.**  **Otherwise, the "Uttara Vaikriya" (higher
Vaikriya) body can be a million "Yojanas" in size.**  **1. "Sankaatīte vi bhave
sāhai jamba paro u puchchhezja / Na ya ṇam aṇāiseesī viyāṇai es chhaumatyō."**
**2. "Nahi nāmanābhōgaśchhadmasthasyēha kasyachinnāsti / Shānāvaraṇīyaṁ hi
jñānāvaraṇaprakṛti karma."**

## First Understanding: Description of Earth Body  **Or Audaric** - meaning
gross, is a body made of gross pudgals. A body that is subject to decay and
decomposition, that can be pierced and broken, that has skin, blood, flesh,
bones, etc., is an Audaric body.  **Vaikriya Body** - is a body that can be
transformed into various or specific forms. A body that can become many from
one, one from many, small from large, large from small, aerial from terrestrial
and terrestrial from aerial, visible from invisible and invisible from visible,
is a Vaikriya body.  This body is of two types: **Aupapatik** and
**Labdhipratyayik**.  **Aupapatik Vaikriya Body** - is the body that Devas and
Narakas receive at birth.  **Labdhijanaya Vaikriya Body** - is the body that
some specific humans acquire the power to create various forms due to the
influence of Labdhi.  **Badar Vayu Kayik Jivas** - are also considered to have
artificial Labdhijanaya Vaikriya bodies.  This body does not have blood, flesh,
bones, etc. It is also not subject to decay and decomposition.  Compared to
Audaric, its provinces are countless times more numerous but subtle.  **Aharak
Body** - is the body that the fourteen previous Tirthankaras create through
specific Labdhi for the purpose of seeing the Riddhi-Mahima of the Tirthankaras
and other similar purposes. It is said that for the purpose of animal
compassion, seeing Riddhi, knowing subtle substances, and removing doubts, the
fourteen previous Tirthankaras create a subtle body the size of a hand through
their special Labdhi and send it to the Tirthankara Bhagwan. This subtle body is
made of very auspicious, pure, white pudgals like a crystal stone. After
creating this body, the fourteen previous Tirthankaras wander in the Mahavideha
Adi Kshetra and send it to the Tirthankara Bhagwan. If the Tirthankara Bhagwan
has gone elsewhere from there, then a statue the size of a head emerges from
that hand-sized body, which reaches wherever the Tirthankara Bhagwan is. From
there, it receives answers to questions, etc., and enters the hand-sized body,
and that hand-sized body enters the body of the fourteen previous Tirthankaras.
This fulfills the purpose of the fourteen previous Tirthankaras. This entire
process takes place in one Antarmuhurt. This type of body creation is the Aharak
body. This Aharak body may not exist at all in the world. The time of its
absence is negligible, one time, and excellent, six months.  **Tejas Body** - is
the body that is luminous and is the cause of the digestion of the consumed
food, etc., and the cause of radiance. Just as a farmer supplies water to
different beds in the field, this body converts the consumed food into juice,
etc., and delivers it to the various organs. Through specific tapasya, some men
acquire the Labdhi to emit Tejo Leshya.

"The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra is obtained, its cause is also the Tejas-Sharira.
This is present in all worldly beings. Karma-Paramanu, mixed with Karma-Sharira
and Atma-Pradesha like milk and water, are transformed into the body form and
are called Karma-Sharira / Karma-Samuha is the Karma-Sharira / It is the root of
all other bodies / The remaining bodies exist only when Karma-Sharira exists /
When Karma-Sharira is destroyed, all bodies are destroyed. When the Jiva goes to
another motion, the Karma-Sharira along with Tejas remains with it. Due to its
ability, this Tejas-Karma-Sharira goes and comes in the motion, it is not
visible. Other-Tithikas also agree on this subject. They have said that - This
body, being subtle, is not visible while going and coming in the motion. Due to
its invisibility, its effect should not be considered. Out of the above five
bodies, the subtle Prithvi-Kayika Jivas have three bodies - Audarik, Tejas and
Karma / Vaikriya and Aharak are not theirs / Because these two are achievements
and by nature of existence, those Jivas are deprived of these achievements. 2.
Avagahana-Dwar-The height of the body is called Avagahana. It is of two types -
Jghanya and Utkrishta / The Avagahana of subtle Prithvi-Kayika Jivas is an
innumerable part of an Angul and the Utkrishta is also an innumerable part of an
Angul, but it should be known that the Avagahana is relatively more in the
Utkrishta position than the Jghanya position. 3. Sanhanan-Dwar - The special
structure of bones is called Sanhanan. They are six - Vajra-Rishabhanarach,
Rishabhanarach, Narach, Ardhanarach, Kilika and Sewart. Vajra-Rishabhanarach -
Vajra means Kilika. Rishabha means Pariveshtan-Patta and Narach means being
bound by Markat on both sides / It means that two bones are joined by Markat-
bandh on both sides, they are covered by a third bone-like Patta from above and
there is a Kilika piercing all three bones from above. This type of strong bone
structure is called Van-Rishabhanarach-Sanhanan. Rishabhanarach - Where there is
Markat-bandh, Patta but no Kilika, such bone structure is called Rishabhanarach.
Narach - Where the bones are joined only by Markat-bandh, it is Narach-Sanhanan.

## First Prostration: Description of the Earth Body [41]  **Ardha-Narach:** A
half-narach is where one side has a merktabandha and the other side has a
keelika.   **Keelika:** Where the bones are joined by nails.  **Sevarta
(Chhedati):** Where the bones are only joined together (without any binding of
nails, etc.), this is called sevarta or chhedati sanhanan.  Often, in humans and
other beings, this type of sanhanan requires oil massage, etc.  Among the six
types of sanhanan mentioned above, the final chhedavati or sevarta sanhanan is
said to be that of the subtle earth-bodied beings.   Although subtle earth-
bodied beings do not have bones in their audarik body, they possess the specific
power that would be present if they did have bones. Therefore, their sanhanan is
considered to be through treatment.   Subtle earth-bodied beings do have an
audarik body, and due to that body, they possess a specific subtle power.  **4.
Sansthanadwar:** Sansthan means form. There are six types of sansthan:  1.
**Samachaturasrasansthan:** When sitting cross-legged, the body has four equal
angles. The distance between both knees, both shoulders is equal. The distance
between the left knee and right shoulder, left shoulder and right knee is equal.
The distance from the seat to the skull is equal. This body form is called
samachaturasrasansthan.   Alternatively, according to the science of Samudrika
Shastra, a body with all its parts in proper proportion is called
samachaturasra.  2. **Nyagrodhaparimandalsansthan:** Nyagrodha means banyan
tree. A body where the upper part from the navel is full and the lower part is
deficient is called nyagrodhaparimandalsansthan.  3. **Sadisansthan:** Here,
sadi refers to the part below the navel. A body where the part below the navel
is full and the upper part is deficient is called sadisansthan.  4.
**Kubjasansthan:** A body where the arms, legs, head, etc. are fine, but the
chest, back, and stomach are deficient and crooked is called kubjasansthan.  5.
**Vamansansthan:** A body where the chest, back, stomach, etc. are full, but the
arms, legs, etc. are small is called vamansansthan.  6. **Hundasansthan:** A
body where all the parts are deficient, inauspicious, and deformed is called
hundasansthan.  In response to the question of which sansthan belongs to subtle
earth-bodied beings, it is said that their sansthan is like a lentil, moon-
shaped sansthan. This moon-shaped, lentil-like sansthan is the hundakansthan.
This form cannot exist in the other five sansthans. Therefore, it is included
only in the hundasansthan.  Apart from the six sansthans of beings, there is no
other sansthan.

## 42] The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra (principle of interaction between souls) does

a lentil in shape. / 5. Kashayadwar (doorway of passions) - The place where
beings are bound and suffer is called Kashay, which is the cycle of existence. /
The passions are the cause of beings' transmigration and wandering in the cycle
of existence. / There are four passions: anger, pride, deceit, and greed. / All
four passions are found in subtle earth-bodied beings. Although these passions
and their external signs are not visible in these beings, they are present due
to subtle effects. They are present due to the peculiarity of subtle effects
from non-enjoyment, even if they are not visible. 6. Sanjnaadwar (doorway of
consciousness) - There are two types of consciousness: 1. Knowledge-based
consciousness and 2. Experience-based consciousness. / Knowledge-based
consciousness is the five types of knowledge: Matijnana (perception),
Shrutajnana (scriptural knowledge), Avadhijnana (clairvoyance), Manahparyaya
(mind-reading), and Kevaljnana (omniscience). Experience-based consciousness is
the experience of the fruits of self-created, non-perceivable karma. Here,
experience-based consciousness is dominant because knowledge-based consciousness
is included in the doorway of knowledge. There are four types of experience-
based consciousness: 1. Aharasanjna (consciousness of food), 2. Bhayasanjna
(consciousness of fear), 3. Maithunasajna (consciousness of sexual desire), and
4. Parigrahasajna (consciousness of attachment). Aharasanjna is the desire for
food, which is the result of hunger-causing karma. Bhayasanjna is the fear that
arises from fear-causing karma. Maithunasajna is the desire for sexual pleasure
that arises from the awakening of the senses. Parigrahasajna is the attachment
that arises from greed. Aharasanjna etc. are forms of desire and arise from the
awakening of mohaniya karma (karma that causes delusion). These four types of
consciousness are present in subtle earth-bodied beings in an unmanifest form. /
7. Lenyaadwar (doorway of attachment) - The cause of the soul's attachment to
karma is Leshya. / Leshyas are the auspicious and inauspicious effects that
occur in the soul due to the proximity of substances like black, blue, etc. /
Just as a crystal gem has no color of its own, it is transparent, but it takes
on the color of the object placed near it, similarly, the auspicious and
inauspicious effects that arise in the soul due to the proximity of substances
like black, blue, etc. are called Leshyas. The scholars have described six types
of Leshyas: 1. Krishna Leshya (black), 2. Neel Leshya (blue), 3. Kapoot Leshya
(grey), 4. Tejo Leshya (radiant), 5. Padma Leshya (red), and 6. Shukla Leshya
(white). The scholars have explained the nature of these Leshyas through the
example of six men who eat jamun fruit. It is as follows: Six men lost their way
and sat under a jamun tree in the forest and began to think. One man said that
the tree should be uprooted. Another man said that it should not be uprooted but
the trunk should be cut. The third said that the large branches should be cut.

## First Chapter: Description of the Earth Body [43 should be taken]  The fourth
said, "Only the clusters of jamun should be broken." The fifth said, "Not all
clusters, only the ripe jamuns should be broken." The sixth said, "Why is there
a need to cut the trees, etc.? We are only interested in eating the jamuns, so
we should simply eat the jamuns that have fallen down." Just as there were six
different kinds of thoughts of these men, similarly, there are different streams
of results in the Leshyas.  The first three Leshyas, Krishna, Neel, and Kapoth,
are inauspicious, and the next three Leshyas, Tej, Padma, and Shukla, are
auspicious. Subtle Earth-bodied beings have only the three inauspicious Leshyas.
Devas are not born in the subtle beings. Therefore, only the first three Leshyas
are present in them.  ## 8. Sensory Doors  According to the etymology, "Indanaad
Indra," the soul is Indra because it is the supreme lord of all knowledge. Its
inseparable mark is the senses. There are five senses: the sense of hearing, the
sense of sight, the sense of smell, the sense of taste, and the sense of touch.
These five senses are of two types: Dravyaindriya and Bhavaindriya.
Dravyaindriya is also of two types: 1. Nirvritti Dravyaindriya and 2. Upakaran
Dravyaindriya.  Nirvritti means a separate structure made of Pudgal. This
Nirvrittiindriya is also of two types: external and internal. The outer ear,
etc., is external Nirvritti, and it does not have a fixed form. The ears of a
human being are on the sides of the eyes and at the level of the eyebrows, while
the ears of a horse are above the eyes, and their front parts are sharp. The
internal Nirvrittiindriya is the same for all beings. Regarding this, the Agam
says that the shape of the sense of hearing is like the fruit of Kadamba, the
shape of the sense of sight is like the moon-shaped lentil, the shape of the
sense of smell is like the Ati Muktak, the shape of the sense of taste is like a
hoof, and the shape of the sense of touch is of various kinds. In the sense of
touch, there is generally no distinction between external and internal. In the
Tattvarth's original commentary, this distinction is not considered.  Upakaran
means the special power of the internal Niti. External Nirvritti is like a
sword, and internal Nirvritti is like the edge of a sword, a purer group of
Pudgal. There is a slight difference between Upakaran Indriya and internal
Nirvritti Indriya, which is in the power and the powerful. Even if the internal
Nirvritti Indriya is present, if the Upakaran Indriya is destroyed, the object
is not perceived. For example, even if the internal Nirvritti Indriya is in the
form of Kadamba, if the power is destroyed by a very loud thunder, etc., the
sound is not heard.  1. Panthano Paribhattha Chappurisaa Adavimjhayaranmi

##  Translation:  **Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra**  **Bhaavendriya** are of two types:
1. **Labdhi** and 2. **Upayog**. The **kshayopa-shaya** of **aavaran** is
**Labdhi-indriya**, and the tendency to act or know according to the **Labdhi**
in its respective object is **Upayog-bhaavendriya**. Even though there are many
types of **dravya-indriya**, **bhaavendriya**, etc., here we should understand
the question and answer with respect to the **baahya nirvatti** form of
**indriya**. It is with respect to this that the usage of **ekendriya**, etc.,
occurs.  **Bakul**, etc., plants, perceive the objects of all five senses in the
form of **bhaav**, but they are not called **panchendriya** because they do not
have five external senses. Since they have only one external sense in the form
of **sparshan**, they are **ekendriya**. In **sukshma prithvi-kayik jivas**,
there is only one **sparshendriya**.  **9. Samudghat-dvaar:**  Striking the
**karma-dalika** like **vedaniya**, etc., with great force, becoming one with
them, is called **samudghat**. There are seven **samudghat**: 1. **Vedana-
samudghat**, 2. **Kshaya-samudghat**, 3. **Maranan-tik-samudghat**, 4.
**Vaikriya-samudghat**, 5. **Tejas-samudghat**, 6. **Aaharaka-samudghat**, and
7. **Kevali-samudghat**.  **1. Vedana-samudghat:**  **Vedana-samudghat** occurs
due to **asata-vedaniya karma**. Overwhelmed by intense **vedana**, the **jiva**
brings many **vedaniya**, etc., **karma-pudgala**, including those that are
**anubhav-yogya dalika** in the future, to the **udaya-avlika** through
**udaranakaran**, experiences **vedana-bhog**, and then discards them -
separates them from the **atma-pradesha**.  The **jiva** suffering from
**vedana** throws out the **atma-pradesha** enveloped by countless **karma-
pudgala** from the body. From those **pradesha**, it fills the **vadan-jghana**,
etc., openings and the **karna-skandha**, etc., intervals, and expands
throughout the entire body area with **aayam-vistar**, remaining there for an
**antar-muhurt**. During that **antar-muhurt**, many **asata-vedaniya karma-
pudgala** are **parishatan**, **nirjara**. This is **vedana-samudghat**.  **2.
Kshaya-samudghat:** This **samudghat** occurs due to the **kshayo-daya**. The
**jiva** overwhelmed by **kshayo-daya** throws out its own **pradesha**, fills
the **vadan-udara**, etc., openings and intervals with them, and expands
throughout the entire body area with **aayam-vistar**, remaining there. In this
state, the **jiva** performs **parishatan** (**nirjara**) of many **kshaya-
karma-pudgala**. This is **kshaya-samudghat**.  **3. Maranan-tik-samudghat:**
This **samudghat** occurs due to **payu-karma**. In this **samudghat**, the
**bala-jiva** performs **parishatan** of many **prayu-karma dalika** according
to the previous method. This is **maranan-tik-samudghat**.  **4. Vaikriya-
samudghat:** This occurs due to **vaikriya-sharira-namakarma** when the
**vaikriya-sharira** begins. The **jiva** in **vaikriya-samudghat** throws out
its own **pradesha** from the body, and fills the body's 1. **Panchidio u baulo

## First Understanding: Description of the Earth Body [45]  **1. Vaikriya
Samudghat:** This occurs when the earth body expels the gross pudgalas of the
Vaikriya karma, which were bound earlier. This is the Vaikriya Samudghat.  **2.
Tejas Samudghat:** This occurs when the earth body expels the Tejas body karma.
It should be understood in the same way as the Vaikriya Samudghat. This involves
a significant depletion of the Tejas body karma.  **3. Aharaka Samudghat:** This
occurs during the formation of the Aharaka body. It involves the depletion of
many pudgalas of the Aharaka body karma. The process should be understood in the
same way as the Vaikriya body.  **4. Kevali Samudghat:** This occurs before the
final moment of liberation when the Kevali's Ayukarma dalikas are reduced, and
the Vedaniya, Nama, and Gotra karma dalikas remain in specific quantities. This
involves the depletion of many Vedaniya, Nama, and Gotra karma dalikas. It takes
eight stages:  * **Stage 1:** Formation of the Danda * **Stage 2:** Formation of
the Kapata * **Stage 3:** Churning * **Stage 4:** Expansion throughout the
entire universe * **Stage 5:** Absorption of the intermediate realms * **Stage
6:** Absorption of the churning * **Stage 7:** Absorption of the Kapata *
**Stage 8:** Absorption of the Danda, after which the Kevali returns to their
own body.  This process significantly depletes the Vedaniya, Nama, and Gotra
karma dalikas, making them equal to the Ayukarma dalikas. The time for the six
Samudghats (Vedanadi) is Antarmuhurt, and the time for the Kevali Samudghat is
Path time only.  **5. Subtle Earth Body Beings:** Among the subtle earth body
beings, only three of the seven Samudghats occur: Vedana, Kashaya, and
Maranantik. The remaining four Samudghats do not occur because they lack
Vaikriya, Tejas, Aharaka, and Kevali Labdhi.  **6. Sanjidwar:** A being with
consciousness is called a Sanji. Here, consciousness refers to the ability to
recollect the past, present, and future. Beings with specific memory and other
mental faculties are Sanji. Beings lacking these faculties are Asanji.  **7.
Types of Consciousness:** Consciousness is said to be of three types:  *
**Dirghkaliki Sanjna:** This is the consciousness that allows for the
recollection of the past, contemplation of the future, and the present activity
of attraction and repulsion. This consciousness is found in Devas, Narakas,
Garbha, Tiryanch, and Manushyas. * **Hetuvadopaदेशिकी Sanjna:** This is the
consciousness that allows for the present-moment thinking that is useful for
attracting what is beneficial and repelling what is harmful for the sustenance
of the body. This consciousness is found in beings with two or more indriyas,
but not in beings with only one indriya. * **Dristivadopaदेशिकी Sanjna:** Here,
Dristi refers to Samyagdarshan. Beings with Samyaktva, such as those with
Kshayopaशमिक, are Sanji. Those with Mithyatva are Asanji.

The behavior of *sanjni* and *asanjni* should be understood in relation to the
long-term *sanjna* from the three types of *sanjna* mentioned in the
*jivajivaabhigamsutra*. A question may arise: even in one-sensed beings, ten
types of *sanjna* are mentioned in the scriptures, why should they not be
considered *sanjni*? The solution is given that although these ten types of
*sanjna* are present in one-sensed beings, they are insignificant in quantity
and are caused by delusion, therefore they are not considered *sanjni*. For
example, a person with two or four pennies is not called wealthy. Similarly, a
disfigured person is not called beautiful even if he has beauty. The same should
be understood here. Subtle earth-bodied beings do not have long-term *sanjna*,
therefore they are not *sanjni*.   *Asanjni* 11. *Beddwar* - The desire of a
woman for a man, of a man for a woman, and of a eunuch for both is *ved*. There
are three *veds*: 1. *Striveed*, 2. *Purushved*, and 3. *Napunsakaved*. Subtle
earth-bodied beings have *Napunsakaved*. They have *sammucchim* birth. Hellish
beings and *sammucchim* beings are *Napunsakavedi*. 12. *Paryaptidwar* - The
discussion of *paryapti* and *aparyapti* has been done in the commentary of
Sutra number 12. Subtle earth-bodied beings have four *paryaptis*: food, body,
senses, and breath, and these four are also *aparyaptis*. These four
*aparyaptis* should be understood in relation to the cause. From the perspective
of attainment, only one *pranapan* *aparyapti* should be understood. Because
even *labdhi* *aparyaptak* fulfill the *paryapti* of food, body, and senses
according to the rules. No being dies without binding the lifespan of the next
birth, and the lifespan of the next birth is bound only when the three
*paryaptis* are fulfilled. 13. *Dristidwar* - *Dristi* means the understanding
(acceptance) of the truth as taught by the Jinas. There are three types of
*dristi*: 1. *Samyagdristi*, 2. *Mithyadristi*, and 3. *Samyagmithya* (mixed)
*dristi*. The correct understanding of the truth as taught by the Jinas is
*Samyagdristi*. The opposite understanding of the truth as taught by the Jinas
is *Mithyadristi*. For example, a person who has eaten datura sees white objects
as yellow. Similarly, a person who considers the truth taught by the Jinas to be
false and who is averse to it is *Mithyadristi*. A *dristi* that is neither
*samyag* nor *mithya* is mixed *dristi*. Subtle earth-bodied beings have
*Mithyadristi* out of the three *dristi*. They do not have *Samyagdristi*. They
also do not have *sasvadanasamyaktva*. Even those who have *sasvadanasamyaktva*
are 1. *Naraksammucchima Napunsaka* - this is the word of the Lord.

## First Understanding: Description of Earth-bodied Beings [47]  Earth-bodied
beings are not born. Due to their always being in a state of extreme
contraction, they do not possess mixed vision. Nor is a being with mixed vision
born among them, because mixed vision does not have any time.   14. **The Door
of Perception:** The understanding that grasps the common characteristic of a
general-specific object is called perception. It is of four types: 1. Visual
perception, 2. Non-visual perception, 3. Clairvoyance, and 4. Omniscience.
Visual perception is the perception of the general form of a general-specific
object through the eyes. Non-visual perception is the knowledge of the common
characteristic through the remaining senses and mind, excluding the eyes.
Clairvoyance is the knowledge of the general form without the help of senses and
mind. Omniscience is the knowledge of the common characteristics of all
substances in the universe.   Among these four perceptions, subtle earth-bodied
beings possess only non-visual perception. They have a greater tendency towards
tactile perception, but no other perception exists in them.  15. **The Door of
Knowledge:** While knowing the true nature of an object is called knowledge, the
scriptures consider only that knowledge to be true knowledge which is
accompanied by right faith. Knowledge without right faith is called ignorance.
Right faith leads to knowledge in the form of faith-knowledge, scriptural
knowledge, and clairvoyance. However, wrong faith leads to ignorance in the form
of faith-ignorance, scriptural ignorance, and fragmented knowledge.   Subtle
earth-bodied beings have wrong faith, therefore, they are not considered to
possess knowledge. They are definitely considered to have faith-ignorance and
scriptural ignorance.   This faith-ignorance and scriptural ignorance are also
extremely minimal compared to other beings like the Badar.  16. **The Door of
Action:** The activities (tendencies) of mind, speech, and body are called
action. These actions are of three types: mind-action, speech-action, and body-
action.   Out of these three actions, subtle earth-bodied beings possess only
body-action. They do not have speech or mind.  17. **The Door of Utilization:**
The tendency of the soul in the form of understanding is called utilization.
Utilization is of two types: concrete utilization and abstract utilization.  1.
"He does not desire to do anything at any time." (This is a quote from the
scriptures) 2. "This is the most inferior utilization of the soul, as seen by
the wise." 3. "This is the utilization of those who are extremely subtle and
small, and it should be known."  From this point onwards, the knowledge of the
beings is expanded by the Jina, and the cause of their attainment is the body,
senses, speech, and mind.

[48] [Jiva-jiva-abhigamsutra] The result of accepting the specific dharma
(particular dharma) of any object is called sakar-upayoga. It is said, "Pagaro u
viseso". Therefore, the eight types of upayoga, which are five jnana and three
prajnana, are sakar-upayoga. The result of accepting the general dharma of an
object is called anakar-upayoga. The four types of upayoga, which are four
darshan, are anakar-upayoga. It is said that there are twelve types of upayoga
in total, eight sakar-upayoga and four anakar-upayoga. These subtle earth-bodied
beings, having mati-ajnana and shruta-prajnana, are more inclined towards sakar-
upayoga than anakar-upayoga. They are more inclined towards anakar-upayoga than
acchushurdarshan upayoga. 18. Aharadwar - Ahar means to accept external pudgals.
Subtle earth-bodied beings consume the infinite-region skandha from dravya. The
countable-region and uncountable-region skandha are not consumable by the being.
They consume the skandha that resides in the uncountable regions of the field.
They consume the pudgal-skandha that is in any state from the perspective of
time. They consume the skandha that is in any state, whether it is in the lowest
state, the middle state, or the highest state. From the perspective of bhava,
they consume pudgals that have color, smell, taste, and touch. Because every
atom has one color, one smell, one taste, and two touches. From the perspective
of color, they consume pudgals that have one color, two colors, three colors,
four colors, and five colors, considering the common concern (sthanamaargana).
And from the perspective of differentiation (bhedamargana), they consume pudgals
that are black, blue, red, yellow, and white. This statement should be
understood from the perspective of vyavaharanaya. From the perspective of
vyavahar, there is one color, two colors, etc. Otherwise, from the perspective
of nischyanaya, all five colors are found in the smallest infinite-region
skandha. There is also a difference in the specific color like Krishna, etc.
Therefore, the question was asked, "What kind of black-colored pudgals do the
subtle earth-bodied beings consume? Are they one-quality black, ten-quality
black, countable-quality black, uncountable-quality black, or infinite-quality
black?" The answer is that they consume pudgal-skandha that is one-quality black
to infinite-quality black. Similarly, one should understand the same for two
smells and five tastes. From the perspective of touch, they do not consume
pudgals that have one touch, two touches, or three touches, but they consume
pudgals that have four touches, five touches, up to eight touches. From the
perspective of differentiation (bhedamargana), they consume the rough to the
coarse. They consume one-quality rough to infinite-quality rough in the rough,
etc., touches. Similarly, one should understand the same for all eight touches.

## First Understanding: Description of Earth-bodied Beings  Those subtle earth-
bodied beings who consume **pudgalaskandhas** with color, smell, taste, and
touch are in contact with their **atma-pradeshas**. They do not consume
**pudgalaskandhas** that are not in contact. They only consume those
**pudgalaskandhas** that are deeply embedded in their **atma-pradeshas**, not
those that are not deeply embedded. Touch can extend beyond the area of deep
embedding, while deep embedding occurs within the same area. Therefore,
different questions and answers have been given.  There are two types of deeply
embedded **pudgalaskandhas**: **ananta-avagadh** and **parampara-avagadh**.
Those that are uninterruptedly present in their **atma-pradeshas** are **ananta-
avagadh**, and those that are present with the interruption of one, two, three,
etc. **pradeshas** are **parampara-avagadh**. Subtle earth-bodied beings consume
**ananta-avagadh pudgalas**, not **parampara-avagadh**. These **ananta-avagadh
pudgalas** are both **anu-rupa** (with few **pradeshas**) and **bahya-rupa**
(with many **pradeshas**).  These subtle earth-bodied beings consume both types
of **pudgalas**. The earth-bodied being consumes the **pradeshas** located above
or sideways within the area where it is deeply embedded. In the **antar-
muhurta** time period in which the being consumes consumable substances, it
consumes them at the beginning, middle, and end of that **antar-muhurta** time
period. These subtle earth-bodied beings consume **pudgalaskandhas** that are
suitable for their nourishment, not those that are unsuitable.  These subtle
earth-bodied beings consume **pudgalas** that are in accordance with their
**svavishaya** (own nature), not those that are not in accordance. This means
they consume **pudgalas** that are close by, not those that are distant. These
subtle earth-bodied beings consume the **pudgalas** that are close to them from
all six directions if there is no obstruction. If there is an obstruction, they
consume **pudgalas** from three, four, or five directions.  Obstruction means
slipping from the **alokakasha** (non-luminous space). This is explained as
follows: When a subtle earth-bodied being is located in the **lok-nishkuta**
(the last edge) in the **praag-neya** corner of the lower **pratar**, there is a
lack of **pudgalas** in the downward direction due to the absence of **alok**
below. Being located in the **agney-kona** (south-east corner), there is an
influence of **pudgalas** from the east and south directions. In this way, the
downward, east, and south directions are filled with **alok**, so there is a
lack of **pudgalas** in these directions. Therefore, it is only possible to
consume **pudgalas** from the remaining three directions.  Therefore, it is said
that these subtle earth-bodied beings consume **pudgalas** from three directions
due to obstruction. When the same being is present in the west direction, its
east direction becomes more prominent. The south and downward directions are
filled with **alok**, so the being consumes **pudgalas** from four directions:
upward, east, west, and north.

## 50] [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra] When the Jiva is in the western direction of the
second and subsequent Pratyagata, its downward directions also increase. Only
the southern direction, which is one-sided, remains obstructed from the light.
In such a situation, the Jiva receives the Pudgalas situated in the five
directions, including the aforementioned four and the downward directions.
_Concluding the Aharadwar, the Sutrakar has said that these subtle Prithvikaayik
Jivas often receive Pudgalas of all five categories, both fragrant, five-
flavored, and eight-touching, and transform their previous color, taste, smell,
and touch qualities, creating new color, smell, taste, and touch qualities, and
receive the Pudgalas firmly established in their body-field as food from their
Atma-Pradeshas._ 19. Upapatadwar - The place from where one receives birth is
Upapat. These subtle Prithvikaayik Jivas are not born from Narakas, nor are they
born from Devas. Such is the nature of Bhava that Devas and Narakas are not born
as subtle Prithvikaayas. These Jivas are born from all the remaining sufficient
and insufficient Tiryanchas, except for the Tiryanchas with an immeasurable
lifespan. Tiryanchas with an immeasurable lifespan are not born among them. They
can be born from all the remaining sufficient and insufficient humans, except
for the humans born in the Karmabhoomi, the Antaradvipas, and those with an
immeasurable lifespan in the Karmabhoomi. 20. Sthitidwar - Sthiti refers to the
lifespan of that birth. The Sthiti of a subtle Prithvikaayik Jiva is from the
least to the most, only an Antarmuhurta. But one should understand that the
excellent Antarmuhurta is more than the least Antarmuhurta. 21. Samavahata-
Asamavahata Dwar - The death that occurs after the Maranantakasamudghata is
Samavahata, and the death that occurs without the Maranantakasamudghata is
Asamavahata. Both types of death occur in subtle Prithvikaayik Jivas. 22.
Chyavanadwar - The end of that Bhava upon the completion of the present Bhava is
Chyavan. Subtle Prithvikaayik Jivas, upon death, are not born in Narakas nor in
Devas. They are born in Tiryanchas and humans. If they are born in Tiryanchas,
they can be born in all the remaining one-sensory to five-sensory sufficient and
insufficient Tiryanchas, except for the Tiryanchas of the Bhogbhoomi with an
immeasurable lifespan. If they are born in humans, they are born in all the
remaining sufficient or insufficient humans, except for the Akarmabhoomij,
Antaradvipaj, and humans with an immeasurable lifespan. This statement also
proves that the Atma is not omnipresent and that it is born in Bhavantera. 23.
Gati-Agati Dwar - The place where the Jiva goes after death is its Gati, and the
place from where the Jiva receives birth is its Agati. Subtle Prithvikaayik
Jivas have two Gatis and two Pragatis. These subtle Prithvikaayik Jivas, upon
death, are born in Tiryancha and human Gatis, not in Narakas and Devas.
Therefore, Tiryanchagati and Manushya Gati are their two Gatis.

## First Understanding: Description of Earth-bodied Beings  [51] These subtle
earth-bodied beings are not born from gods or hell beings. They are only born
from animals and humans, therefore these beings are of two origins. /  These
subtle earth-bodied beings are all-bodied, countless in number, as vast as the
space of the universe. This is how all the Tirthankaras have declared it.
Samanauso - O Shraman! O Ayushman! Addressing the inquisitive disciples in this
way, Lord Mahavira explained the nature of subtle earth-bodied beings.   What
are the subtle earth-bodied beings? Subtle earth-bodied beings are of two types
- as follows: smooth (soft) subtle earth-bodied beings and rough subtle earth-
bodied beings.   [14] What are the smooth subtle earth-bodied beings? Smooth
subtle earth-bodied beings are of seven types - as follows: those who are born
in the womb, those who are born from eggs, those who are born from moisture,
those who are born from heat, those who are born from decay, those who are born
from seeds, and those who are born from the union of two.   [15] What are the
rough subtle earth-bodied beings? Rough subtle earth-bodied beings are of two
types - as follows: those who are born from the womb and those who are not born
from the womb.   Bante! How many types of bodies do beings have? Gotama! There
are three types of bodies - as follows: those who have a body made of earth,
those who have a body made of water, and those who have a body made of karma.
And also, there are four types of bodies, the remaining ones, like the subtle
earth-bodied beings, from the food they eat to the six types of rules.   The
attention of the animal, human, god, and god-like beings, from the god-like
beings to the Sohammesha, is fixed on the world. In this way, the lifespan of
the beings is thousands of years, with the help of the great food.   Bante! Do
beings die with awareness or without awareness? Gotama! They die with awareness
and also without awareness.   Bante! Where do beings go after they die? Where
are they reborn? Are they reborn in hell? Ask. They are not reborn in hell, they
are reborn in the animal realm, they are reborn as humans, they are not reborn
as gods, and also, they are reborn in countless worlds.   Bante! How many types
of destinies and origins do beings have? Gotama! Two destinies, three origins,
and countless others, Samanauso! This is the subtle earth-bodied being.   This
is the earth-bodied being.

## 52] [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra [15] What are the smooth (soft) Bādar Earth-
bodied beings? The smooth Bādar Earth-bodied beings are said to be of seven
types - black soil, etc., according to the knowledge of the differentiation
sutra. However, they are said to be of two types in brief - sufficient and
insufficient. / O Bhagavan! How many bodies are said to be of these beings?
Gautama! Three bodies are said to be, such as, Praudārika, Tejas and Kārmaṇ. /
In this way, all the statements should be known as before. / The special feature
is that they have four Leshyās. The rest of the statement should be known like
the subtle Earth-bodied beings, as they take food from all six directions
according to the rule. / These Bādar Earth-bodied beings are born from the
Tiryanch, human and Devas. If they come from the Devas, they come from the
Saudharma and Ishan (first and second) Devalokas. Their duration is from the
lowest Antarmūhurta to the highest twenty-two thousand years. O Bhagavan! Do
these beings die with Samavaha or without Samavaha? Gautama! They die with
Samavaha and also without Samavaha. Bhagavan! Where do these beings go after
death from there? Where are they born? Should questions like, are they born in
Narakas, be asked? Gautama! They are not born in Narakas, they are born in
Tiryanch, they are born in humans, they are not born in Devas. They are not born
in Tiryanch and humans who have an immeasurable lifespan, etc. / / Bhagavan! How
many speeds and how many speeds are said to be of those beings? Gautama! They
are said to be of one speed and three speeds. O Ayushman Shraman! Those Bādar
Earth-bodied beings are each-bodied and are immeasurable Lokākāsha in measure.
Thus, the description of the Bādar Earth-bodied beings is complete. With this,
the description of the Earth-bodied beings is complete. / Discussion - The
Earth-bodied beings whose body is Bādar in the form of a Hosamūha, which is
perceptible to the eye, are the Bādar Earth-bodied beings. There are two types
of Bādar Earth-bodied beings - smooth Bādar Earth-bodied and rough Bādar Earth-
bodied. / The soil which is soft like ground flour is smooth Earth, and the
beings which are similar to it are also called smooth Bādar Earth-bodied by
treatment. The Earth with roughness is rough Bādar Earth. The beings similar to
it are called rough Bādar Earth-bodied by treatment. Smooth Bādar Earth-bodied -
There are seven types of smooth Bādar Earth-bodied - black soil, etc., according
to the knowledge of differentiation. The Sutrakar has given information about
knowing the meaning of that text of differentiation. The meaning of that text of
differentiation is as follows...

soil, 3. Red soil, 4. Yellow soil, 5. White soil, 6. Pandu soil, and 7. Panka
soil - these seven types of soils are Shlakshna Badar Earth. / The beings
residing in them are A-Shlakshna Badar Earth-bodied beings. / The first five
distinctions are clear from the difference in color. Pandu soil is that which is
known as Pandu in a particular region, being in the form of soil. The
commentator has interpreted Panka-Mrittika as follows - the soft mud that
remains in the land after the filling up of rivers etc. and its receding, which
is also called 'Jalmal', is Panka-Mrittika. The beings residing in it are also
called Panka-Mrittika Shlakshna Badar Earth-bodied by convention.  Khar-Badar
Earth-bodied: Khar-Badar Earth-bodied have been said to be of many types.
Mainly, forty types have been mentioned in four stanzas. They are as follows: 1.
Pure Earth - riverbank, wall, 2. Sugar, small pebbles etc., 3. Baluka - sand, 4.
Upala - tank etc. equipment sharpening stone (for increasing the size), 5. Shila
- large stone suitable for grinding, 6. Lavana - salt etc., 7. Us - alkaline
soil which makes the land barren, 8. Iron, 9. Copper, 10. Ranga, 11. Sosa, 12.

Khar-Badar Earth-bodied in this way, by saying 'Je Yavanne Thappagaara', other
types like Padmaraga etc. have also been indicated. / These Badar Earth-bodied
have been said to be of two types in brief: sufficient and insufficient. / The
beings who have not fulfilled their own sufficient qualities, their color etc.
characteristics are not clear, therefore, they cannot be described by black etc.
specific colors. Color etc. appear in Badar beings only when the body etc.
sufficient qualities are fulfilled. These insufficient beings die before
fulfilling the sufficient quality of exhalation, therefore, the specific color
etc. of these insufficient beings cannot be mentioned. / In general, color etc.
appear as soon as the body sufficient quality is fulfilled. Therefore, it has
been said that insufficient beings do not have specific color etc. / General

## Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra: On the Gross Earth-Bodies  In these gross earth-
bodies, which are substantial living beings, there are thousands of varieties
due to differences in color, smell, taste, and touch. For example, there are 5
colors, 2 smells, 5 tastes, and 8 touches.    Even within a single color, like
black, there are many subtle variations due to its intensity. Coal and soot are
both black, but their blackness differs in intensity. Similarly, one should
understand the variations within other colors like blue.   The same principle
applies to smell, taste, and touch.  Furthermore, combinations of these
categories create even more variations, like gray and brown. Similarly,
combinations of smell, etc., lead to many variations. Therefore, it is said that
there are thousands of variations based on color, etc.  There are a hundred
thousand types of these gross earth-bodies. Each color, smell, taste, and touch
has three types of closed wombs in earth-bodies: sentient, non-sentient, and
mixed.   Each of these has three variations based on cold, hot, and moderate.
Even within cold, etc., there are many variations based on intensity.   Even
though there are countless individuals with a specific color, they are
considered as one womb-caste due to their shared characteristics.  Thus, there
are a hundred thousand types of wombs in earth-bodies.   It is said that there
are seven hundred thousand types of wombs in all earth-bodies, both subtle and
gross. These gross earth-bodies are born in countless numbers under the shelter
of one substantial being. Where there is one substantial being, there are
countless non-substantial beings under its shelter.  The body, organs of
perception, etc., of these gross earth-bodies should be considered similar to
those of the subtle earth-bodies, as explained earlier. Only the specific
characteristics and differences are mentioned here.  One should understand the
specific characteristics of the lower organs:  * **Taking Organ:** In subtle
earth-bodies, three types of leshyas were mentioned. In gross earth-bodies,
there are four leshyas. They also have a tejo-leshya. From the Vyantar Devas to
the Ishana Devaloka, the gods are born in their palaces and vehicles due to
extreme fainting, and they have tejo-leshya. The Agam says, "Jalle se marai,
salle se uvvjai" (One is born in the same leshya in which one dies). Therefore,
for a short time, non-substantial beings also have tejo-leshya. * **Mouth
Organ:** Gross earth-bodies regularly consume food from all six directions.
Since gross beings are born in the middle of the universe, not at the edges,
there is no question of obstruction. * **Receiving Organ:** Gross earth-bodies
can be born from Devas, as well as from other beings. Therefore, they can be
born from animals, humans, and Devas. * **Position:** Their position ranges from
the lowest, lasting only a moment, to the highest, lasting twenty-two thousand
years. * **Movement:** They can also be born from Devas, so they have three
types of progress and two types of movement.

Bhagavan! How many bodies are said to be of these beings? Gautama! They are said
to be of three bodies, namely, the Audarika, the Taijasa, and the Karman. /
Thus, all the doors should be described like the Sukshma Prithvikaayika. / The
special feature is that in the Sansthana door, their Stibuk (bubble form) is
called the Sansthana. / The rest should be described in the same way, as long as
they are of two motions, two arrivals, each-bodied, and countless. / This is the
right of the Sukshma Apkayika.  The Badar Apkayika [17] What are the Badar
Apkayika? The Badar Apkayika are said to be of nine types, namely, the Osa, the

[56] From the Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra, tell me, O Shraman, what are the
characteristics of the Badar Apkayika, which are two-gated, three-gated, and
countless in number, and which are found in the earth-body? [17] What is the
nature of the Badar Apkayika? Badar Apkayika are said to be of many types, such
as Pros, Him, and other similar forms of water. They are briefly of two types:
sufficient and insufficient. / Thus, it should be said as before / The
characteristic is that their institution is Stibuk (bubble). They have four
Leshyas, six directions according to the Pahar rule, from the Tiryanch Yonic,
humans and gods, the position should be known from the lowest to the innermost
moment and the highest seven thousand years / The remaining Badar should be
known like the earth-body, as long as they are two-gated, three-gated, each-
bodied, and countless. / O Ayushman! O Shraman! This is the statement of the
Badar Apkayika. With this, the authority of the Apkayika is complete. Discussion
- After describing the earth-bodied beings, information about the Prakayika
beings has been given in these two sutras. Apkayika beings are said to be of two
types - subtle Apkayika and Badar Apkayika / Subtle Apkayika beings are present
in all the lokas and Badar Apkayika beings are in places like Ghanodadhi etc. In
relation to subtle Apkayika beings, the aforementioned 23 doors should be
understood as the same as the subtle earth-bodied beings / Only the institution
door is different. The institution of subtle earth-bodied beings is described as
being like a lentil-shaped pulse, while the institution of subtle Apkayika
beings is like a bubble. Badar Apkayika beings - Badar Apkayika beings are said
to be of many types, such as Pros, ice, etc. / Their special description should
be known according to the Prajnapan Sutra / That authority is as follows -
'Badar Apkayika beings are said to be of many types, such as Pros, Him (frozen
water-ice) Mahika (subtle rain in the womb-month-Ar) Karak (hail) Haratanu
(water drop remaining on the grass etc. that sprouts by breaking the ground),
Shuddhodak (water falling from the sky or river etc.) Shitoadak (cold well etc.
water) Ushnodak (hot spring water) Ksharodak (salty water) Khattodak (slightly
sour water) Amlodak (more kanji-like sour water) Lavnodak (salt sea water)
Varunodak (Varun sea water with a taste like wine) Kshirodadak (Kshirasamudra
water) Ghritodak (Ghritvarasamudra water) Kshododak (Ikshurasasamudra water) and
Rasodak (Pushkarvarasamudra water) etc., and there are other similar waters.
They should all be understood as Badar Apkayika. They are of two types -
sufficient and insufficient / In these, 1. Pracharanganiyukti and Uttaraadhyayan
Pra. 36 verse 26 only mentions five types of Badar Apkayika: 1. Shuddhodak, 2.
Pros, 3. Him, 4. Mahika Por 5. Haratanu /

## First Understanding: The Subtle Plant-bodied  [57] Those who are insufficient
beings, are not said to have black, etc., specific colors, smells, tastes, and
touches, due to the manifestation of their color, smell, taste, touch, etc., but
generally, due to having a body, they have color, etc., in an unmanifest form. /
Those beings who are sufficient, are of various kinds due to color, smell,
taste, and touch. Due to the difference in color, etc., and their subtlety,
there are thousands of their kinds. In total, they have seven hundred thousand
species. / In the lifespan of one sufficient being, countless insufficient
beings are born. / Where there is one sufficient being, there are countless
insufficient beings by rule.  Regarding the subtle plant-bodied beings, one
should understand the 23 gates in the same way as the subtle earth-bodied
beings. The difference is that the institution of the subtle plant-bodied beings
should be understood as being like a bubble. / In the gate of position, one
should understand the lowest as a moment, and the highest as seven thousand
years. / The rest of the statements should be understood in the same way as the
subtle earth-bodied beings. O Venerable Ascetic! Those subtle plant-bodied
beings are said to be each-bodied and countless in number, as vast as the space
of the universe. This is the description of the subtle plant-bodied beings.  ##
The Plant-bodied  [18] What is the nature of the plant-bodied beings? The plant-
bodied beings are said to be of two kinds, namely: the subtle plant-bodied and
the gross plant-bodied.  [16] What are the subtle plant-bodied beings? The
subtle plant-bodied beings are of two kinds, namely: the sufficient and the
insufficient. The description of these should be understood in the same way as
the subtle earth-bodied beings. The special feature is that the institution of
the subtle plant-bodied beings is impermanent. / These beings are those who go
in two motions and those who obtain in two motions. They are non-each-bodied
(infinite-bodied) and infinite in number. / O Venerable Ascetic! This is the
description of the subtle plant-bodied beings.  [19] What are the gross plant-
bodied beings? The gross plant-bodied beings are of two kinds, namely: the gross
plant-bodied beings with a leaf-like body and the gross plant-bodied beings with
an ordinary body.

## First Understanding: The Plant-bodied (Bādar Vanaspatikāyika)  **[59] Roots,
stems, bark, branches, corals, leaves - each of these is a single-bodied being.
Their flowers are multi-bodied, and their fruits are single-seeded.** This
describes single-seeded trees. What are multi-seeded trees? Multi-seeded trees
are of many types, such as Astika, Tendu, Amber, Kabith, Pravala, Panas, Dadim,
Nyagrodha, Kadumbar, Tilaka, Lakuch (Lavaka), Lodhra, Dhawa, and others of this
kind. Their roots are countless-bodied, and their fruits are multi-seeded. This
describes multi-seeded beings. Along with this, the description of trees is also
given. In this way, as stated in the Prajñāpanā, it should be said here, from
"other types" to "Kuhan".  **Gāthārtha:** The arrangements of trees are of
various kinds. The leaves and stems of Tāla, Sarala, and Nārikeli trees are
single-bodied. Just as a block made of sesame seeds mixed with smooth substances
is uniform, but the seeds within it are separate, so too are the body aggregates
of each being. Just as there are many separate sesame seeds in a sesame cake, so
too are the body aggregates of each being separate, yet they are in the form of
a community. This describes the plant-bodied beings (Bādar Vanaspatikāyika).
**Vivecana:** Those who have the name "Bādar" are called plant-bodied beings
(Bādar Vanaspatikāyika). There are two types of these: each-bodied
(Pratyekasharīrī) and ordinary-bodied (Sādhāraṇasharīrī). Those beings who have
separate bodies are each-bodied, and those beings who have a combined body are
ordinary-bodied. These two threads describe the plant-bodied beings (Bādar
Vanaspatikāyika).  Twelve types of each-bodied plant-bodied beings (Bādar
Pratyekasharīrī Vanaspatikāyika) have been mentioned. They are as follows:  1.
**Vṛkṣa:** Trees like Neem, Mango, etc. 2. **Guccha:** Plant-like beings like
Brinjal, etc. 3. **Mulma:** Flower-bearing plants like Navamalika, etc. 4.
**Latā:** Vines that climb on trees, like Champakalatā, etc. 5. **Valli:** Vines
that spread on the ground, like Kasmāṇḍa, Apūṣī, etc. 6. **Parvag:** Plants with
knots, like Iksu, etc. 7. **Tṛṇa:** Green grasses like Dūba, Kāsa, Kuśa, etc. 8.
**Valaya:** Those with round bark, like Ketaki, Kadali, etc. 9. **Harita:**
Green vegetables like Bathu, etc. 10. **Auṣadhi:** Grains like Wheat, etc.,
which dry up when they ripen. 11. **Jalasah:** Plants that grow in water, like
Lotus, Singhada, etc. 12. **Kuhan:** Plants that grow by breaking the ground,
like Mushrooms (Chatrak), etc.

[60] There are two types of trees according to the *Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra*:
those with one seed and those with many seeds. Trees with one seed per fruit are
called *Ekaasthik* and those with many seeds are called *Bahubijak*. Some of the
names of *Ekaasthik* trees are mentioned in the *Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra*, while
the rest are to be known according to the *Prajnapanasutra*. The names of
*Ekaasthik* trees mentioned in the *Prajnapanasutra* are: Neem, Mango, Jamun,
Kosamb (wild plum), Saal, Ankoll (walnut or pistachio tree), Pilu, Selu
(Lasoda), Sallki (hand-loving), Monkey, Maluk, Bakul (Moulusari), Palash (Dhak),
Karanj (Nakamal); Putrajiva, Arista (Aritha), Vibhitak (Baheda), Harad,
Bhallatak (Bhilawa), Umbebharia, Khirni, Dhatki (Dhavda) and Priyal; Putik
(Nimba), Karanj, Slakshna, Shinsapa, Asan, Punnag (Nagkesar), Nagavriksh,
Shripurni and Ashoka. All these are *Ekaasthik* trees. Similarly, all other
trees that grow in different countries and have only one seed per fruit should
be considered *Ekaasthik* trees.   The roots of these *Ekaasthik* trees contain
countless living beings. Their tubers, stems, bark, branches and buds also
contain countless living beings. However, their leaves contain one living being
each. Their flowers contain many living beings and their fruits contain one
seed.  The names of *Bahubijak* trees are mentioned in the *Pannavanasutra* as
follows: Asthik, Tinduk, Kabith, Ambadg, Matuling (Bijaura), Bilva, Amalak
(Pranvala), Pans (Ananas), Dadim, Ashvasth (Pipal), Udumbar (Gular), Vat (Bad),
Nyagrodh (Big Bad); Nandivriksh, Pippali, Shatari, Plaksh, Kadumbari,
Kastumbhari, Devadali, Tilak, Lavak (Lakucha-Litchi), Chatropka, Shirish,
Saptaparna, Dadhiparna, Lodhra, Dhav, Chandan, Arjan, Nip, Kurj (Kutak) and
Kadamb. Similarly, all other trees that have many seeds per fruit should be
considered *Bahubijak*.  Among the names of trees mentioned above, some are
well-known and some are specific to certain regions. Some names refer to the
same tree but with different varieties. It is important to understand the
different names used in different regions. The name 'Pamalak' (Pranvala) is
found among the *Bahubijak* trees. It should be understood as referring to a
specific type of tree other than the well-known Pranvala, because the well-known
Pranvala has one seed and not many.  The roots of these *Bahubijak* trees
contain countless living beings. Their tubers, stems, bark, branches and buds
also contain countless living beings. Their leaves contain one living being
each. Their flowers contain many living beings and their fruits contain many
seeds.  1. *Prajnapanasutra*, First Chapter, Verses 13-14-15

##  [61 First Understanding: The Nature of Ordinary Plants]  Just like trees,
various types of clusters, shrubs, creepers, vines, climbers, grasses, rings,
greens, herbs, aquatic plants, and tubers are described in detail in the
Prajñāpanā Sūtra.  _Here, the doubt may arise that if the roots, etc., of trees
are inhabited by many individual living beings, then how do they appear as one
body? The Sūtrakara has resolved this doubt with two illustrations:_  **The
Mustard Seed Paste Illustration:** Just as when all the whole mustard seeds are
mixed together with a binding substance, a paste is formed, but the mustard
seeds remain in their own individual states. Although they appear as one due to
being stuck together, they are still individual mustard seeds. Similarly, the
body aggregates of individual living beings also remain in their own individual
states, but due to being mixed together by a specific karma-like binding
substance, they appear as one body.  **The Sesame Seed Cake Illustration:** Just
as in a sesame seed cake, each sesame seed is separate in its own state, but the
cake is one. Similarly, individual living beings, while being in their own
individual states, appear as one body. This is the description of the individual
living being plant.  **The Nature of Ordinary Plants:** 21. How are ordinary
body plants? _Ordinary body plants are of many types, such as - potato, root,
ginger, hiralī, sirīlī, sisīrilī, kittikā, kṣīrikā, kṣīraviḍālikā, kṛṣṇakanda,
vajrakanda, sūrana..._  ...and so on. These are broadly classified into two
types, namely, those that are born and those that are not born.  **_Question:_**
Venerable Sir! How many bodies do living beings have?  **_Answer:_**  There are
three bodies, namely, the oral body, the mental body, and the karmic body.
**_Explanation:_**  Just as in the case of external earth elements, the body's
range of perception is immeasurable, extending for countless yojanas in all
directions. Bodies are impermanent and constantly changing, lasting for
thousands of years at most. They are subject to the three destinies: the lower
realms, the middle realms, and the higher realms. This is the nature of external
plants, this is the nature of stationary beings. [21]

[62] One should know the following types of ordinary plant-bodied beings:  Jīvā-
jīvābhigama-sūtra, Kanda, Khalluṭa, Kṛmirāśi, Bhadra, Mustāpiṇḍa, Haridrā,
Lohārī, Snihu, Stibhu, Aśvakarṇī, Siṃhakarṇī, Sikunḍī, Muṣaṇḍī, and others like
these. These have been said to be of two types in brief, namely: sufficient and
insufficient. /  O Bhagavan! How many bodies have been said to be of these
beings?  Gautama! Three bodies have been said to be: Audārika, Tejas, and
Kārmaṇa. /  One should know all these statements like the Bādar earth-bodied
beings. The special feature is that the perception of their bodies is from the
smallest part of an inch to the largest part of a thousand yojanas and a little
more. Their body structures are indefinite, and their duration is from the
smallest part of a moment to the largest part of ten thousand years. They move
in two directions and come in three directions. Each plant being is innumerable,
and the ordinary plant beings are said to be infinite. This is the description
of the Bādar plant, and with this, the description of the stationary beings is
complete. /  Discussion: In a single body, infinite ordinary plant-bodied beings
reside, are born together, their bodies are formed together, they take in the
pudgalas of prāṇa and apāna together, and they breathe together. The food,
breathing, etc., of the ordinary beings residing in one body happens together. /
The taking in of food, etc., by one being is the taking in of food, etc., by all
beings, and the taking in of food, etc., by all is the taking in of food, etc.,
by one being. This is the characteristic of the ordinariness of ordinary beings.
/  Just as a red-hot iron ball in fire becomes entirely red and fiery, so one
should know the transformation of infinite beings in a single body in the form
of a Nigoda. The body of one, two, or innumerable Nigoda beings is not visible.
Only the bodies of infinite Nigodas can be seen. In this matter, the words of
the Tīrthankara Deva are the proof. The Bhagavan says that there are innumerable
spheres in a Nigoda body the size of the point of a needle, innumerable Nigodas
in each sphere, and infinite beings in each Nigoda. /  In the present sūtra,
many types of ordinary plant-bodied beings have been described. By mentioning
the names of some ordinary plants, the Prajñāpanasūtra has been referred to for
specific information. There is a detailed explanation of this in that sūtra. /
The characteristics of the Bādar plant and the ordinary plant, as mentioned in
the Prajñāpanasūtra, are mentioned here because they are relevant and useful.

## First Understanding: The Nature of Ordinary Plants  **Identifying Ordinary
Plants:**  1. A plant is considered ordinary if its root, tuber, stem, bark,
branch, twig, flower, fruit, seed, etc., when broken, breaks evenly, in a
circular manner, without any unevenness or twisting. 2. A plant is considered to
have infinite lives if its bark is thicker than the wood (central core) of its
root, tuber, stem, and branches. 3. A plant is considered ordinary if the broken
surface of its root, tuber, stem, bark, branch, leaf, flower, etc., is circular
and even. 4. A plant is considered ordinary if its knots or joints, when broken,
produce powder. 5. A plant is considered to have infinite bodies if it has the
same kind of cracks as the earth. 6. A plant with or without milk, whose veins
are not visible, or whose joints are completely invisible, is also considered to
have infinite lives. Flowers should be understood according to the instructions
of the scriptures. Some have a countable number of lives, some have an
uncountable number of lives, and some have infinite lives.  **Characteristics of
Every-bodied Plants:**  1. A plant is considered every-bodied if its root,
tuber, stem, bark, branch, twig, leaf, flower, fruit, and seed, when broken,
show a "heer" (a specific type of unevenness) - meaning the break is not even
but uneven and jagged. 2. A plant is considered every-bodied if its broken
surface is not circular but uneven. 3. A plant is considered every-bodied if its
bark is thinner than the wood (central core) of its root, tuber, stem, and
branches.  All plants that do not possess the characteristics of ordinary plants
mentioned above should be considered every-bodied plants.  Every bud (kislay) is
infinite-bodied when it emerges, whether it is every-bodied or ordinary.
However, as the bud grows and develops into a leaf, it becomes every-bodied from
ordinary.  These plant-bodied beings are of two types: sufficient and
insufficient. Those that are insufficient do not have their colors and other
characteristics clearly defined. Those that are sufficient have thousands of
varieties based on their color, smell, taste, and touch.  There are a million
species of these plant-bodied beings. Every plant-bodied being has 10 lakh (1
million) species, and ordinary plants have 14 lakh (1.4 million) species.
Insufficient beings are born from the shelter of sufficient beings. Where there
is one sufficient being, there may be a countable number, an uncountable number,
or an infinite number of insufficient beings.  One should understand that there
are a countable number, an uncountable number, and an infinite number of
insufficient beings compared to every plant, and an infinite number of
insufficient beings compared to ordinary plants.  1. "Uggemana Ananta" (Infinite
in origin).

The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra, in its examination of the 23 gates concerning the
Badar Vanaspatikayas, states that all statements should be understood as being
similar to the Badar Prithvikayikas. The difference lies in the fact that the
organization of these Badar Vanaspatikaya beings is diverse and impermanent. Its
excellent penetration is said to be more than a thousand yojanas. It should be
understood in comparison to creepers, etc., in external islands, and in
comparison to lotus stalks in the ocean and pilgrimage sites.  It is the opinion
of the elder teachers that the penetration of lotuses should be understood as
the result of the Prithvikayas. In the Sthitidwar, it should be said that the
excellent duration is ten thousand years. After the Gati-Pragati Dwar, the text
is "Aparitta Ananta". This means that each embodied plant being is innumerable,
and the ordinary embodied plant beings are infinite. Thus, O Ayushman Shraman!
This is the statement of the Badar Vanaspati, and with this, the statement of
the stationary beings is complete.  What is the nature of the Trasas? Trasas are
said to be of three types, namely Tejas-kay, Vayu-kay, and Udara-Tras. What is
Tejas-kay? Tejas-kay is said to be of two types, namely Suhum-Tejas-kay and
Badar-Tejas-kay. What is Suhum-Tejas-kay? Suhum-Tejas-kay should be understood
like the Suhum-Prithvikayikas. The special feature is that the organization of
their bodies should be understood as being the size of a community of needles.
These beings go only in one motion (Tiyancha-gati) and come from two motions
(Tiyancha and humans).

## First Understanding: The Statement of the Badar Tejaskaayikas [65]  These
beings are each with a body and are countless. This is the statement of the
subtle Tejaskaayikas.   **25. What is the nature of the Badar Tejaskaayikas?**
The Badar Tejaskaayikas are said to be of many types, such as the fire of coal,
the fire of flame, the fire of Murmur (Bhubhur), and the fire that emanates from
the Suryakant gem, and other similar fires. These Badar Tejaskaayikas are, in
summary, of two types: sufficient and insufficient.  **O Bhagavan! How many
bodies are said to be possessed by these beings?**  **Gautam!** They are said to
have three bodies: 1. Audarik, 2. Taijas, and 3. Karman.  The remaining Badar
should be understood like the Prithvikaayikas. The difference is that their
bodies are the size of a community of needles, they have three Leshyas, the
lowest state is Antarmuhurt, and the highest is three nights and days. They come
from the Tiryanch and humans, and only go to the Tiryanchgaati. They are each
with a body and are said to be countless. This is the description of the
Tejaskaayikas.  **Discussion:**  In this sutra, the Trasajeevas are said to be
of three types: Tejaskaayikas, Vayukaayikas, and Udara As. Previously, it was
stated that the Basajeevas are of two types: Gatitras and Labdhitras. The
Tejaskaayikas and Vayukaayikas, who are called Tras here, should be understood
in relation to Gatitras. In Tejaskaay and Vayukaay, there is unintentional
movement, not intentional movement. Those who can move intentionally are clearly
called Udara Tras, such as the Dwindriyadi Trasajeevas. These are called
Labdhitras. Tejas means fire. Those beings whose body is fire are called
Tejaskaayikas. These Tejaskaayikas are said to be of two types: Sakshma
Tejaskaayikas and Badar Tejaskaayikas. The subtle Tejaskaayikas are those who
have the उदय of the subtle karma and are present in all the lokas, and who...

[66] The statement "killing a Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra does not result in death"
should be understood like the subtle Earth-bodied beings. All statements in the
consideration of the 23 doors should be understood like the subtle Earth-bodied
beings. Especially, the body-structure of the subtle Tejas-bodied beings is like
the community of Saiyas. In the Chyavan door, these subtle Tejas-bodied beings
emerge from there and are born only in the Tiryanch-Gati, not in the Manushya-
Gati. The Agam says, "The Nairyik, Tejas-kayik and Vayu-kayik of the seventh
Earth, who have an infinite lifespan of countless years, do not die and go to
the Manushya-Gati." In the Gati-Pragati door, the Tejas-kayik go only to the
Tiryanch-Gati, and the Tiryanch-Gati comes from the Manushya-Gati and is born in
them. Therefore, they are of one Gati and two Pragati. The Badar Tejas-kayik-
Badar Tejas-kayik beings are those who have the Badar-karma arising. They have
many types, such as Ingal, Jwala, Murmur, Yavat Suryakantmani Nisrit. The word
Yavat should be understood to include Achi, Alat, Shuddhagni, Ulka, Vidyut,
Ashani, Nirghat, Sangharsh-Samutthit. Ingal means fire like Khaira, etc., which
is luminous without smoke. Jwala means flames or lamp-flames associated with
fire. Murmur means fire particles mixed with ashes - Bhobhara. Achi means a
flame not connected to the original fire. Alat means the round circle that
appears when fire is applied to a piece of wood and rotated around, that is
Ulmulk or Alat. Shuddhagni is the fire that enters into a lump of iron, etc.
Ulka - a streak of light, a spark, moving from one direction to another. Vidyut
- lightning that flashes in the sky. Ashani - fiery particles falling from the
sky. Nirghat - thunderbolt or lightning strike related to Vaikriya. Sangharsh-
Samutthit - fire produced by rubbing of Aranikashth or other rubbing.
Suryakantmani-Nisrit - fire emanating from the Suryakantmani due to the touch of
intense rays of the sun. There are also other such fires that are Badar Tejas-
kayik. These Badar Tejas-kayik are of two types - sufficient and insufficient.
The color, etc., of insufficient beings are not clearly manifested. The
sufficient beings have thousands of types and countless Yonis in relation to
color, smell, taste and touch. They have seven lakh Yonis. In the Nisra of one
sufficient, countless insufficient beings are born. The consideration of the
body, etc., 23 doors should be understood like the subtle Tejas-kayik.
Especially, their state is from the lowest to the Antarmuhurt and from the
highest to three nights and days. Food should be understood like the Badar
Prithvi-kayik. 1. Sattami Mahineraiya Teu Vau Pranataruvvadra. Navi Pave

## First Understanding: The Air Body  **What is the Air Body?** The Air Body is
said to be of two types: **Subtle Air Body** and **Dense Air Body**.  **What is
the Subtle Air Body?** The Subtle Air Body should be understood like the Light
Body. It is characterized by its flag-like shape. These bodies move in one
direction and come from two directions. They are each-bodied and countless in
number, extending across the entire universe.  **What is the Dense Air Body?**
The Dense Air Body is said to be of many types, such as the Eastern Wind, the
Western Wind, and other similar Air Bodies. In summary, they are of two types:
**Sufficient** and **Insufficient**.  **Lord! How many bodies are there for the
living beings?** **Gautama!** There are four bodies: **Audaric**, **Vaikriya**,
**Tejas**, and **Karman**.  **Their bodies are flag-shaped.** They have four
accumulations: **Pain Accumulation**, **Passion Accumulation**, **Fatal
Accumulation**, and **Vaikriya Accumulation**.  **Food is taken in six
directions, eight directions, ten directions, twelve directions, and fifteen
directions.**  **There is no dwelling place for the gods, humans, and the
inhabitants of the lower realms.**  **They remain in the womb for three thousand
years, and then they are born in one direction, two directions, many directions,
and countless directions.**  **This is the Dense Air Body, and this is the Air
Body.**

## 68] [The Sutra of the Approach of Souls and the Sutra of the Liberation of
Souls / If there is no obstruction or hindrance, the reception of the six
directions of pudgalas takes place, and if there is obstruction or hindrance,
then sometimes the reception of the pudgalas of three directions, sometimes four
directions, and sometimes five directions takes place / These souls are not born
in the Deva-Gati, Manushya-Gati, and Naraka-Gati. Their duration is from the
most inferior to an instant and from the most superior to three thousand years.
The rest is as before / O Venerable Shraman! They have been called as having one
motion, two motions, each having a body, and innumerable. This is the statement
of the dense air-body and the air-body. The discussion is that the souls whose
body is air are called air-bodied / These are of two types: subtle and dense /
The subtle air-bodied should be known like the subtle luminous-bodied described
earlier / The difference is that the body of the air-bodied is in the shape of a
flag (Dhwaja). The dense air-bodied souls have been said to be of many types.
The types mentioned in the Prajnapanasutra should be mentioned here / There,
their types are described as follows: Purvavat - the wind coming from the east
direction / Paschimavat - the wind coming from the west direction / Dakshinavat
- the wind coming from the south direction / Udicinavat - the wind coming from
the north direction. Urdhvaavat - the wind blowing in the upward direction /
Adhoavat - the wind blowing in the downward direction / Tiryaagvat - the wind
blowing in the diagonal direction / Vidishavat - the wind coming from the
Vidishas / Vato-bhram - the wind blowing in irregular directions / Vato-tkarika
- the stormy wind blowing as fast as the sea / Vat-mandalika - the circular
wind, the whirlwind / Utkalika-vat - the wind mixed with strong gusts /
Mandalika-vat - the wind starting from circular winds and mixed with strong
gusts / Gunjavat - the roaring wind. Jhanjavat - the storm or the inauspicious
and harsh wind that blows with rain / Samvartak-vat - the wind that carries away
straws, etc., or the wind that blows during the time of destruction / Dhanavat -

## First Understanding: Description of Audarik Trasas  There are thousands of
types of Audarik Trasas. They have seven hundred thousand Yonis. In the shelter
of a sufficient Vayukaya being, countless insufficient Vayukaya beings are born
according to the rules. In the consideration of the 23 doors, including the
body, these Badar Vayukaya beings have four bodies: Audarik, Vaikriya, Tejas,
and Karman. There are four types of Samudhat: Vaikriya Samudhat, Vedana
Samudhat, Kashaya Samudhat, and Maranatik Samudhat. In the door of position, one
should know the position from the lowest to the Antarmahart and from the highest
to three thousand years. If the food is without obstruction, it is of the
Pudgalas of all six directions, and in the state of obstruction, it is sometimes
of the Pudgalas of three, sometimes four, and sometimes five directions. Even in
Lokanishkrut (the edge of the world), there is a possibility of Badar Vayukaya,
therefore, the state of obstruction can arise. The remaining doors should be
known like the subtle Vayukaya. In conclusion, it is said that O Ashyuman
Shraman! These beings are going to be in the Tiryanch Gati only, and they will
obtain the Tiryanch and Manushya Gati. They are each-bodied and are the measure
of the countless Lokakasha regions. This is the end of the statement about
Vayukaya.  ## Description of Audarik Trasas  **27. Who are called Audarik Trasa
beings?**  Audarik Trasa beings are said to be of four types, namely:
Dviindriya, Triindriya, Chaturindriya, and Panchendriya.  **Discussion:**  The
word 'Audarik' in the term 'Audarik Trasa' is a differentiator of Gati Trasa.
The term 'Ourala Tasa' is used to indicate the difference from the Gati Trasa in
the form of Tejas Kaya and Vayukaya.  Audarik means gross, primary.  Mainly,
Dviindriya etc. beings are intended in the form of Trasa, therefore, they are
called Audarik Trasa.  These are of four types: Dviindriya, Triindriya,
Chaturindriya, and Panchendriya.  **Dviindriya:** Beings who have two senses,
namely touch and taste, are Dviindriya.  **Triindriya:** Beings who have three
senses, namely touch, taste, and smell, are Triindriya.  **Chaturindriya:**
Beings who have four senses, namely touch, taste, smell, and sight, are
Chaturindriya.  **Panchendriya:** Beings who have five senses, namely touch,
taste, smell, sight, and hearing, are Panchendriya beings.  It has been said
earlier that this division of senses is with respect to Dravyaindriyas, not with
respect to Bhavaindriyas.

[70] [Jivajjovaabhigamsutra Dwiindriya-varnan 28. What are the Dwiindriya Jivas?
Dwiindriya Jivas are of many types, such as Pulaakrimik to Samudralikha. There
are many other types of Dwiindriya Jivas. These are broadly classified into two
types, namely, Paryapt and Aparyapt.    Bante! How many types of bodies do Jivas
have? Gotama! There are three types of bodies - Oral, Tey, and Kamma.   Bante!
How many types of body-acquisitions do Jivas have?   Just like the number of
fingers in a hand, there are twelve yojanas in the body. There are
Chevattasanghaya, Hundasanthiya, four Kasayas, four Sannaos, three Lesamos, two
Indriyas, Samugdhaaya-veyana, Kasaya, Marantiya, No Sani, Asanni,
Napusakavevaga, five Pajjattios, five Apajjattios, Sammaditti also, Micchavitti
also, Jo Sammimicchavitti, No Ohi Dasano, No Chakkhudansani, Bhachakkhudansani,
Go Kevaladansani.   Bante! Are Jivas Gnani or Agnani? Gotama! They are both
Gnani and Agnani. They are both Niyama Dunaani, such as Praminibhohiyapani
Suyanaano. Those who are Agnani are Niyama Duaani, Matiagnaani, and Suyagnaani.
They are not Manajogi, Vajjogi, or Kayajogi. They are both Sagarovautta and
Anagarovautta. Their Ahar is Niyama Chhadasi. Their Uvvaao is in Tirya-Manusse,
Neraiya, Dev, Asankhejjavasaauy, and Vajjesu. They live for twelve years, just
like the time it takes for the sun to set. They die both with and without Samoh.
Where do they go? They go to Neraiya, Dev, Asankhejjavasaauy, and Vajjesu. They
are Dugatiya, Duaagatiya, and Paritta Asankhejj. This is the Dwiindriya. [28]

## First Understanding: Description of Two-Sensed Beings  **O Bhagavan!** How
many bodies are said to be of these beings? **Gautama:** Three bodies are said
to be, namely - Odaric, Tejas and Karman.  **O Bhagavan!** How much is the
perception of the body of these beings said to be? **Gautama:** From the lowest,
an immeasurable part of an angul, and from the highest, twelve yojanas.  These
beings have Sewart-Sanhanan and Hund-Sansthan. They have four Kshayas, four
Sanjnas, three Leshyas and two Indriyas. They have three Samudghatas - Vedana,
Kshaya and Maranatik.  These beings are not Sanjni, they are Asanjni. They are
Napunsakaved-wala. They have five Paryaptis and five Aparyaptis.  They are both
Samyagdristi and Mithyadristi, but not Samyagmithyadristi (mixed vision). They
are not Avadhi-darshan-wala, not Chakshu-darshan-wala, they are Achakshu-
darshan-wala, not केवलदर्शन-wala.  **O Bhagavan!** Are these beings
knowledgeable or ignorant? **Gautama:** They are both knowledgeable and
ignorant. Those who are knowledgeable are, by rule, two knowledgeable - Mati-
gyani and Shruti-gyani.  Those who are ignorant are, by rule, two ignorant -
Mati-agyani and Shruti-agyani.  These beings are not Manoyog-wala, they are
Vachan-yog and Kay-yog-wala. These beings are both Sakar-upayog-wala and Anakar-
upayog-wala.  The food of these beings is, by rule, the Pudgalas of six
directions. Their Upapat (origin from another birth) is from the rest of the
Tiryanch and humans, except for the Naryik, Dev and those with an age of
countless years.  Their state is from the lowest, Antarmuhurt, and from the
highest, twelve years. They die both by Samvahat and Asamvahat from the
Maranatik Samudghata.  **O Bhagavan!** Where do they go after death?
**Gautama:** Except for the Naryik, Dev and Tiryanch humans with an age of
countless years, they go to the rest of the Tiryanch humans.  Therefore, these
beings go in two Gatis, they come from two Gatis, they are each-bodied and
countless. This is the description of the two-sensed beings.  **Discussion:**
While describing the types of two-sensed beings, the Sutrakar has said
"Pulakrimi Yavat Samudralikasha".  The word "Yavat" here should be taken to
include all those types of beings that are mentioned in the Prajnapanasutra
under the authority of two-sensed beings. The complete types are as follows:  *
**Pulakrimi:** Worms born in the excrement door. * **Kukshikrimi:** Worms born
in the Kukshi (abdomen). * **Gandoayalaka:** Gindola.

[72] One should know the following according to the traditions of the people:
Jeevajeevaabhigamsutra Golo, Nupur, Saumangalaka, Vanshimukh, Soochimukh,
Gojalouka, Jalouka (leech), Jaalayushk. Shankha - conch shells born in the sea.
Shankhanak - small conch shells born in the sea. Ghulla-Ghonghha / Khulla -
small conch shells shaped like sea shells / Varata Kaudias / Sautrika, Maulika,
Kalluyavas, Ekavart, Dwi-Pravart, Nandikavart, Shambuk, Matruvah - these are all
different types of conch shells. Sippisamputa - clams / Chandanak - axis (dice)
/ Samudralikasha - a type of worm / these and other similar worms born in dead
bodies should be understood as Dwindriya. These Dwindriya beings should be
understood as two types based on sufficient and insufficient. The examination of
the 23 doors of the body, etc., should be known in this way: * **Shariradwar** -
These beings have three bodies: Audarik, Taijas and Karman. * **Avgahanaadwar**
- The body-avgahana of these beings is from the countless parts of an angul to
the twelve yojanas. * **Sanhanandwar** - These beings have a chedavati-sevatam
sanhanan. Here, the main sanhanan should be taken, not the formal one. Because
these beings have bones. * **Sansthanadwar** - These beings have a hand-
sansthan. * **Kashayadwar** - All four kshayas are found in them. *
**Sanjnaadwar** - They have all four aharad, etc., sanjnas. * **Lenyadwar** -
These beings have three leshyas from the beginning: Krishna, Neel, Kapoth. *
**Indriyadwar** - They have two senses: touch and taste. * **Samudghatadwar** -
They have three samudghats: pain, kshaya and maranantik samudghat. *
**Sanjnaadwar** - These beings are not sanjni / they are asanjni. * **Vedadwar**
- These beings are napunsakavedi. They are sammuchim and those who are sammuchim
are napunsak. * **Tattvarth Sutra** says: "Narak and sammuchim are
napunsakavedi." * **Paryaptidwar** - These beings have five paryaptis compared
to sufficient beings and five aparyaptis compared to insufficient beings. *
**Drishtidwar** - These beings are both samyagdristi and mithyadristi, but not
mishradristi. This is clear: 1. Narakasamuchhino napunsakanni / Tattvarth Su.

## First Understanding: Description of the Two-Sensory Beings [73]  Just as a
bell, when struck, produces a great sound, and that sound gradually diminishes,
reaching only the hanging point, similarly, a being falling from Samyaktva
gradually falls, reaching the state of Saasvadan Samyaktva. Some beings with
Saasvadan Samyaktva, upon death, are born as Two-Sensory beings. Therefore, due
to the possibility of Saasvadan Samyaktva for a short time in the inadequate
state, they possess Samyagdristi.   For the rest of the time, they have
Mithyadristi, and due to the nature of existence, they do not have Tatharoop
Parinam, hence they do not possess Misradristi, and no being with Misradristi is
born among them. Because, "A being with Misradristi does not die in that state,"
is a statement from the scriptures.  **Darshan Dwaar:** They possess only
Achakṣudarshan, not Chakshudarshan, Avadhi Darshan, or Keval Darshan.  **Gyan
Dwaar:** They are both knowledgeable and ignorant. They are knowledgeable in
terms of Saasvadan Samyaktva. They are knowledgeable in Mati Gyan and Shruta
Gyan. They are ignorant in terms of Mithyadristi. They are ignorant in Mati
Agyan and Shruta Agyan.  **Yog Dwaar:** They are not Manoyogi, but they are
Vachanayogi and Kayayogi.  **Upayog Dwaar:** These beings are both Sakar Upayog
and Anakar Upayog.  **Aahar Dwaar:** These beings consume the six directions of
Pudgal according to the rules.  **Dwiindriyadi beings are only in the Trasanadi,
therefore the question of Vyaghat does not arise.**  **Upapat:** These beings
are born from the remaining Tiryanch-Manushya Gati, excluding Devas, Narakas,
and Tiryanch-Manushyas with an immeasurable lifespan.  **Sthiti:** The state of
these beings ranges from the lowest Antarmuhurt to the highest twelve years.
**Samavahat Dwaar:** They die both in Samavahat and Asamavahat.  **Chyavan
Dwaar:** These beings, upon death, are born as Tiryanch-Manushya, excluding
Devas, Narakas, and Tiryanch-Manushyas with an immeasurable lifespan.  **Gati-
Agati Dwaar:** These beings move in two Gatis and come from two Gatis. They are
each Shariri and countless.  **There are as many Dwiindriya beings as there are
Akash Pradesh in the long, single-region category above and below the Ghnikrit
Lok. This is the proof of their countless number.**  **Because even Prasankhyat
is of countless types.**  **These Dwiindriya beings, with their adequate and
inadequate states, have a total of seven lakh Jati Kulkodi, Yoni-prominent.**
**According to the ancient teachers, the Tiryanch Gati should be understood from
the Jatipad. Its Kuls are: Krimi, Keet, Vrischika, etc. These Kuls are Yoni-
prominent, meaning that there are many Kuls in a single Yoni.**  **For example,
in a single Yoni of cow dung or a piece of wood, there are Krimi, Keet, and
Vrischika Kuls, etc.**  **Similarly, in a single Yoni, there are...**  **"N
Sammmiicho Kunai Kaalam" - according to this statement...**

The Jiva's approach to the world is based on the principle of "Avantaar
Jaatibhed" (differentiation of species), which leads to a flow of births in
various species. There are seven lakh species of Dwindriya (two-sense) beings,
each with its own unique form of existence. This is the description of Dwindriya
beings.   The description of Triindriya (three-sense) beings begins from verse
29. What are Triindriya beings? Triindriya beings are said to be of many types,
such as: Aupayik, Rohini, Hastshishonda, and others similar to them. These are
broadly classified into two types: Paryapt (sufficient) and Aparyapt
(insufficient).   Similarly, all the descriptions given for Dwindriya beings
should be applied to Triindriya beings. The unique characteristic of Triindriya
beings is that their lifespan is three kos (a unit of distance), they have three
senses, and their lifespan ranges from a single moment to fifty nights and days.
All the descriptions given for Dwindriya beings should be applied to Triindriya
beings, including those that are described as having two movements, two forward
movements, each with a body, and countless others. This is the description of
Triindriya beings.   **Explanation:**  Triindriya beings are those who possess
three senses: touch, taste, and smell. They are classified into many types. The
Prajnapanasutra lists their classifications as follows: Aupayik, Rohini, Kanthu
(caterpillar), Pipilika (ant), Uddeshak, Uddehika (termite), Utkalik, Utpad,
Utkat, Trinaahar (grass-eating), Kasthahar (wood-eating), Maluk, Patraahar
(leaf-eating), Trina Vrintik, Patra Vrintik, Pushpa Vrintik, Phal Vrintik, Beej
Vrintik, Tenduran Majjik, Trapushbhijik, Kapas Sthibhijak, Hillik, Jhillik,
Jhigir (shrimp), Kigirit, Bahuk, Laghuk, Subhag, Sauvastik, Shukavritt,
Indrakaayik, Indragop (silk worm), Urulunchk, Kusthalvahak, Yuka (louse),
Halahal, Pishuk (flea or bedbug), Shatpadika (centipede), Gomhi (earwig), and
Hastshishonda.   Some of these types of Triindriya beings are well-known. The
rest should be understood based on specific regions or traditions. These
Triindriya beings are classified into two types: Paryapt (sufficient) and
Aparyapt (insufficient). All the descriptions given earlier apply to them.

## First Understanding: The Statement of Four-Sensed Beings [75]  They should be
known as similar to the two-sensed beings / The same statement should be made in
the thirty-three gates, only the difference is as follows: The body's
comprehension - the body's comprehension of the four-sensed beings is excellent,
three kos. Sensory gate - these beings have three senses. Position gate - their
position is from the lowest to the moment of death and the highest is fifty
nights and days. The rest of the statement should be made as they are of two
motions and two progressions, they are each embodied and they are countless /
They have eight lakh कुलकोडी / This is the statement of the three-sensed beings.
The statement of the four-sensed beings is from 30. To what house? The four-
sensed beings are of many types, such as the blind, the offspring, even the dung
beetle, and other beings of this type / These are briefly of two types -
sufficient and insufficient / O Bhagavan! How many bodies are said to be of
these beings? Gautama! Three bodies are said to be. Thus, the previous statement
should be made / The special feature is that their excellent body-comprehension
is four kos, they have four senses, they are sighted and blind. Their position
is excellent, six months / The rest of the statement should be made like the
three-sensed beings, as they are said to be countless / This is the statement of
the four-sensed beings.   **Discussion:** In the Prajñāpanā Sūtra, the
distinctions of the four-sensed beings are described as follows: Blind,
offspring (eyed), fly, mosquito, insect (locust), butterfly, beetle, rooster,
hen, Nanda-vart, lizard, black-winged, blue-winged, red-winged, green-winged,
white-winged, painted-winged, variegated-winged, ...

The Jiva-Jiva-Migam Sutra states that the **Bhavadharaniy** perception of the
**Naryik** beings is from an **asankhyat** part of an **anguli** (finger) to
**five hundred dhanush** (bows) in the **jghanya** (lowest) and **utkrisht**
(highest) respectively. The **Uttarvaikriya** perception is from an
**asankhyat** part of an **anguli** to **one thousand yojan** in the **jghanya**
and **utkrisht** respectively.   **Bhawan:** How is the body of these beings
constituted?  **Gautam:** They do not have any of the six types of **sanhann**
(constitution) because their bodies do not have **haddi** (bone), **nadi**
(vein), or **snayu** (muscle). The **pudgal** that are **anishta** (unpleasant),
**akant** (unwanted), **apriya** (unloved), **ashubh** (inauspicious),
**amanojnya** (unacceptable), and **amanam** (unwanted) gather together to form
their bodies.  **Bhawan:** What is the **sansthan** (structure) of their bodies?
**Gautam:** Their bodies are of two types: **Bhavadharaniy** and
**Uttarvaikriya**. The **Bhavadharaniy** bodies are of **hund** (round)
structure, and the **Uttarvaikriya** bodies are also of **hund** structure.
These **Naryik** beings have **four kshaya** (passions), **four sanjna**
(consciousness), **three leshya** (tendencies), **five indriya** (senses), and
**four samudghat** (initial stages). They are both **sanjni** (conscious) and
**asanjni** (unconscious). They are **napuंसक** (neuter) **ved** (knowledge)
holders. They have **six paryapti** (sufficiency) and **six aparyapti**
(insufficiency). They have **three drishti** (vision) and **three darshan**
(perception). They are both **gyani** (knowledgeable) and **agyani** (ignorant).
The **gyani** beings have **three types of knowledge** according to the rules:
**bhatigyani** (knowledge of the past), **shrutigyani** (knowledge from
scriptures), and **avadhigyani** (clairvoyance). The **agyani** beings have
either **two types of ignorance** or **three types of ignorance**. The two types
of ignorance are **matiagyani** (knowledge from reasoning) and **shrutagyani**
(knowledge from scriptures). The three types of ignorance are **matiagyani**,
**shrutagyani**, and **vibhanga** (knowledge of the parts). They have **three
yog** (types of effort), **two upayog** (types of use), and **six disha**
(directions) of **ahar grahan** (food intake). They usually consume **kala**
(black) **pradi** (primary) **pudgal** as food. They are born as **Naryik**
beings after receiving **tiyanch** (animals) and **manushya** (humans). Their
**sthiiti** (duration) is from **ten thousand years** in the **jghanya** to
**thirty-three sagaropama** (ocean-like) in the **utkrisht**. They die in both
**samavahat** (simultaneous) and **asamavahat** (non-simultaneous) ways. After
death, they are reborn as **garbhja** (born from womb), **tiryanch** (animals),
and **manushya** (humans). They do not go to **sammuchim** (heaven). Therefore,
**Ayushman Shraman**, they are said to be **two gati** (types of movement),
**two agati** (types of arrival), **each shariri** (body-possessing), and
**asankhyat** (innumerable).  This is the description of the **Naryik** beings.
**Vivechan:** This Sutra describes the types of **Naryik** beings through
**twenty-three dvara** (gates). There are **seven types of Naryik beings**: 1.
**Ratnaprabhaprithvi-Naryik**, 2. **Sharkaraprabhaprithvi-Naryik**, 3.
**Valukaprabha-Naryik**, 4. **Pankaprabhaprithvi-Naryik**, 5.
**Dhumaprabhaprithvi-Naryik**, 6. **Tamahprabhaprithvi-Naryik**, and 7.
**Adhasaptamapৃthvi-Naryik**. In short, these **Naryik** beings are of two
types: **paryapt** (sufficient) and **aparyapt** (insufficient).  The
**sharira** (body) **dvara** (gate) of the **Naryik** beings is as follows: They
do not have **oudarik** (material) bodies. Their bodies are **vaikriya**
(changeable) by nature. Therefore, they have **three types of bodies**:
**vaikriya**, **taijas** (luminous), and **karman** (karmic).  Their
**avagahana** (perception) is of two types: **Bhavadharaniy** and
**Uttarvaikriya**. The **Bhavadharaniy** is the perception that is present from
birth. The **Uttarvaikriya** is the perception that is created later in a
**vichitra** (strange) form for the **vairi** (enemy) **narak** (hell)
**pratighāt** (resistance) in the **bhavanter** (future life).

## [79 First Chapter: Description of Narakas]  The depth of the Narakas' descent
into the Bhavadharani is an immeasurable fraction of an angul (finger width) at
the time of birth. The highest depth is 500 dhanush (bows). This highest
measurement is in relation to the seventh earth. Their depth of descent into the
Uttarvaikriyika is an immeasurable fraction of an angul at the lowest and 1000
dhanush at the highest. This highest measurement is in relation to the seventh
Naraka-bhoomi (hell). The highest depth of descent into the Bhavadharani and
Uttarvaikriyika of different Narakas should be known from this table:  | Earth
Name | Bhavadharani Depth | Uttarvaikriyika Depth | |---|---|---| | (1)
Ratnapraba | 7 dhanush 6 angul 15 | 12 angul | | (2) Sharkarapraba | 15 dhanush
12 angul | 31 dhanush | | (3) Balukapraba | 31 dhanush 62 dhanush | 62 dhanush |
| (4) Pankapraba | 62 dhanush 125 dhanush | 125 dhanush | | (5) Dhumapraba | 125
dhanush 250 dhanush | 250 dhanush | | (6) Tamahpraba | 250 dhanush 500 dhanush |
500 dhanush | | (7) Adhasaptamapৃথিবী | 500 dhanush | 1000 dhanush |  The bodies
of Naraka beings are not made of any of the six types of sahnana
(conglomeration). They do not have any veins (arteries) or nerves (small veins),
nor do they have bones. The definition of sahnana is the accumulation of bones.
Since Narakas do not have bones, the question of sahnana does not arise.  One
might wonder that the Sewart sahnana was mentioned for the Ekendriya beings, but
they also do not have bones. The solution is that Ekendriya beings have an
Audarik (formal) body, and the Sewart sahnana is mentioned in relation to that
body. In reality, only the Asthinichayatmak (bone-accumulating) is sahnana.  In
Prajnapana and other texts, Devas (gods) are said to have Vana sahnana, but that
is also said in a secondary sense and only as a formality. Devas have the power
to uproot mountains, and they do not experience any physical exertion or fatigue
in this task. Therefore, they are called Vajra sahnani (diamond-like). In
reality, they are Asahnanani (without sahnana).  One might doubt that "special
power is called sahnana." According to this definition, it might be possible to
consider Devas as having sahnana in the main sense. This doubt is contradicted
by the principle, because in the same sutra, the definition of sahnana is given
as "Asthinichayatmak," and it is clearly stated that in the absence of bones,
Narakas do not have any of the six sahnanas.  Again, one might doubt that if
Narakas do not have sahnana, how does their body bind? The sutrakar (author of
the sutra) answers this by saying that their body binds like the Pudgalaskandha
(matter-aggregates). The Pudgal that is anist (unpleasant), akant (unfavorable),
apriya (unpleasant), ashubh (inauspicious), amanojna (unattractive), and amanam
(unworthy) becomes the form of their body.

## Translation:  [80] The commentator of the *Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra* has
explained the meaning of terms like *anishta* (undesirable) as follows:  *
**Anishta:** That which is not even desired, extremely unpleasant, not pleasing,
having extremely inauspicious color etc., unpleasant, causing aversion upon
sight, inauspicious - having bad color, smell, taste, touch. * **Amanognya:**
That which does not generate joy in the mind because its result is painful. *
**Amanam:** That which does not evoke interest.  **Sansthanadwar:** The bodies
of hell beings are of two types: *bhavadharani* (those that sustain their
existence) and *uttarvaikriya* (those that undergo transformation). Both types
have *hundasansthan* (bodies resembling a dog). Due to their nature, the bodies
of hell beings are extremely repulsive, like a bird with plucked feathers and
neck, resembling a *rom-pakshi* (a bird with plucked feathers). While undergoing
transformation, hell beings desire to have auspicious bodies, but due to the
arising of extremely inauspicious *karma*, they are only able to create
extremely inauspicious bodies, which are also *hundasansthan*.  **Kashayadwar:**
All four *kashayas* (passions) are present in hell beings.  **Sanjnadwar:** All
four *sanjnas* (types of consciousness) are found in hell beings.
**Lenyadwar:** The first three inauspicious *leshyas* (shades of color) -
*krishna* (black), *nila* (blue), and *kapota* (grey) - are found in hell
beings. In the first and second hell realms, *kapota* is present; in the third,
*kapota* is present in some regions and *nila* in others; in the fourth, *nila*
is present; in the fifth, *nila* is present in some regions and *krishna* in
others; in the sixth, *krishna* is present; and in the seventh, *param krishna*
(supreme black) is present.  **Bhagawatisutra** states: "In the first two hells,
*kapota* is present; in the third, *misra* (mixture of *kapota* and *nila*) is
present; in the fourth, *nila* is present; in the fifth, *misra* (mixture of
*nila* and *krishna*) is present; in the sixth, *krishna* is present; and in the
seventh, *param krishna* is present."  **Indriyadwar:** Hell beings have five
senses: touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing.  **Samudghatadwar:** They have
four *samudghatas* (types of suffering): *vedana* (pain), *kashaya* (passions),
*vaikriya* (transformation), and *maranantik* (death).  **Sanjidwar:** Hell
beings are both *sanji* (conscious) and *asanji* (unconscious). Those who die as
hell beings after being born in the womb are called *sanji*, and those who are
born from *samuchchima* (aggregates) are called *asanji*.  They are only born in
the *ratnaprabha* (first hell), not in the subsequent hells. This is because the
result of an inauspicious action performed without deliberation is limited. It
is said that *asanji* beings are born in the first hell, reptiles in the second,
birds in the third, lions in the fourth, snakes in the fifth, women in the
sixth, and humans and fish in the seventh.  1. **Kaau ya dosu taiyaae misiya
nilaiya chautthie / panchamiyaae misa, kanha tatto paramkanha //
Bhagawatisutra** 2. **Prasanni khalu padham doccham va sirisava taiya pakkhi.
Siha jati chautthi uraga pun panchmi pudhavi / / chhatti va itthiatro maccha
bhanuya ya sattami pudhadi. Eso paramovano boddhhabo narayapudhavisu //**

## First Understanding: Description of the Five-Sensed Transmigratory Beings
**The Gate of the Vedas:** Hell-bound beings are always eunuchs.   **The Gate of
Fulfillment:** They have six fulfillments and six unfulfillments. The
commentator has mentioned five fulfillments and five unfulfillments due to the
oneness of speech and mind.  **The Gate of Vision:** Hell-bound beings have
three types of vision: 1. False vision, 2. Right vision, and 3. Mixed vision.
**The Gate of Perception:** They have three types of perception: 1. Eye
perception, 2. Non-eye perception, and 3. Clairvoyance.  **The Gate of
Knowledge:** They are both knowledgeable and ignorant. Those who are
knowledgeable are, by rule, intellectually knowledgeable, scripturally
knowledgeable, and clairvoyant. Those who are ignorant are intellectually
ignorant, scripturally ignorant, and have fragmented knowledge. The meaning is
that hell-bound beings who are unconscious are ignorant in two ways in the
unfulfilled state and in three ways in the fulfilled state. Conscious hell-bound
beings are ignorant in three ways in both states.  **The Gate of Yoga:** Hell-
bound beings have three types of yoga: 1. Mental yoga, 2. Speech yoga, and 3.
Body yoga.  **The Gate of Use:** Hell-bound beings are both corporeal and
incorporeal.  **The Gate of Sustenance:** Hell-bound beings are not on the
outskirts of the world, but in the middle. Therefore, they do not have any
obstacles. Hence, they receive karmic particles from all six directions and
mostly receive karmic particles of bad color, smell, taste, and touch.  **The
Gate of Rebirth:** Hell-bound beings are born from five-sensed transmigratory
beings and humans who have a lifespan of countless years, except for those who
have a lifespan of countless years. They are not born from other realms.  **The
Gate of Position:** The lowest position of hell-bound beings is ten thousand
years, and the highest position is thirty-three oceans. The lowest position
should be understood in relation to the first hell, and the highest position
should be understood in relation to the seventh hell.  **The Gate of
Simultaneous Death:** Hell-bound beings die both with and without simultaneous
death.  **The Gate of Upward Movement:** Hell-bound beings, after leaving their
state, are born as five-sensed transmigratory beings and humans, except for
those who have a lifespan of countless years. They are not born as humans who
have a lifespan of countless years.  **The Gate of Movement and Return:** Hell-
bound beings, after death, go to transmigratory beings and humans. Therefore,
they have two movements and are born from transmigratory beings and humans.
Therefore, they have two returns.  O Venerable Ascetic! These hell-bound beings
are all embodied and countless. This is the description of the Naryikas.
**Description of the Five-Sensed Transmigratory Beings:**  33. What are the
five-sensed transmigratory beings? The five-sensed transmigratory beings are of
two types:

## First Understanding: Description of Aquatic Creatures  **All living beings in
the world, whether they are in the realm of the liberated or the bound, in the
four directions, in the skies, among humans, in the realms of karma, not in the
realms of no karma, in the inter-islands, in the realm of countless lifetimes,
or in the realm of countless lifetimes, even in the realm of gods, up to the
realm of the gods of the four directions, the two directions, and the realm of
countless lifetimes, are all described as such.**  **What are aquatic creatures?
Aquatic creatures are said to be of five types: fish, tortoise, crocodile,
snake, and dolphin (sunsumar). What are fish? Fish are of many types, etc. This
should be known according to the description of the knowledge. In this way,
other types of fish, etc., all these aquatic creatures are five-sense, non-
human, living beings, in short, they are of two types: sufficient and
insufficient.**  **O Lord! How many bodies are said to be of these beings?
Gautama! Three bodies are said to be: Audarik, Tejas, and Karman.**  **Their
body's size is from the smallest, an immeasurable part of a finger, to the
largest, a thousand yojanas.**  **They are those who endure service, have a body
like a lump, have four passions, four types of consciousness, and five types of
karma. They have five senses and three types of death.**  **They are not
conscious, they are unconscious. They are eunuchs with knowledge. They have five
sufficiencies and five insufficiencies. They have two types of vision, two types
of perception, two types of knowledge, two types of ignorance, two types of
yoga, two types of use, and their food is the six directions of dust
particles.**  **They are born from non-human and human beings, not from gods and
hell beings. Even among non-humans, those with countless years of life are not
born among them. Humans with countless years of life in the realm of no karma
and in the inter-islands are also not born among them. Their lifespan is from
the smallest, an instant, to the largest, a previous kalpa.**  **They die both
with and without the death-causing karma.**  **O Lord! Where are these five-
sense aquatic creatures born after death? Gautama! They are born in hell, among
non-humans, among humans, and among gods. If they are born in hell, they are
born only up to the Ratnaprabha hell, not in the other hells. If they are born
among non-humans, they are born among all non-humans, both those with a
countable lifespan and those with an uncountable lifespan, both among four-
legged creatures and birds.**  **If they are born among humans, they are born
among all humans in the realm of karma, not among humans in the realm of no
karma. They are also born among those with a countable lifespan and those with
an uncountable lifespan in the inter-islands.**

## 84] The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra are born. If they are born in the Devas, they
are born in the Vanavyantara Devas (not in the Praage Devas). ... These Jivas
are said to be those who go to four Gatis, those who come from two Gatis, those
who have every body, and those who are innumerable. This is the description of
the Jalachar Samucchim Panchaindriya Tiryanchas.   **Discussion:** (Sutras 33 to
35) The present Sutras have described the five types of Samucchim Jalachar
Tiryancha Panchaindriya Jivas - Matsya, Kachhap, Makar, Graha, and Susumar, but
have directed to the Prajnapanasutra for the types of Matsya etc. / The
Prajnapanasutra describes these types as follows:  **Types of Matsya:**
Shlakshna Matsya, Khavalla Matsya, Yuga Matsya, Bhibbhiya Matsya, Heliy Machch,
Manjaria Machch, Rohit Machch, Halisaagar, Mogaravad, Vadgar Timimatch,
Timingala Machch, Tandal Machch, Kanikk Machch, Silechchia Machch, Lambhan
Machch, Pataaka Matsya, Pataakatipataaka Matsya, Nakra Matsya, and many more
like these.  **Types of Kachhap:** There are two types of Kachhapas -
Asthikachhap and Mansalakachhap.  **Types of Graha:** There are five types of
Grahas - Dili, Vedhag, Mudug, Pulug, and Simaagar.  **Types of Makar:** There
are two types of Makars - Sond Makar and Mritt Makar.  **Types of Susumar:**
There is only one type of Susumar.  **All these Matsya etc. are of two types,
according to the Parayapta and Aparayapta Bhed, of the Jalachar Samucchim
Panchaindriya Tiryancha, etc. One should know this description as before. The
consideration of the Sharira etc. 23 Dvars should be known like the
Chaturindriya. / The special feature is that their Jghanya Avagahana in the
Avagahanadvar is an innumerable part of an Angul, and the Utkrishta is one
thousand Yojanas. In the Indriyadvar, they should be said to have five Indriyas.
/ In the Sanjidvar, they are Asanji, not Sanji - because of being Samucchim,
they are not Samanaska (Sanji). In the Upapatadvar, they are born from the
Tiryanchas and Manusyas, except for those who have an innumerable lifespan. In
the Sthitidvar, their Jghanya is Antarmuhurta, and their Utkrishta is Purvakoti.
In the Udvartanaadvar, they are born in all four Gatis. / If they are born in
Naraka, they are born only in the first Ratnaprabha, not in the further Narakas.
/ They are born in all types of Tiryanchas. In Manusyas, they are born in the
Manusyas of Karmabhoomi. / In Devas, they are born in Bhavanapati and
Vanavyantara.

## First Understanding: Description of Terrestrial Animals  **Quadrupedal
Terrestrial Animals:** There are four types of quadrupedal terrestrial animals,
namely: single-hooved, double-hooved, ghandipad (elephant-like) and sankahapad
(with claws).  All other similar quadrupedal terrestrial animals are also
included in this category.  They are broadly classified into two types:
sufficient and insufficient.  Their body size ranges from an infinitesimal
fraction of an angul (finger width) to a maximum of 9 yojan (a yojan is
approximately 8 miles).  Their lifespan ranges from a moment to a maximum of
84,000 years.  The lifespan of other aquatic animals should be understood in a
similar manner.  These animals are capable of moving in four directions and
returning in two directions, and they are both individual and innumerable.  This
concludes the description of quadrupedal terrestrial animals, which are five-
sensed, non-human beings.  **Reptile Terrestrial Animals:** What are reptile
terrestrial animals?  There are two types of reptile terrestrial animals: snake
reptiles and lizard reptiles.  What are snake reptiles?  There are four types of
snake reptiles: ahi (cobra), ajagar (python), asaliya (non-venomous snake) and
mahorag (large snake).  What are ahi?  There are two types of ahi: darvikar
(hooded) and mukuli (non-hooded).  What are darvikar?  There are many types of
darvikar, such as pashvisha (venomous) and others.  This concludes the
description of darvikar.  What are mukuli?  There are many types of mukuli, such
as divy (divine) and gonas (non-divine).  This concludes the description of
mukuli.  What are ajagar?  There is only one type of ajagar.  This concludes the
description of ajagar.  What are asaliya?  The description of asaliya should be
understood according to the Prajnapanasutra.  What are mahorag?  The description
of mahorag should be understood according to the Prajnapanasutra.  All other
similar snake reptiles are broadly classified into two types: sufficient and
insufficient.  The rest should be understood as before.  Specifically, their
body size ranges from an infinitesimal fraction of an angul to a maximum of 9
yojan.  Their lifespan ranges from a moment to a maximum of 75,000 years.  The
rest should be understood in a similar manner as aquatic animals.  These
creatures are capable of moving in four directions and returning in two
directions, and they are both individual and innumerable.  This concludes the
description of snake reptiles.  **Lizard Reptiles:** What are lizard reptiles?
There are many types of lizard reptiles, such as goh (gecko) and nevala
(mongoose).  All other similar lizard reptiles are also included in this
category.  They are broadly classified into two types: sufficient and
insufficient.  Their body size ranges from an infinitesimal fraction of an angul
to a maximum of 9 dhanush (dhanush is a unit of length, approximately 4 feet).

[88] [From the most excellent position of the Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra, forty-two
thousand years / Like the rest of the aquatic creatures, it should be said that
these four-motioned, two-motioned, each-bodied and innumerable / This is the
statement of the Bhujaga-Parisarpa Samuchchimas / Along with this, the statement
of the terrestrial creatures is also complete. What is the form of the Khechara?
Khechara has been said to be of four types, namely Charmapkshi, Romapakshi,
Samudgakpakshi and Vittapakshi. What are Charmapkshi? Charmapkshi are of many
types, such as Valguli, etc. Other similar Charmapkshi / What are Romapakshi?
Romapakshi are of many types, such as Dhank, Kank, etc. Other similar Romapakshi
/ What are Samudgakpakshi? / These are of only one type / As said in the
Prajnapan, it should be known / Similarly, Vittapakshi should also be known
according to the Pannawana. These Khechara have been said to be of two types in
brief - sufficient and insufficient, etc. as before / The special feature is
that their Sharira-Avagahana is innumerable parts of an angul from the lowest
and the highest Dhanush-Prithaktva / The position is the most excellent seventy-
two thousand years. It should be known like all the other aquatic creatures,
Khechara are four-motioned, two-motioned, each-bodied and innumerable. This is
the description of the Khechara. Along with this, the statement of the
Samuchchima Panchendriya Tiryanch Yoni is complete. Discussion - After
describing the aquatic creatures in the previous Sutra, the Samuchchima
terrestrial and Khechara have been described in this Sutra. Samuchchima
Panchendriya Tiryanch terrestrial creatures are of two types - Chatushpad and
Parisarpa / Those who have four legs are Chatushpad, such as Ashwa, Bail, etc. /
Those who walk on their bellies or with the help of their arms are Parisarpa,
such as Sarpa, Nakul, etc. / The two Chakaras in the Sutra are indicative of
many differences in the self. Chatushpad terrestrial creatures are of four types
- one-hoofed, two-hoofed, Gandipad and Sankahapad / The Prajnapan Sutra has
described the types of these four, which are as follows: One-hoofed are of many
types, such as - Ashwa, Ashwatara (Khechara), Ghotak (horse), Gardabha,
Gorakshar, Kandalak, Shrikandalak and Avartak, etc. / Two-hoofed are of many
types, such as - Ont, Bail, Gavaya (blue cow), Rojh, Pashuk, Mahish (buffalo),
Mrig, Sambhar, Baraha, Aj (goat), Elk (sheep or goat), Ruru, Sarbha, Chamar
(chamari cow), Kurang, Gokarn, etc. / _ Gandopad - Gandi means Eran / Those who
have feet like Eran are Gandipad. These are of many types, such as - Hathi,
Hastiputanak, Matkun Hasti (small stature elephant without teeth), Khadgi and
Genda /

Parashara, Shrigala (jackal), Vidala (cat), Shvana, Kolasvana, Kokantika (fox),
Shashaka (rabbit), cheetah and Chittala (chital) etc. / In these quadruped
terrestrial animals, the distinction between sufficient and insufficient and the
consideration of the aforementioned 23 doors should be known in the same way as
aquatic animals, only the difference is as follows. Their body's depth is
countless parts of the smallest finger and the best Gavyu-prithaktva (two kos to
nine kos) / In the Agam, the meaning of prithaktva is from two to nine. Their
duration is the smallest in the form of Antarmuhurta and the best is eighty-four
thousand years. The rest of the description is the same as that of aquatic
animals / As long as they are those who go in all four directions, those who
come from two directions, those who have every body and those who are countless

[90] When the Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra is present, then the Prasalika is generated
in the aforementioned places in a Samuchchhim form. It has an Avagahana (at the
time of birth) as small as an infinitesimal part of an Angula and an Avagahana
as large as twelve Yojanas, and its length and width are also similar. It breaks
out of the aforementioned land of Skandhavar Praadi. It is Asangni, Mithyadristi
and Agnani and dies after experiencing the lifespan of an Antarmuhurt. It is not
a Prasalika Garbhaja, it is only Samuchchhim. It does not exist outside the
Manushya Kshetra. This is the description of the Prasalika. In the Mahorag-
Prajnapanasutra, the description of the Mahorag is as follows: Mahorags have
been described in many ways, such as: some Mahorags are one Angula in size, some
are Angulaprithaktva, some are Vitasti (twelve Angulas) in size, some are
Vitastiprithaktva, some are one Ratni (hand) in size, some are Ratniprithaktva
(from two hands to nine hands), some are Kukshi (two hands) in size, some are
Kukshiprithaktva, some are Dhanush (four hands) in size, some are
Dhanushprithaktva, some are Gavyuati (Kos or two thousand Dhanush) in size, some
are Gavyuatiprithaktva in size, some are Yojan (four Kos) in size, some are
Yojanprithaktva in size. (Some are one hundred Yojanas in size, some are two
hundred to nine hundred Yojanas in size, and some are even thousands of Yojanas
in size.)* These are born on land but also move in water like land and also on
land. They are not here, they are in the islands and seas outside the Manushya
Kshetra. They are also born in mountains, Devanagari Praadi places in the seas.
Not in water. There are also other types of Mahorags like this, which are ten
Angulas in size. This Avagahana is based on the measurement of Utsedhangula. The
measurement of the body is also based on Utsedhangula. Thus, Ahi, Ajagar, etc.
Urahparisarp Sthalachar Samuchchhim Panchendriya Tiryanch Yoni जीव are briefly
of two types: Paryapt and Ayaryapt, etc. The statement and the consideration of
23 Dvars should be known like the Jalachars. There is a difference between
Avagahana and Sthiti Dvar. Their Avagahana is from an infinitesimal part of an
Angula to Yojanprithaktva. Sthiti is from Antarmuhurt to Tirepan thousand years.
The rest is as before, as long as these are four गति वाले, two आगति वाले,
प्रत्येकशरीरी and असंख्यात. * The part in brackets should be understood in
relation to Garbhaja Mahorag.   In the Bhujagparisarp-Prajnapanasutra, the types
of Bhujagparisarp are described as follows: Goh, Nakul, Sarat (chameleon),
Shalya, Saranth, Sar, Khar, Grihakokila (house lizard), Vishambhra (Vasumbhra),
Mushak, Mangus (squirrel), Payolatik, Kshirvidalika, etc. other similar
Bhujaparisaarp Tiryanch. This Bhujagparisarp is briefly of two types: Paryapt
and Aparyapt. The rest of the description should be understood as before. The
statement should be made like the Jalachars in the consideration of twenty-three
Dvars, only the difference between Avagahana Dvar and Sthiti Dvar should be
known. Their Avagahana is from an infinitesimal part of an Angula to
Dhanushprithaktva. Sthiti is from Antarmuhurt to Bayali thousand years. The rest
is as before, as long as these जीव are four गति वाले, two आगति वाले,
प्रत्येकशरीरी and असंख्यात.

## First Understanding: Description of Land-Dwellers [91]  There are four types
of flying creatures (Khechar-Khechar): **Skin-winged**, **Hair-winged**, **Sea-
winged**, and **Spread-winged**.  **Skin-winged:** These have wings made of
skin. Their types are described in the **Prajnapana** as follows: **Vaggulī**
(bat), **Jalauka** (leech), **Adilī**, **Bharandapaksi** (bird of prey),
**Jīvanjīva**, **Samudra-vāyas**, **Karṇa-trika**, **Pakṣī-viḍālī**, etc.
**Hair-winged:** These have wings made of hair. Their types are described in the
**Prajnapana Sutra** as follows: **Dhaṅka**, **Kaṅka**, **Kural**, **Vāyas**,
**Chakravāka**, **Haṁsa**, **Kalahaṁsa**, **Rājahaṁsa** (red-beaked and red-
winged swan), **Pādahaṁsa**, **Pāḍa**, **Seḍī**, **Vaka**, **Balākā** (flock of
cranes), **Pāriplāva**, **Krauncha**, **Sārasa**, **Mesara**, **Masūra**,
**Mayūra**, **Shatavatsa** (seven-hand span), **Gahira**, **Pauṇḍaroka**,
**Kāka**, **Kāmanjuka**, **Banjulka**, **Tītara**, **Vartaka** (duck), **Lāva**,
**Kapota**, **Kapijala**, **Pārava**, **Chiṭaka**, **Chāsa**, **Kukkuṭa**,
**Shuka**, **Varhi** (a type of peacock), **Madana-śalākā** (myna), **Kokila**,
**Seha**, and **Varillka**, etc.  **Sea-winged:** These fly but their wings
remain like a chest. They are of only one type. They are not found in human
regions, but in outer islands and seas.  **Spread-winged:** These have wings
that are always spread out. They are of only one type. They are not found in
human regions, but in outer islands and seas.  These flying creatures are of two
types based on their **Sammūchhima** (aggregate) **Tiryach** (non-human)
**Panchendriya** (five senses) **Paryāpta** (sufficient) and **Aparyāpta**
(insufficient) characteristics. Their description is similar to the previous
ones.  The examination of their body, entrances, etc., should be done like that
of aquatic creatures. The difference lies in their entrances and positions.
Their **utkṛṣṭa** (highest) entrance is **dhanuṣa-pṛthaktva** (bow-separation)
and their position is **bahत्तर हजार वर्ष** (seventy-two thousand years).  These
creatures are of four gaits, two progressions, each-bodied, and innumerable.
There are two **sangrahaṇī** (collection) verses in some copies that describe
their position and entrance. They are as follows:  **जोयणसहस्स गाउयपुहुत्त तत्तो
य जोयणपुहत्तं  /  दोण्हं पि धणपुहत्तं समुच्छिम वियगपक्खीणं  // 1 //**  **संमुच्छ
पुग्धकोडी चउरासीई भवे सहस्साई। तेवण्णा बायाला बावत्तरिमेव पक्खीणं  // 2 //**
Their meaning is as follows:  The highest entrance of **Sammūchhima** aquatic
creatures is **thousand yojanas**, that of quadrupeds is **gavyu-ti** (kos)
separation, that of **ur-parisarp** (reptiles) is **yojana-pṛthaktva**, that of
**Sammūchhima** **bhujaga-parisarp** (snakes) and birds is **dhanuṣa-
pṛthaktva**.  The highest position of **Sammūchhima** aquatic creatures is
**pūrva-koṭī**, that of quadrupeds is **eighty-four thousand years**, that of
**ur-parisarp** is **thirty-five thousand years**, that of **bhujaga-parisarp**
is **forty-two thousand years**, and that of birds is **seventy-two thousand
years**.  This is the statement about **Sammūchhima** **Panchendriya**
**Tiryach-yonika** (non-human five-sense beings).

Jīvājīvābhigamasūtra Garbhaja Pañcendriya Tiryañcas' Description  What are the
Garbhavakrāntika Pañcendriya Tiryañcayonīs?  The Garbhavakrāntika Pañcendriya
Tiryañcayonīs are said to be of three types, namely - Jalyarā, Thalyarā, and
Khahyarā.  Description of Jalyarā Garbhaja: The Jalyarā are said to be of five
types, namely - Macchā, Kacchabhā, Magarā, Gāhā, and Susumārā. Their varieties
and characteristics are to be understood in the same way as described in the
Prajñāpanā, up to those of the same kind.  Embodied Souls (Jīvas): The embodied
souls are said to be of four types, namely - Audārika, Vaikriyika, Taijasa, and
Kārmaṇa.  Body Dimensions: The minimum body dimension is the infinitesimal part
of an aṅgula, and the maximum is one thousand yojanas.  Six Types of Saṃghāṭana:
The six types of Saṃghāṭana are - Vaharosabhanārāyasaṃghāṭanā,
Usabhanārāyasaṃghāṭanā, Nārāyasaṃghāṭanā, Addhānārāyasaṃghāṭanā,
Koliyāsaṃghāṭanā, and Sevatthasaṃghāṭanā.  Six Types of Saṃṭhāna: The six types
of Saṃṭhāna are - Samacatuarasaṃṭhānā, Jaggodhaparimaṇḍalasaṃṭhānā,
Sādisaṃṭhānā, Khujaasaṃṭhānā, Vāmaṇasaṃṭhānā, and Huṇḍasaṃṭhānā.  Kasāyas,
Saṃjñās, Leśās, Indriyas, Samudghātās, Saṃjñī, Asaṃjñī, Vedas, Prajñaptis,
Dṛṣṭis, Darśanas, Jñānas, and Yogas are also described.  Upapātas
(Transmigrations): The Upapātas range from Nāraka (hell) to Anuttara (highest
celestial realm), including all Tiryañc (animals) with innumerable life-spans,
Manuṣyas (humans) without Karmabhūmi (spiritual development), Antardvīpa
(intermediate realms), and Devas up to Sāhasrāra (thousand-fold celestial
realm).  The minimum duration of stay is less than a muhūrta, and the maximum is
a puṣkaroḍī.  Both types (of embodied souls) die.  After death, they are reborn
in Nāraka realms up to Anuttara, Tiryañc realms, all Manuṣyas, and Devas up to
Sāhasrāra. The Caturgatika (four-gati) and Caturāgantika (four-āgati) are said
to be innumerable.  This is the description of Jalyarā.

## First Understanding: Description of Aquatic Creatures Born from the Womb [38]
What are aquatic creatures born from the womb? These aquatic creatures are of
five types: fish, tortoise, crocodile, snake, and whale. The distinctions of all
these should be explained according to the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra*, as follows:
These aquatic creatures born from the womb are briefly of two types: sufficient
and insufficient.  O Lord! How many bodies are said to be possessed by these
beings?  Gautama! Four bodies are said to be possessed by them, such as the
*audārika*, *vaikriya*, *taijas*, and *kārmaṇa*.  Their body size ranges from an
immeasurable fraction of an inch at the lowest to a thousand yojanas at the
highest.  These beings have six types of cohesion, such as *vajrarṣabhanārāca
saṁhanana*, *ṛṣabhanārāca saṁhanana*, *nārāca saṁhanana*, *ardhanārāca
saṁhanana*, *kolikā saṁhanana*, and *sevārta saṁhanana*.  The structure of the
bodies of these beings is of six types: *samacaturastra saṁsthāna*, *nyagrodha
parimandala saṁsthāna*, *sādī saṁsthāna*, *kubja saṁsthāna*, *vāmana saṁsthāna*,
and *huṇḍa saṁsthāna*.  All these beings have *kaṣāya*, four types of *saṁjñā*,
six *leśyā*, five senses, and the first five *samudghāta*. These beings are
conscious, not unconscious.  They possess three *veda*, six sufficiencies, six
insufficiencies, three *dṛṣṭi*, and three *darśana*. These beings are both
knowledgeable and ignorant.  Those who are knowledgeable are either those with
two types of knowledge or those with three types of knowledge. Those with two
types of knowledge possess *matijñāna* and *śruta jñāna*. Those with three types
of knowledge possess *matijñāna*, *śruta jñāna*, and *avadhi jñāna* by rule.
Similarly, the ignorant are also of these types.  These beings possess three
*yoga* and both *upayoga*. Their food intake is from all six directions. These
beings are born from *nairyika* as well as from the seventh hell.  They are also
born from all other *tiryanca* except those with immeasurable lifespan, those in
the *antarvīpa*, and those in the *akarmabhūmi*. They are also born from all
other humans except those in the *akarmabhūmi*, those in the *antarvīpa*, and
those with immeasurable lifespan. They are also born from the *devaloka* up to
the *sahasrāra*.  Their lowest state is that of the *antarmahart* and their
highest state is that of the *pūrva koṭi*. They die both by *samavahata* and
*asamavahata* death. After death, they go to the seventh hell, all *tiryanca*,
all humans, and the *devaloka* up to the *sahasrāra*.  These beings are of four
*gati*, four *prāgati*, possess each body, and are innumerable.  This is the
description of aquatic creatures born from the womb.  **Discussion:**  The
*Prajñāpanā* instructs us to know the distinctions of aquatic creatures born
from the womb. These distinctions, such as fish, tortoise, etc., have been
explained in the discussion of the previous *sūtra*.  The description of
sufficient and insufficient should also be known as before. The body and other
aspects should be known as similar to those of aquatic creatures born from the
womb. The difference should be known as follows:  In the case of aquatic
creatures born from the womb, four bodies are found.

[94] The *Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra* states that these beings also possess a
*Vaikriya* body. Therefore, there are four bodies: *Audarika*, *Vaikriya*,
*Taijasa*, and *Karmana*.  _In the *Avagahana-Dvara*, the excellent *Avagahana*
of these womb-born aquatic beings should be known as a thousand *yojanas*. In
the *Sanhanana-Dvara*, all six *Sanhananas* are possible for these womb-born
aquatic beings. These six *Sanhananas* are: *Vajra-Rishabha-Naracha*, *Rishabha-
Naracha*, *Naracha*, *Ardha-Naracha*, *Kilika*, and *Sevarta*. Their explanation
has been given earlier in the context of the general explanation of the 23
*Dvaras*.  _In the *Sansthana-Dvara*, the *Sansthana* of the bodies of these
beings is possible in all six ways. These six *Sansthana* are: *Sama-Chaturasra-
Sansthana*, *Nyagrodha-Parimandala-Sansthana*, *Sadisa-Sansthana*, *Vamana-
Sansthana*, *Kubja-Sansthana*, and *Hunda-Sansthana*. Their explanation has been
given earlier in the context of the general explanation of the *Dvaras*. In the
*Lenya-Dvara*, all six *Leshyas* are possible. The *Shukla-Leshya* is also
possible. In the *Samudghata-Dvara*, there are five *Samudghatas* of the
beginning. The *Vaikriya-Samudghata* is also possible. In the *Sanji-Dvara*,
these beings are *Sanjnis*, not *Asanjnis*. In the *Veda-Dvara*, all three
*Vedas* are present. In addition to the *Napumsaka-Veda*, there is also the
*Stri-Veda* and the *Purusha-Veda*. In the *Paryapti-Dvara*, there are all six
*Paryaptis* and all six *Aparyaptis*. The *Vrittikara* has mentioned five
*Paryaptis* and five *Aparyaptis*. This should be understood in terms of the
oneness of language and mind. In the *Drishti-Dvara*, all three ( *Mithya-
Drishti*, *Samyak-Drishti*, and *Samya-Mithya-Drishti*) are present. In the
*Darsana-Dvara*, these beings can have three *Darsanas*, because some of them
may also have *Avadhi-Darsana*. In the *Jnana-Dvara*, these beings can also have
three *Jnanas*, because some of them may also have *Avadhi-Jnana*. In the
*Ajñana-Dvara*, these beings can also have three *Ajñanas*, because some of them
may also have *Vibhang-Jnana*. 1. *Vajra-Rishabha-Narayan* is the first, and
*Rishabha-Narayan* is the second. *Narayan*, *Ardha-Narayan*, *Kilika*, and
*Sevarta* are the last. // 1 // *Rishabha* is the *Patta*, but *Kilika* is the
*Muneyava*. *Uspa*, *Makkada-Bandha*, and *Narayan* are the *Viyanas*. // 2 //
2. There is also a reading of " *Sachi* ". The meaning of *Sachi* is the
*Shalmali* tree. It is well-nourished from the bottom, but not from the top. 3.
*Sama-Chaturasra*, *Nyagrodha-Mandala*, *Sai-Khujja-Bamanaya*, and *Hunda* are
the *Sansthana* of the *Jivas*. These are the *Muneyavas*. // 1 //

## First Classification: Description of Terrestrial Embryo-born Beings [95]
**[Regarding Right and Wrong Belief in Clairvoyance and Discernment]** There is
a difference between Right Belief and Wrong Belief in Clairvoyance and
Discernment. The Right-sighted have Clairvoyance, and the Wrong-sighted have the
same knowledge, which is called Discernment.  **[Regarding the Birthplace of
Terrestrial Embryo-born Beings]** These beings are born from the seven hells,
excluding the countless-year-lived Tiryanchas; from the remaining Tiryanchas,
excluding the Akarmabhoomi Antarvipaj and the countless-year-lived; from the
remaining humans of the Karmabhoomi, excluding the Akarmabhoomi Antarvipaj and
the countless-year-lived; and from the Devas up to the Sahasrar Devaloka. Devas
beyond this are not born among them.  **[Regarding the State of Terrestrial
Embryo-born Beings]** Their lowest state is Antarmuhurt, and their highest state
is Purvakoti.  **[Regarding the Progression of Terrestrial Embryo-born Beings]**
They go to all the realms of existence except the Devas beyond the Sahasrar
Devaloka.  **[Regarding the Movement and Progression of Terrestrial Embryo-born
Beings]** Therefore, they have four movements and four progressions. They are
each-bodied and countless.  **This is the description of aquatic embryo-born
beings. The description of terrestrial embryo-born beings is as follows:**
**[Regarding the Classification of Terrestrial Embryo-born Beings]** Terrestrial
embryo-born beings are classified into two types: those with two legs and those
with four legs.  **[Regarding the Classification of Four-legged Terrestrial
Embryo-born Beings]** Four-legged beings are classified into two types: those
with one hoof and those with a split hoof.  **[Regarding the Classification of
One-hoofed Terrestrial Embryo-born Beings]** One-hoofed beings are classified
into two types: those with a single hoof and those with a split hoof.
**[Regarding the Physical Characteristics of Terrestrial Embryo-born Beings]**
They have four bodies, and their size is measured in countless parts of an angul
(finger width). Their height is measured in three palis (a measure of length),
and they can reach up to the fourth earth.  **[Regarding the Movement and
Progression of Terrestrial Embryo-born Beings]** The rest is the same as for
aquatic embryo-born beings, with four movements, four progressions, and
countless in number.  **[Regarding the Classification of Terrestrial Embryo-born
Beings]** Terrestrial embryo-born beings are classified into two types: those
with a chest and those with a belly.  **[Regarding the Classification of Chest-
bodied Terrestrial Embryo-born Beings]** Chest-bodied beings are similar to the
Asaliyavajjo (a type of bird) and are described as having a body size measured
in countless parts of an angul (finger width). Their height is measured in
thousands of yojanas (a measure of distance), and their lifespan is measured in
Antarmuhurt. They can reach up to the fifth earth, and they are found among the
Tiryanchas, humans, and Devas up to the Sahasrar Devaloka.  **[Regarding the
Movement and Progression of Chest-bodied Terrestrial Embryo-born Beings]** The
rest is the same as for aquatic embryo-born beings, with four movements, four
progressions, and countless in number.  **[Regarding the Difference between
Right and Wrong Belief]** The Right-sighted have a different understanding than
the Wrong-sighted.  **[Regarding the Explanation]** ...

[96] From the Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra, what are the Bhuj-Parisarpas? The
distinction is as follows: There are four types of bodies, the Avagahana is from
the innumerable part of an angul to six kosas in the best case, the position is
from the Antarmuhurta to the Purvakoti in the best case. In the remaining
places, it is like the Ur-Parisarpas, going to the second hell. This is the
statement of the Bhuj-Parisarpas. With this, the statement of the Sthalacharas
is also complete.

## First Understanding: Description of Embryonic Aerial Beings [97 40]  What are
aerial beings? Aerial beings are of four types, such as *charmapkshi* (skin-
winged) etc., as described previously. Their *avagahana* (range of perception)
is from the smallest fraction of an *angula* (finger width) to *dhanupuhutta*
(bow-length) in the superior case. Their *sthiti* (duration of life) is from the
smallest fraction of an *antarmuhurta* (interval between two moments) to an
*asankhyeyabhaga* (incalculable part) of a *palyopam* (a measure of time) in the
superior case. The rest is like aquatic beings, as described previously.   Their
special characteristic is that these beings go up to the third hell. This is the
description of embryonic aerial beings, five-sensed, *tiryanch* (non-human) and
*tiyanch* (born from three yonis).   With this, the description of *tiyanch* is
complete.   ## Discussion [39-40]  These sutras instruct us to understand the
differences between terrestrial and aerial beings born from the womb, similar to
the differences between *sammuchhim* (non-embryonic) terrestrial and aerial
beings. In the *sammuchhim* terrestrial beings, the *prasalika* (a type of
serpent) is described in the category of *urparisarp* (serpents with a chest).
This should not be mentioned here because *prasalika* is *sammuchhim* and not
born from the womb.   Another difference is that in the sutra on *mahorag*
(great serpent), the phrase "**joyanasayamp*i *joyanasayapuhuttiya* vi
*joyanasahasamp*i" should be added. This means that the *avagahana* of
*sammuchhim* *mahorag* is *joyanaprithaktva* (a measure of distance) in the
superior case, while the *avagahana* of embryonic *mahorag* is
*joyanaprithaktva* and even a thousand *joyanas*.   In all other aspects, the
description is similar to embryonic aquatic beings, except for the *avagahana*,
*sthiti* and *udvartana* (rebirth).   The superior *avagahana* of quadrupeds is
six *kosas* (a measure of distance), the superior *sthiti* is three
*palyopamas*, and their *udvartana* is from the fourth hell to the *sahasrar*
(highest) heaven. This means that they can be reborn in all the realms between
these two points after death.   The superior *avagahana* of *urparisarp* is a
thousand *joyanas*, the superior *sthiti* is *purvakoti* (a measure of time),
and their *udvartana* is from the fifth hell to the *sahasrar* heaven. This
means that they can be reborn in all the realms between these two points after
death.   The superior *avagahana* of *bhujparisarp* (serpents with arms) is from
two to nine *kosas*, the superior *sthiti* is *purvakoti*, and their *udvartana*
is from the second hell to the *sahasrar* heaven. This means that they can be
reborn in all the realms between these two points after death.   The differences
between embryonic aerial beings, five-sensed, *tiryanch* are similar to
*sammuchhim* aerial beings. Their bodies and other aspects are similar to
embryonic aquatic beings, except for their *avagahana*, *sthiti* and
*udvartana*.   Embryonic aerial beings, five-sensed, *tiryanch*...

## 98] The **avagahana** (range of perception) of **tiryanch** (non-human
beings) is **dhanushprithaktva** (the distance a bow can be stretched) for the
best. The **jghanya** (lowest) is **angula** (finger) measure for all. The
**jghanya** state is also **antar mahatam** (innermost) for all, and their
**utkrista** (highest) state is an **asankhyatava** (innumerable) part of
**palyopam** (a measure of time). Their **udvartana** (progression) is from the
third hell to the **sahasrar** (thousandth) **devalok** (heavenly realm),
including all the living beings in between. This means they can be born in all
these living beings after death.  Some manuscripts contain two **sangrahani**
(collected) verses that describe **avagahana** and **sthiti** (state). Their
meaning is as follows:  The **utkrista avagahana** of **garbhavyutkrantik
jalachar** (aquatic beings born from eggs) is a thousand **yojan** (a measure of
distance), **chatuष्pad** (quadrupeds) is six **kos** (a measure of distance),
**urparisarp** (snakes) is a thousand **yojan**, **bhujparisarp** (lizards) is
**gavyuprithaktva** (the distance a cow can be stretched), and **pakshi**
(birds) is **dhanushprithaktva**.  The **utkrista sthiti** of **garbhajalachar**
is **purvakoti** (a measure of time), **chatuष्pad** is three **palyopam**,
**urparisarp** and **bhujparisarp** is **purvakoti**, and **pakshi** is an
**asankhyatava** part of **palyopam**.  There are two verses that describe the
**sthiti** of beings in hell. Their meaning is as follows:  **Asanji** (insects)
can go up to the first hell, **sarisarp** (reptiles) to the second, **pakshi**
to the third, **siha** (lion) to the fourth, **urga** (snake) to the fifth,
**striya** (women) to the sixth, and **matsya** (fish) and **manushya** (humans)
to the seventh.  Thus, the statement about **panchendriya tiryanch** (five-sense
non-human beings) is complete. Now, we will discuss humans.  The discussion
about humans starts from verse 41.  **41.  "What about humans? Humans are of two
types, those who are **samucchim** (worldly) and those who are **gambhavak**
(spiritual).**  **"Tell me, **bhnte** (venerable one), what do **samucchim**
humans do?"**  **"They are **samucchim** (worldly) because they are attached to
the world."**  **"Tell me, **bhnte**, how many **sariraga** (bodies) do living
beings have?"**  **"They have three **sariraga**, namely:**  **1.  **Yojan**
thousand **chhagga** (six) **auyayi** (a measure of time) and then **yojan**
thousand. **Gavyapuhutta** (the distance a cow can be stretched) for **bhujage**
(snakes) and **dhanushpuhuttam** (the distance a bow can be stretched) for
**pakshi** (birds).**  **2.  **Gambham** (hell) **purvakoti** (a measure of

## First Understanding: The Exposition of Humans [101]  There are three types of
vision found in humans. There are four types of philosophies. They are both
knowledgeable and ignorant.   Those who are knowledgeable are either two-
knowledgeable, three-knowledgeable, four-knowledgeable, or one-knowledgeable.
Those who are two-knowledgeable are, by rule, *matijnani* and *shrutajnani*.
Those who are three-knowledgeable are *matijnani*, *shrutajnani*, and
*avadhijnani* or *matijnani*, *shrutajnani*, and *manahparyavajnani*.   Those
who are four-knowledgeable are, by rule, *matijnani*, *shrutajnani*,
*avadhijnani*, and *manahparyavajnani*. Those who are one-knowledgeable are, by
rule, *kevalajnani*.   Similarly, those who are ignorant are either two-ignorant
or three-ignorant. They are also *manayogi*, *vachanayogi*, *kayayogi*, and
*ayogi*. They utilize both tangible and intangible forms. They consume food from
all six directions (in the form of *pudgala* absorption). They are born from all
hells except the seventh hell, from all *tiryanch* except those with an
immeasurable lifespan, from all humans except those born in *akarmabhumij*,
*antarvipaj*, and those with an immeasurable lifespan, and they are also born
from all gods. Their lowest state is *antarmuhurt* and their highest is three
*palya* in duration. They die from both *samavahat* and *asamavahat* death. They
are reborn in *nairyika* or in the *anuttaroppapatik* gods, or they attain
liberation, ending all suffering.  O Lord! How many *gati* and *pragati* do
these beings have?   O Gautama! They have five *gati* and four *pragati*. They
are both individual and numerous.   O Venerable Ascetic! This is the statement
about humans.   **Discussion:** When asked about humans, the Sutrakar says that
there are two types of humans: *sammuchim* humans and *garbhaja* humans.
Regarding *sammuchim* humans, the question is asked: Where are they born? Where
do they originate? In response to this question, the *Prajnapanasutra* is
referenced. That is, the answer should be known according to the
*Prajnapanasutra*. The *Prajnapanasutra* mentions this topic as follows: "In a
human realm that is forty-five lakh yojanas long and wide, containing two and a
half islands and seas, fifteen *karmabhumis*, thirty *akarmabhumis*, and fifty-
six *antarvipas*, *sammuchim* humans are born in the following: 1) *Uccara*
(excrement), 2) *Prasravan* (urine), 3) *Kaph* (phlegm), 4) *Singhan-nasika*
(nasal mucus), 5) *Vaman* (vomit), 6) *Pitt* (bile), 7) *Mavad* (pus), 8)
*Khoon* (blood), 9) *Veerya* (semen), 10) *Sukhe hue veerya ke pudgalon ka punah
gila hona* (re-moistening of dry semen particles), 11) *Mrit jeev ke kalevaron
mein* (in the corpses of dead beings), 12) *Stri-purush ke sangyog mein* (in the
union of men and women), 13) *Gavanagar ki gateron mein* (in the sewers of
villages and cities), and 14) *Sab prakar ke ashuci sthanon mein* (in all kinds
of unclean places). Their lifespan is as small as an immeasurable fraction of an
angul. They are *asangni*, *mithyadristi*, and lack all *paryaptis*. They die
after living only for *antarmuhurt*.

##  Translation:  **102** [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra] In this assembly of humans,
the characteristics of the body and other doors should be known as follows:
**Body Door:** These have three bodies: Praudarik, Taijas and Karman.
**Avagahana Door:** Their Avagahana is as small as an innumerable part of the
smallest and largest finger.  **Sanhanan, Sansthan, Kashaya, Lenya Door:** These
should be known like the two senses.  **Indriya Door:** These have five senses.
**Sanjid Door and Ved Door:** These should be known like the two senses.
**Paryapti Door:** It has five inadequacies. These are Labdhi-A-paryaptak.
**Darpti, Darshan, Gyan, Yog, Upayog Door:** These should be known like the
Earth-bodied beings.  **Pahar Door:** This is like the two senses.  **Upapat:**
These are born from the living beings except for the Devas, Tejas-Kaya, Vayu-
Kaya and those with an immeasurable lifespan.  **Sthiti:** These are born from
the Jayanya and Utkrishta and are as small as an Antarmuhurt. The Jghanya
Antarmuhurt is slightly larger than the Utkrishta Antarmuhurt. These die both in
Samavahat and Asamavahat.  **Udavartana:** These are born after death in all
living beings except for the Devas, Tejas-Kaya and those with an immeasurable
lifespan.  **Therefore, in the Gati-Pragati Door:** There are two types of Gati
and two types of Pragati (Tiryak and Manushya). These are each-bodied and
innumerable.  **O Ayushman Shraman!** This is the description of the assembly of
humans.  **Description of Garbha-J Manushya:** Humans born from the womb are of
three types: 1. Karma-Bhumik, 2. A-Karma-Bhumik and 3. Antardweep-J.  **Karma-
Bhumik:** Humans born in Karma-Pradhan lands are Karma-Bhumik. Where Karma is
predominant, like agriculture, commerce, or the practice of Moksha, that is
Karma-Bhumik. Five Bharat, five Airavat and five Maha-Videh - these are 15
Karma-Bhumis. In these lands, there are various businesses, professions,
agriculture, arts, etc. for livelihood. In these areas, there can be practices
and efforts for Moksha. Therefore, these are Karma-Bhumis. All social, political
and religious systems exist in these. Humans born in these are Karma-Bhumik
humans.  **A-Karma-Bhumik:** Where there is no Asi (weapons, etc.), Mashi
(literature, business, arts) and Krishi (agriculture), etc., and where there are
no efforts like Dharma-Aradhana for the practice of Moksha, such Bhog-Pradhan
lands are A-Karma-Bhumis. Five Haimvat, five Haranyavat, five Harivarsh, five
Ramyakavarsh, five Devakuru and five Uttar-Kuru - these are 30 A-Karma-Bhumis.
Humans born in these 30 A-Karma-Bhumis are A-Karma-Bhumik. The means of
enjoyment and consumption of these humans are fulfilled by Kalpa-Vrikshas, they
do not have to do any Karma for it. In the five Haimvat and five Haranyavat
regions, humans are one Kos tall, have a lifespan of one Palyopama, have Vajra-
Rishbhanaraach Sanhanan and Sama-Chaturasra Sansthan. Their back is...

## First Understanding: The Description of Humans  **[103 types of humans
exist]** They eat at intervals of one day and nurture their offspring for 79
days. In the five Hari Varsha and five Ramya Varsha regions, humans have a
lifespan of two Palyopamas and a height of two Kos. They have Vajra-Rishabha-
Naracha-Sanhanan (a specific type of head) and a square body structure. They
desire food at intervals of two days. They have 128 ribs.  **[64 types of humans
exist]** They nurture their offspring for 64 days. In the five Devakuru and five
Uttar Kuru regions, humans have a lifespan of three Palyopamas and a height of
three Kos. They have Bana-Rishabha-Naracha-Sanhanan (a specific type of head)
and a square body structure. They have 256 ribs, eat at intervals of three days,
and nurture their offspring for 49 days.  **[The term "Antar" means "middle"]**
The islands in the middle of the Salt Ocean are called Antarvipas. There are 56
Antarvipas. The humans living in these Antarvipas are called Antarvipaj.
**[Location of Antarvipas]** These Antarvipas are located on the projections of
the Himavan and Shikhari mountains that extend into the Salt Ocean. The Himavan
mountain, which marks the boundary of the Bharat Kshetra in Jambudvipa, extends
east-west into the Salt Ocean. Similarly, the Shikhari mountain, which marks the
boundary of the Airvat Kshetra, also extends east-west into the Salt Ocean. Each
end of these mountains is divided into two parts, resulting in two projections
extending into the Salt Ocean. These projections are called "Daadha" due to
their resemblance to elephant tusks. Each Daadha has seven regions inhabited by
humans. Thus, there are 847 = 56 Antarvipas. The humans living in these
Antarvipas are called Antarvipaj.  **[Four Islands in the Salt Ocean]** Three
hundred Yojanas away from the Himavan mountain, in the Salt Ocean, there are
four islands, each with a diameter of 300 Yojanas, located in the four
directions: 1. Ekosak, 2. Prabhasik, 3. Vaishanik, and 4. Langalik.  **[Four
More Islands]** Four hundred Yojanas further from these islands, there are four
more islands, each with a diameter of 400 Yojanas, located in the four
directions: 5. Hayakarna, 6. Gajakarna, 7. Gokarna, and 8. Shashkulokarn.
**[Four More Islands]** Five hundred Yojanas further from these islands, there
are four more islands, each with a diameter of 500 Yojanas, located in the four
directions: 9. Adarshamukh, 10. Medhamukh, 11. Ayomukh, and 12. Gomukh.  **[Four
More Islands]** Six hundred Yojanas further from these islands, there are four
more islands, each with a diameter of 600 Yojanas, located in the four
directions: 13. Hyamuk, 14. Gajamuk, 15. Harimukh, and 16. Vyaghamukh.  **[Four
More Islands]** Seven hundred Yojanas further from these islands, there are four
more islands, each with a diameter of 700 Yojanas, located in the four
directions: 17. Ashvakarna, 18. Singhakarna, 19. Akarn, and 20. Karnpravaran.
**[Four More Islands]** Eight hundred Yojanas further from these islands, there
are four more islands, each with a diameter of 800 Yojanas, located in the four
directions: 21. Ulkamukh, 22. Meghmukh, 23. Vidyutmukh, and 24. Amukh.  **[Four
More Islands]** Nine hundred Yojanas further from these islands, there are four
more islands, each with a diameter of 900 Yojanas, located in the four
directions: 25. Ghanadant, 26. Lashtdant, 27. Gudhdant, and 28. Shuddhadant.
**[Total Number of Islands]** All these 28 islands are located in Jambudvipa,
starting from the Jagati and extending 300 to 900 Yojanas away from the Himavan
mountain. Similarly, there are 28 islands with the same names located on the
projections of the Shikhari mountain, which marks the boundary of the Airvat
Kshetra. Thus, there are 56 Antarvipas in total, 28 on each side.  **[The
Lifespan of Antarvipaj]** The lifespan of the humans living in these Antarvipas
is one Palyopam...

[104] In the countless parts of the Jeevajeevaabhigamsutra Pam, there live
couples of humans with an age of a Yuga. In these islands, there is always a
structure like the third arrow. The men and women here are beautiful and
healthy. There are no diseases or disturbances. There is no master-servant
relationship. They have 64 ribs on their backs. Their food is taken after one
fourth of a Bhakt and consists of soil and flowers and fruits of the
Kalpvriksha. The earth there is sweeter than sugar and the fruits of the
Kalpvriksha are many times better than the food of a Chakravarti. The humans
here are gentle, soft and straight, devoid of attachment and hatred. The couples
here give birth to one couple (male and female) at the time of their death and
nurture them for 79 days. Their death occurs from yawning, coughing or sneezing,
not painfully. They die and go to the Devaloka. There are two types of humans in
the Karmabhoomi - Arya and Mlechchha (Anarya). The names of many types of
Mlechchhas like Shaka, Yavana, Kirata, Shabara, Barbar, etc. are mentioned in
the Prajnapanasutra. There are two types of Aryas - Riddhiprapt Arya and
Arddhiprapt Arya. Riddhiprapt Arya are of six types - 1. Arihant, 2.
Chakravarti, 3. Baldev, 4. Vasudev, 5. Charan and 6. Vidyadhar. Arddhiprapt Arya
are of nine types - 1. Kshetraarya, 2. Jatipraarya, 3. Kulmaarya, 4. Karmaarya,
5. Shilppaarya, 6. Bhashamaarya, 7. Gyaanarya, 8. Darshanarya and 9.
Charitramaarya. 1. Kshetraarya - Residents of 25 and a half countries are
Kshetraarya. In these regions, Tirthankaras, Chakravartis, Baldevs and Vasudevs
are born. 2. Jatiarya - Those whose maternal lineage is superior (acceptable to
the refined). 3. Kulaarya - Those whose paternal lineage is superior. Ugra,
Bhog, Rajanya, etc. are Kulaarya. 4. Karmaarya - Those who earn their livelihood
through refined business, etc. are Karmaarya. 5. Shilpaarya - Those who earn
their livelihood through refined arts are Shilpaarya. 6. Bhashaarya - Those who
use refined language and script are Bhashaarya. The Sutrakar has called those
who use Ardhamagadhi language and Brahmi script as Bhashaarya. By implication,
all languages and scripts are acceptable which are refined and have a soft and
beautiful vocabulary. 7. Gyaanarya - Five types of Gyaanarya should be
understood in relation to the five knowledges - Matigyaan, Shrutigyaan,
Avadhigyaan, Manahparyaygyaan and Kevalgyaan. 8. Darshanarya - Two types of
Darshanarya should be understood in relation to Saragdarshan and Vitragdarshan.
9. Charitramaarya - Two types of Charitramaarya should be known in relation to
Saragcharitra and Vitragcharitra. 1. Detailed information is given in the
Prajnapanasutra.

## First Understanding: The Description of Humans [105]  **Sragadarshan and
Sragacharitra** refer to the vision and conduct that exist as long as the
kshayas (passions) remain.   **Vitragadarshan and Vitragacharitra** refer to the
vision and conduct that arise with the pacification and weakening of the
kshayas.  **Akashaya** (passionless) **Yathakyatcharitra** (conduct according to
knowledge) is of two types: **Chhadyaasthik** and **Kaivalik**.  **Chhadyaasthik
Yathakyatcharitra** is found in the 11th and 12th Gunasthanas (stages of
spiritual progress), while **Kaivalik Yathakyatcharitra** is found in the 13th
and 14th Gunasthanas. Therefore, **Yathakyatcharitra-Arya** (noble ones) are of
two types.  This is a brief description of the **Prary-Manushya** (initial human
beings). For detailed information, one should read the **Prajnapanasutra**.
These humans are broadly classified into two types based on their **sufficiency
and insufficiency**, as described earlier.  **The 23 Doors of Humans:**  **Body
Door:** Humans possess all five types of bodies: **Audarik** (physical),
**Vaikriya** (subtle), **Aharak** (nutritive), **Taijas** (radiant), and
**Karman** (karmic). Their **Avagahana** (perception) ranges from an
**incalculable fraction of an angul** (finger width) to **three kos** (miles).
They possess all **six Sanhanan** (types of physical structure) and **six
Sansthan** (types of physical form).  **Kshaya Door:** They can be
**Krodhakashaya** (anger-prone), **Manakashaya** (pride-prone), **Mayakashaya**
(delusion-prone), **Lobhakashaya** (greed-prone), and **Akashaya** (passionless,
compared to a Vitrag manushya).  **Sanjna Door:** They can be **Charsanjna**
(four-knowledge) or **Nosanjna** (no-knowledge). **Vitrag manushya** are
**Nosanjna** in **Nischya** (absolute knowledge) and **Charitree** (conduct) in
**Vyavahar** (relative knowledge). They possess **ten types of Sanjna** due to
the attainment of **Lokottara Chitta** (supermundane mind).  **Lenya Door:**
They can possess **six Leshya** (types of karmic tendencies) or be **Aleshya**
(free from Leshya). **Param Shukladhyani Ayogikevali** (the perfect, white-
minded, non-liberated kevali) is **Aleshya**.  **Indriya Door:** They can be
**Upayukta** (suitable) in the use of **five Indriyas** (senses) or
**Noindriyopayukta** (not suitable, compared to a kevali).  **Samudghata Door:**
They possess all **seven Samudghata** (types of mental states).  **Sanji Door:**
They can be **Sanjna** (knowledgeable) or **Nosanjna-Noasanjna** (no-knowledge-
no-non-knowledge). They are **Nosanjna-Noasanjna** compared to a kevali.  **1.

[106] [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra] The Ved-Dwar (gateway of the Vedas) - all three
Vedas are found and there are also Avedi (non-Vedic). Those with subtle Sampraya
(subtle connection) and other Gunasthanas (stages of qualities) are Avedi. The
Paryapti-Dwar (gateway of perfection) - there are five Paryaptis (perfections)
and five Aparyaptis (imperfections). Five Paryaptis are mentioned due to the
expectation of considering language and Manas-Paryapti (mental perfection) as
one. The Drishti-Dwar (gateway of vision) - all three Drishtis (visions) are
found. Some are Mithyadrishti (false vision), some are Samyagdristi (right
vision), and some are Mishradrishti (mixed vision). / The Darshan-Dwar (gateway
of philosophy) - all four Darshanas (philosophies) are found. / The Jnana-Dwar
(gateway of knowledge) - humans are both Jnani (knowledgeable) and Ajnani
(ignorant). / Those who are Mithyadrishti are Ajnani, and those who are
Samyagdristi are Jnani. Among these, five Jnanas (knowledges) and three Ajnan
(ignorance) are mentioned. It is as follows: some humans have two Jnanas, some
have three Jnanas, some have four Jnanas, and some have one Jnana. / Those who
have two Jnanas are those with Matijnana (knowledge of perception) and
Shrutajnana (knowledge of scriptures) by rule. / Those who have three Jnanas are
those with Matijnana, Shrutajnana, and Avadhijnana (knowledge of clairvoyance)
or Matijnani, Shrutajnani, and Manas-Paryayajnani. Because even without
Avadhijnana, one can be Manas-Paryayajnani. This has been said in many places in
Siddha-Prabhut (perfect knowledge) etc. / Those who have four Jnanas are
Matijnani, Shrutajnani, Avadhijnana, and Manas-Paryayajnani. Those who have one
Jnana are Kevalajnani (omniscient). / When Kevalajnana is present, the remaining
four Jnanas disappear. It is said in Pagam that when Kevalajnana is present, the
Chhadmasthikajnana (knowledge of the veil) is destroyed. 'Only when Kevalajnana
is present, the remaining Jnanas are destroyed.' There may be doubt here as to
why the remaining Jnanas disappear when Kevalajnana arises? When these Mati etc.
Jnanas are present due to the partial destruction of their respective coverings,
then they should be present in greater quantity when their respective coverings
are completely destroyed, just like the Charitra-Parinam (results of conduct).
This is solved by the example of the emerald gem. Just as a high-quality emerald
gem, due to its inherent nature, is covered with dirt etc., until its dirt is
completely destroyed, a little bit of the gem is revealed when a little bit of
dirt is removed. It is of many types due to being Kwachit (sometimes), Kadachit
(perhaps), and Kathanchit (somehow). / Similarly, the Atma (soul) is naturally
endowed with the power to know all things, but this nature is hidden by the veil
of dirt. / Until the dirt is completely removed, the partial destruction of the
dirt leads to the partial manifestation of that nature. It can be of many types
due to being Kwachit, Kadachit, and Kathanchit. / It happens due to the
difference between Mati, Shruta etc. When the entire dirt of the emerald gem is
removed, the gem is manifested in one form. / Similarly, when all the coverings
of the Atma are removed, the partial knowledge is destroyed. 1. 'Nami U Chhauma

## First Understanding: Description of Devas [107]  "All knowledge (Kevalgyan)
is expressed in one form." Those who are ignorant are also those with two
ignorances and those with three ignorances. Those with two ignorances are those
who are ignorant of intellect (mati-agyani) and those who are ignorant of
scriptures (shruta-agyani). Those with three ignorances are those who are
ignorant of intellect (mati-agyani), those who are ignorant of scriptures
(shruta-agyani), and those who are ignorant of the nature of reality (vibhanga-
agyani).  Through the door of yoga, a human being is a mind yogi (manayogi), a
speech yogi (vacanayogi), a body yogi (kayayogi), and also an ayogi (non-yogi).
In the state of Shaileshi, there is ayogitva (non-yogic state). Through the door
of use (upayogadwar) and the door of food (aaharadwar), one should know like the
two senses. Through the door of rebirth (upapatadwar), birth can occur in humans
from all places except the seventh hell. There is no Nairyik manushya (human
being) in the seventh hell. The principle states that the seventh earth,
Nairyik, Tejaskaay, Vayukaay, and those with infinite years of life, do not
become human beings after countless years. Through the door of position
(sthiitidwar), humans are categorized into three types: inferior (jghanya),
intermediate (antarmuhurt), and superior (utkrusht). Through the door of
simultaneous death (samavahatadwar), humans die both with simultaneous death
(samavahat) and without simultaneous death (asamavahat). Through the door of
rebirth (udvartanaadwar), all beings are born in all hells, all animals, all
humans, and all non-returner devas (anuttaropapattik deva). Some become
liberated from all karmas and attain the state of Siddha-Buddha (perfect and
enlightened), achieving Nirvana and ending all suffering. Through the door of
movement and return (gati-agatidadwar), humans are those who go to five paths
(including Siddha-gati) and those who come from four paths. O venerable Shraman!
All these beings have bodies and are countless. The number of humans is
countless kotis (a unit of measurement). Thus, the description of humans is
complete.  ## Description of Devas [42]  "Who are the Devas?" Devas are
categorized into four types: Bhavanavasi, Vanamantara, Joisya, and Vemaaniya.
"Who are the Bhavanavasi?"   **Question:** When the covering of the soul
(aavaran) is removed, they go to the state of liberation (vijanta). How is it
that they do not become liberated when the covering of the soul (aavaran) is
removed?  **Answer:** Just as a gem, when its impurities are removed, reveals
its true form, so too, when the karmas of the soul are removed, its true nature
is revealed.

## First Understanding: Description of Devas [109]  **[Description of Devas]**
All those who are pleasing to the mind, they gather together in their bodily
form - they transform.  O Bhagavan! What is the institution of Devas?  Gautam!
There are two types of institutions: Bhavadharaniy and Uttarvaikriyik.  Of
these, the Bhavadharaniy is the Samachaturasrasthan, and the Uttarvaikriyik is
of various shapes.  Devas have four Kashayas, four Sanjnas, six Leshyas, five
Indriyas, and five Samudghatas.  They are both Sanjnee and Asanjnee.  They are
those with Strived, Purushaved, but not Napumsakaved.  They have five Paryaptis
and five Aparyaptis.  They have three Drishtis and three Darshanas.  They are
both Gyanee and Agnanee.  Those who are Gyanee are those with three Gyanas by
rule, and those who are Agnanee are those with three Agnanas by Bhajana.  Both
Sakar and Anakar are used in them.  They have all three Yogas.  Their food is to
consume the Pudgalas of all six directions by rule.  They usually eat Pudgalas
of yellow and white auspicious colors, with good fragrance, good taste, and good
touch.  They are born from Tiryanch and Manusyas.  Their lifespan is from the
lowest ten thousand years to the highest thirty-three Sagaropama.  They die both
by Samavahat and Asamavahat from the Maranantik Samudghatas.  They do not get
born in Naraka after leaving from there, they are born in Tiryanch and Manusyas
as much as possible, not in Devas.  Therefore, they are said to be of two
Gattis, two Pragatis, each Shariri, and countless.    O Ayushman Shraman! This
is the description of Devas.  Along with this, the description of Panchendriya
has been done, and along with that, the description of Udara Trasas is complete.
According to the Vivechan-Prajnapanasutra, one should know the different types
of Devas, which are as follows:  Devas are of four types: 1. Bhavanvaasi, 2.
Vanavyantar, 3. Jyotishk, and 4. Vaimanik.  **Bhavanvaasi:** Those Devas who
usually reside in Bhavanas are called Bhavanvaasi.  This should be understood in
comparison to Nagakumar etc.  Asurakumar usually reside in Avasas, and sometimes
also in Bhavanas.  Nagakumar etc. usually reside in Bhavanas, and sometimes also
in Avasas.    **[Difference between Bhavan and Avas]**  The Vrittikar has
written, clarifying the difference between Bhavan and Avas, that Bhavan is round
from the outside and square from the inside, and is shaped like the seed of a
lotus at the bottom.  Whereas Avas is a Mahamandap with a place of the size of
the body, which illuminates the directions with many Mani-ratnas.  There are ten
types of Bhavanvaasi Devas: 1. Asurakumar, 2. Nagakumar, 3. Suparnakumar, 4.
Vidhyutkumar, 5. Agnikumar, 6. Dweepkumar, 7. Uddikumar, 8. Dishakumar, 9.
Pavanakumar, and 10. Stanitkumar.    Each of these has two types: Paryapt and
Aparyapt.  These are like Kumaras, fond of adornment, playful, with intense
affection, and delicate, therefore they are called 'Kumar'.  **Vanavyantar:**
'Vi' means various types, 'Antar' means those who have shelter.  They are called
Vyantar because they reside in various places - Bhavan, Nagar, and Bhavas.

with a total of one hundred yojanas. These cities are also in the Tiryanch Lok,
and their inhabitants reside in all three lokas. / Alternatively, those who
dwell in various forests, mountain ranges, caves, and other shelters are known
as Vananyantara Devas. There are different categories of Vananyantara Devas:
Kinnara, Kimpurusha, Mahoraga, Gandharva, Yaksha, Rakshasa, Bhut, and Pichasha.
/ Each of these categories has two subcategories: Paryapta and Aparyapta. / /
Jyotishka - those who illuminate and enlighten the world are called Jyotishka,
meaning Vimanas. / Those who reside in these Jyotishka Vimanas are called
Jyotishka Devas. / Alternatively, those who are radiant with the signs of the
moon, sun, and other celestial bodies in their crowns are Jyotishka Devas. There
are five categories of these: Chandra, Surya, Graha, Nakshatra, and Tara. /
These also have two subcategories: Paryapta and Aparyapta. / Vaimanika - those
who reside in the Vimanas of the Urddhva Lok are called Vaimanika. They are of
two types: Kalpopanna and Kalpaatita. / Kalpopanna means where there are rules
and regulations of the Kalpa, i.e., where there are rules and practices of
Indra, Samanika, Trayastrish, etc., they are Kalpopanna. Where these practices
or rules do not exist, they are Kalpaatita. There are twelve categories of
Kalpopanna: 1. Saudharma, 2. Ishana, 3. Sanatkumara, 4. Mahendra, 5. Brahmalok,
6. Lant, 7. Mahashukra, 8. Sahasrar, 9. Anant, 10. Pranat, 11. Praran, and 12.
Achyut. / Each of these has two subcategories: Paryapta and Aparyapta. /
Kalpaatita Devas are of two types: Veyak and Anuttaroppapatika. / Veyak Devas
are of nine types: 1. Adhastan-Adhastat, 2. Adhastan-Madhyam, 3. Adhastan-
Uparim, 4. Madhyam-Adhastan, 5. Madhyam-Madhyam, 6. Madhyam-Uparim, 7. Uparim-
Adhastan, 8. Uparim-Madhyam, and 9. Uparim-Uparim. / These also have two
subcategories based on Paryapta and Aparyapta. Anuttaroppapatika Devas have five
categories: 1. Vijay, 2. Vaijayant, 3. Jayant, 4. Aparajit, and 5.
Sarvarthasiddha. / Each of these also has two subcategories: Paryapta and
Aparyapta. / The distinction between Paryapta and Aparyapta in Devas should not
be understood as arising from the Aparyapta Karma. Instead, it should be
understood at the time of their birth. / The Siddhanta states: "Naraka, Deva,
Garbhaja, Tiyanch, Manushya, and those with an immeasurable lifespan are
Aparyapta at the time of their birth." The following is a description of the
Devas' bodies and other 23 doors: Body Door - Devas have three bodies: Vaikriya,
Taijasa, and Karmana. / Avagahana Door - The Bhavadharaniy Avagahana is
immeasurable in terms of angulas from the lowest point and seven hands in length
from the highest point. The Uttaravaikriyiki is immeasurable in terms of angulas
from the lowest point and one lakh yojanas in length from the highest point. 2.

## First Understanding: Description of Devas [111]  **Sanhananadwar:** None of
the six Sanhanans exist because Sanhanan refers to the specific structure of
bones, and Devas have neither bones, veins, nor nerves. Therefore, they are
Asanhanani. However, the Pudgalas that are desirable, radiant, pleasing,
attractive, satisfying to the mind, soft, and charming, gather together in their
body form - they transform.  **Sansthanadwar:** The Bhavadharaniy Sansthan is
Samachauras Sansthan, and the Uttarvaikriya is of various types because they can
shape themselves according to their will.  **Kashayadwar:** They have all four
Kashayas.  **Sanjnaadwar:** They have all four Sanjnas.  **Leshyadwar:** They
have all six Leshyas.  **Indriyadwar:** They have all five Indriyas.
**Samudghtadwar:** They have five Samudghatas: Vaikriya, Kashay, Maranantik,
Vaikriya, and Tejas Samudghatas.  **Sanjidwar:** They are both Sanji and Asanji.
Those who become Devas after dying from Garbhavyutkrantik are Sanji, and those
who are born from Sammuchhimas are called Asanji.  **Devadwar:** They are
Strivedi and Puvedi. They do not have Napunsakavedi.  **Paryapti, Drishti, and
Darshanadwar:** Like Nairyayikas.  **Gyanadwar:** They are both Gyanis and
Agnyanis. Those who are Gyanis have three types of knowledge: Mati, Shruta, and
Avadhi. Those who are Agnyanis have either two or three types of ignorance.
Those with three types of ignorance have Mati-pragyan, Shruta-agnyan, and
Vibhanggyan. Those with two types of ignorance have Mati-agnyan and Shruta-
pragyan. Those who are born from Asanjis have two types of ignorance. This is
the meaning of Bhajana.  **Upayog and Aharadwar:** Should be understood like
Nairyayikas. They use both Sakar and Anakar. They consume food from all six
directions.  **Upapatadwar:** They are born from Sanji Panchendriya, Asanji
Panchendriya, Tiryanch, and Garbhaja humans, but not from other living beings.
**Sthitidwar:** Their lowest lifespan is ten thousand years, and their highest
lifespan is thirty-three Sagaropama.  **Samavahatadwar:** They die both with and
without Maranantik Samudghata.  **Chyavanadwar:** When these Devas die, they are
reborn in Earth, water, plant bodies, Garbhaja, and Tiryanch Panchendriya with a
lifespan of Sankhyat years, and in humans. They do not go to other living
beings.  **Gati-Agatiadwar:** Therefore, they are those who go in two motions
and come in two motions.

[112]  "O Venerable Ascetic! These Devas are all embodied and are countless.
Thus is the description of Devas. With this, the description of the five senses
is complete, and the statement of the generous abodes is also complete.    In
the next Sutra, the Sutrakar describes the state of being of the stationary and
the mobile, saying:  "Venerable! How long is the state of being of the
stationary?" "Gautama! From the least to the end of a muhurta, and from the best
to twenty-two thousand years." "Venerable! How long is the state of being of the
mobile?" "Gautama! From the least to the end of a muhurta, and from the best to
thirty-three sagaropamas." "Venerable! How long can a stationary being remain
stationary?" "Gautama! From the least to the end of a muhurta, and from the best
to an infinite time - infinite Utsarpini and Avasarpini times. There are
infinite worlds, countless Puggalaparitatta." "Venerable! How long is the state
of being of the mobile?" "Gautama! From the least to the end of a muhurta, and
from the best to an infinite time - infinite Utsarpini and Avasarpini times.
There are countless worlds." "Venerable! How long is the difference between the
stationary and the mobile?" "Just as the accumulation of the mobile."
"Venerable! How long is the difference between the mobile and the stationary?"
"Gautama! From the least to the end of a muhurta, and from the best to the time
of the Vanaspati." "Venerable! Are these stationary beings, some small, some
large, some equal, some different?" "Gautama! They are all the same, the
stationary beings are infinite in number." "Thus, these two types of beings are
called Samsara-Samavannagha Jivas." "They are considered to be of two types."

## First Understanding: Explanation of Existence  **[113 Avasarpini's / From the
field to infinite Lokas, to countless Pudgalparavart / In the countless parts of
Pravalika, as many Pudgalparavart as there are times, a stationary being can
remain in the stationary form.  Bante! How long can a being remain in this form?
Gautam! From the lowest to Antarmuhurt and from the highest to countless
Utsarpini-Pravpinis / From the field to countless Lokas / Bhagavan! What is the
difference in stationary beings?  Gautam! As much as their accumulation time is,
that is, countless Utsarpini-Avasarpini times; from the field to countless Lokas
/ Bhagavan! What is the difference in "S"?  Gautam! From the lowest to
Antarmuhurt and from the highest to the time of plants / Bhagavan! Among these
"Basas" and stationary beings, who is less, more, equal or privileged?  Gautam!
The "Trasas" are the least / Stationary beings are infinitely more than them.
This is the description of these two types of worldly beings. This two-fold
understanding, called the first understanding, is complete.  Discussion - In
this sutra, the existence, body-existence, difference and less-more-ness of
"Prasas" and stationary beings have been explained. The existence of stationary
beings is said to be from the lowest to Antarmuhurt and from the highest to a
thousand years of "Bavo". This situation should be understood by taking the
earth-body, because such a high existence is not possible for other stationary
bodies. The lowest existence of "Trasas" is said to be Antarmuhurt and the
highest is thirty-three "Sagaropama". This should be understood in relation to
Devas and Narakas / Other "Trasas" do not have such a high existence. The
meaning of body-existence is the calculation of those existences when one is
born again and again in the same body / For example, all the time that a
stationary-bodied being is born as a stationary being, that should be understood
as its body-existence. How much is the body-existence of a stationary being?
This means how long does a stationary being continuously take birth as a
stationary being. In answering this question, it is said that from the lowest to
Antarmuhurt and from the highest to infinite time, a stationary being continues
to take birth and death as a stationary being / This infinite time has been
explained in relation to time and field. From the point of view of time, a
stationary being can remain as a stationary being for infinite Utsarpini and
Avasarpini times. From the point of view of the field, this infinity is
explained as follows: in infinite Lokas, as many sky-regions as there are, if
one takes away one at a time, the time it takes is infinite Avasarpini-Utsarpini
time. Explaining this infinity in terms of Pudgalparavart, it is said that in
countless Pudgalparavart (field Pudgalparavart), as many Utsarpini's...**

[114] The **Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra** states that **Avapiniyas** can remain in
the form of a **sthavara** for as many **Ananta Avasarpinis-Utsarpinis** as
there are **Pudgalapravartas**. It is explained that one should know as many
**Pudgalapravartas** as there are moments in an **Asankhyeya** part of a
**Pravalika**. This duration should be understood in relation to the
**Vanaspatikaaya**, not the **Prithvikaaya-Apkaaya**. Because the **Prithvikaaya
Apkaaya**'s excellent **kaayasthiti** is evidence of **Asankhyeya Utsarpinis-
Avasarpinis**. This is clarified in the **Prajnapanasutra**. This
**Vanaspatikaayasthiti** duration should be understood in relation to
**Saanvyavaharik** beings. The **kaayasthiti** of **Asaanvyavaharik** beings
should be understood as **Anadi**. As stated in the **Visheshnavati** text:
"There are infinite beings who have not attained **Trasattva**. Those who reside
in **Nigoda** are **Anantananta**. The **kaayasthiti** of some beings with
**Asanvyavahar** **rashi** is **Anadi-Ananta**, meaning they will never leave
the **Asanvyavahar** **rashi** and enter the **Vyavahar** **rashi**. Some beings
with **Asanvyavahar** **rashi** have a **kaayasthiti** that is **Anadi** but has
an end, meaning they can enter the **Vyavahar** **rashi**. As **Jinabhadragani
Kshamasraman** stated in the **Visheshnavati**: "As many beings attain
**Siddha** from the **Vyavahar** **rashi**, so many beings enter the
**Vyavahar** **rashi** from the **Anadi Vanaspati** **rashi**.  The question of
how long a **Trasajiva** can remain in the **Sarup** form is answered: from the
**Jghanya** to **Antarmuhurta**, and from the **Utkrisht** to **Asankhyeya**
time. This **Asankhyeya** time is explained in terms of **Kala** and
**Kshetra**. In terms of **Kala**, it is as many **Utsarpinis-Avasarpinis** as
there are **Asankhyeya**. In terms of **Kshetra**, it is as many **Utsarpinis-
Avasarpinis** as it takes to subtract one **Akashapradesha** from each of the
**Asankhyeya** **lokas**. A **Trasajiva** can remain in the **Tras** form for
that duration. This **kaayasthiti** is only possible in relation to **Gatis-
Tejaskaya** and **Vayukaya**, not **Labdhitas**. The **kaayasthiti** of
**Labdhitas** is only a few years more than two thousand **Sagaropama** at its
peak.  After an **Antar-Sthavara** being abandons its **Sthavaratva**, how long
will it take for it to become a **Sthavara** again? The answer is: **Asankhyeya
Utsarpinis-Avasarpinis** in terms of **Kala**, and the difference of
**Asankhyeya** **lokas** in terms of **Kshetra**. This difference is possible in
relation to **Tejaskaya** and **Vayukaya**, not in relation to other **kaayas**.
After a being abandons its **Sakaya** **Sattva**, how long will it take for it

[115 First Understanding: Exposition of the State of Existence] Clarity has been
established above. This difference is possible only when entering the plant
body, not otherwise. In the category of the very few, the smallest number of
living beings are the Trasas, because they are innumerable. The stationary
beings are infinitely greater than them, because they are infinitely numerous,
surpassing even the Trasas. Thus, the exposition of the two types of worldly
living beings has been described. This is the exposition of the first
understanding, which is in the form of the understanding of these two types of
living beings. // First Understanding Complete.

The second understanding, known as Trividha, is discussed. In the first
understanding, two types of beings who end the cycle of rebirth were explained.
Now, in the second understanding, which comes in order, three types of beings
who end the cycle of rebirth are to be explained. Therefore, the second
understanding, called Trividha, is begun, and its initial sutra is: "There are
three types of beings who end the cycle of rebirth." [44] Those who say that
there are three types of beings who end the cycle of rebirth, say that there are
three types of beings who end the cycle of rebirth: 1) female, 2) male, and 3)
neuter. [44] (Out of the previously mentioned nine understandings)
**Explanation:** In the first understanding, two types of beings who end the
cycle of rebirth, namely As and Sthavar, were described and their detailed
explanation was given through 23 doors. Now, in this second understanding, it is
intended to describe three types of beings who end the cycle of rebirth. It has
been said that there are nine understandings regarding the beings who end the
cycle of rebirth, based on differences in interpretation. All these
understandings, though different in form, are non-contradictory and true.
Despite the differences due to differences in interpretation, all these
understandings actually present different aspects of the true reality. Those who
describe the three types of beings who end the cycle of rebirth, say that there
are three types of beings who end the cycle of rebirth: 1) female, 2) male, and
3) neuter.  This distinction is made based on Veda. When worldly beings are
described from the perspective of Veda, they are divided into three categories.
All types of worldly beings are included in these three categories from the
perspective of Veda. That is, all worldly beings are either those with female
Veda, male Veda, or neuter Veda. They are not without Veda. The meaning of Veda
is: desire for union. Veda arises from the emergence of non-destructive, non-
delusive karma. Female Veda: The karma whose emergence leads to the desire to
unite with a male is called female Veda. The external sign of female Veda is the
womb, breasts, etc. Women are predominantly soft, therefore, they have a greater
desire for softness than for hardness. The affliction of female Veda is like the
fire of cow dung (Kariṣāgni), which neither appears quickly nor subsides
quickly. From a practical (gross) perspective...

Second Pratipatti: Description of Women [117 The seven characteristics of
femininity are considered to be - 1. Yoni (vagina), 2. Softness, 3. Instability,
4. Innocence, 5. Weakness, 6. Breasts, and 7. Desire for Purusha (sexual desire
for men).]  Purushavedha - The karma whose arising leads to the desire to engage
in sexual activity with a woman is called Purushavedha. The external signs of
Purushavedha are the male organ, moustache, beard, etc. Predominance of the
harsh element is found in the male, hence he requires the soft element.  The
vitiating effect of Purushavedha is like the fire of a straw, which flares up
quickly and is also quickly extinguished.  The seven characteristics of the male
are said to be - 1. Penis, 2. Hardness, 3. Firmness, 4. Valor, 5. Moustache and
beard, 6. Steadfastness, and 7. Desire for women.  Napumsakavedha - The karma
whose arising leads to the desire to engage in sexual activity with both women
and men is called Napumsakavedha. In the Napumsaka, there is a mixture of
feminine and masculine traits. The sexual desire of the Napumsaka is like a city
conflagration or a forest fire, which takes a long time to be extinguished. In
the Napumsaka, there is a combination of the signs of both women and men.  Since
the Napumsaka has a mixture of softness and hardness, they have the need for
both, women and men. The Naraka beings are only those with Napumsakavedha. From
the single-sensed beings to the four-sensed beings and the non-sentient five-
sensed beings, all are those with Napumsakavedha. All the Samucchinna beings are
Napumsakavedhi. In the womb-born animals and womb-born humans, all three Vedas
are found. Among the devas, only Striveda and Purushavedha exist, Napumsakavedha
does not exist. All the worldly beings are encompassed in the above-mentioned
three Vedas. In the state of subsidence of Vedamohaniya, its existence alone
remains, the arising does not remain. When the Veda is completely destroyed, the
state of Avediya is attained.  Description of Women 45. [1] What are the types
of women? Women are classified into three types, namely - 1. Tiryañcayoni-
sthitiya (animal-wombed), 2. Manushya-sthitiya (human-wombed), 3. Deva-sthitiya
(divine-wombed).  What are the Tiryañcayoni-sthitiya (animal-wombed) women? The
Tiryañcayoni-sthitiya women are classified into three types, namely - 1.
Jalachari (aquatic), 2. Sthalachari (terrestrial), 3. Sahachari (co-habitant).
1. Yoni, softness, instability, innocence, weakness, breasts, and desire for
Purusha - these seven are the characteristics of femininity.  2. Penis,
hardness, firmness, valor, moustache and beard, steadfastness, and desire for
women - these seven are the characteristics of masculinity.  3. The wise declare
the Napumsaka as one possessing a combination of the traits and absence of
traits of both breasts and moustache/beard, and whose sexual desire is like a
raging fire of delusion.

Devithiyao**, **Nakshatra-Viman-Jyotishka-Devithiyao**, **Tara-Viman-Jyotishka-
Devithiyao**. These are the **Jyotishka-Devithiyao**. What are the **Vimanika-
Devithiyao**? **Vimanika-Devithiyao** are of two types, namely **Soudharma-
Kalpa-Vimanika-Devithiyao** and **Isana-Kalpa-Vimanika-Devithiyao**. These are
the **Vimanika-Devithiyao**.  [3] How many types of **Devithiyao** are there?
There are four types of **Devithiyao**. Namely, 1. **Bhavana-Pati-Devithiyao**,
2. **Vana-Vyantara-Devithiyao**, 3. **Jyotishka-Devithiyao**, and 4. **Vimanika-
Devithiyao**.  How many types of **Bhavana-Pati-Devithiyao** are there?
**Bhavana-Pati-Devithiyao** are of ten types. Namely, **Asura-Kumar-Bhavana-
Vasi-Devithiyao** up to **Stanita-Kumar-Bhavana-Vasi-Devithiyao**. This is the
description of **Bhavana-Vasi-Devithiyao**.  How many types of **Vana-Vyantara-
Devithiyao** are there? **Vana-Vyantara-Devithiyao** are of eight types. Namely,
**Pishacha-Vana-Vyantara-Devithiyao** up to **Gandharva-Vana-Vyantara-
Devithiyao**. This is the description of **Vana-Vyantara-Devithiyao**.  How many
types of **Jyotishka-Devithiyao** are there? **Jyotishka-Devithiyao** are of
five types. Namely, **Chandraviman-Jyotishka-Devithiyao**, **Surya-Viman-
Jyotishka-Devithiyao**, **Graha-Viman-Jyotishka-Devithiyao**, **Nakshatra-Viman-
Jyotishka-Devithiyao**, and **Tara-Viman-Jyotishka-Devithiyao**. This is the
description of **Jyotishka-Devithiyao**.  How many types of **Vimanika-
Devithiyao** are there? **Vimanika-Devithiyao** are of two types. Namely,
**Soudharma-Kalpa-Vimanika-Devithiyao** and **Isana-Kalpa-Vimanika-Devithiyao**.
This is the description of **Vimanika-Devithiyao**.  **Discussion:** This sutra
describes women. There are no women in the **Naraka-Gati** (hell realm) because
only those with **Napumsaka-Veda** (non-gendered) are in **Naraka**. Therefore,
women are present in the remaining three realms - **Tiyanga**, **Manushya**, and
**Deva-Gati**. Hence, the sutra states that there are three types of women -
**Tiyanga-Stri**, **Manushya-Stri**, and **Deva-Stri**. In the **Tiyanga-Gati**,
there are women from **Eka-Indriya** (one sense) to **Chatur-Indriya** (four
senses) and **Asanjna-Panchendriya** (unconscious five senses).

## 122] Those who are born with the [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra] and [Sammuchhim]
are eunuchs. Therefore, there are women among the [Garbha-jatiya], [Garbha-
manushya], and [Devas]. Hence, three types of women have been mentioned. There
are three divisions of [Tiryach] women: [Jalachari], [Thalachari], and
[Khechari]. According to the sub-divisions of [Tiryach], one should know the
divisions of their women. Similarly, there are [Karma-bhumika], [Akarma-
bhumika], and [Antar-dvipika] divisions of human women. According to the sub-
divisions of humans, one should understand the divisions of their women. For
example, one should understand the 15 divisions of [Karma-bhumika] women, 30
divisions of [Akarma-bhumika] women, and 28 divisions of [Antar-dvipika] women.
According to the divisions of [Bhavana-pati], [Vana-vyantar], and [Jyotishka]
Devas, one should understand the divisions of their women. Among the [Vaimanika]
Devas, there are women only in the first [Saudharm] Devaloka and the second
[Ishan] Devaloka. There are no women in the Devalokas beyond these. Therefore,
two divisions of [Vaimanika] Devis have been mentioned: [Saudharm-kalpa
Vaimanika Deva-stri] and [Ishan-kalpa Vaimanika Deva-stri]. In this way, the
three divisions of women have been described.  ## 46] The [Bhavasthiti] of women
has been explained.  **Itthiinam bhanta! Kevaiyan kaalam thiti panatta?**
**Goayama! Egenam ayesenam jahannenam antomuhutta ukkoesenam panapannam
paliovamai.** **Ekkhenam ayesenam jahannenam antomuhutta, ukkoesenam nava
paligrovamai.** **Ekkhenam ayesenam jahannenam antomuhutta ukkoesenam satta
paliovamai.** **Ekkhenam ayesenam jahannenam antomuhutta ufkosenam pannasam
paliovamai.**  **[46] O Bhagavan! How long is the [Bhavasthiti] of women said to
be?** **Gautama! From one perspective, the lowest [Bhavasthiti] is
[Antarmuhurta] and the highest is [Panchapan Paliopama].** **From another
perspective, the lowest [Bhavasthiti] is [Antarmuhurta] and the highest is [Nava
Paliopama].** **From a third perspective, the lowest [Bhavasthiti] is
[Antarmuhurta] and the highest is [Satta Paliopama].** **From a fourth
perspective, the lowest [Bhavasthiti] is [Antarmuhurta] and the highest is
[Panchasam Paliopama].**  **Discussion:** This Sutra generally explains the
[Bhavasthiti] of women. Collectively, the [Bhavasthiti] of women is explained
here from four perspectives. The word "Aadesa" used in the Sutra is a word for
"type". The word "prakar" is also a word for "perspective". These four "Aadesa"
(types) are as follows: (1) From one perspective, the [Bhavasthiti] of women is
the lowest [Antarmuhurta]. This should be understood in relation to [Tiryach]
and human women. There is no such low [Bhavasthiti] elsewhere. The highest
[Bhavasthiti] is [Panchapan Paliopama]. This should be understood in relation to
the [Ishan-kalpa] [Aparigrihita] Devi. (2) From another perspective, the lowest
[Bhavasthiti] is [Antarmuhurta] (as before) and the highest is [Nava Paliopama].
This should be understood in relation to the [Ishan-kalpa] [Parigrihita] Devi.
(3) From a third perspective, the lowest [Bhavasthiti] is [Antarmuhurta] (as
before) and the highest is [Satta Paliopama]. This is in relation to the
[Saudharm-kalpa] [Parigrihita] Devi. 1. "Aadeso tti pagarom" iti vachanat.

## Second Rebirth: The Condition of Human Women  [123 (4) Inferior to the fourth
expectation, the Antarmukhurta (as before) and superior to fifty Palyopama /
This is in comparison to the unclaimed Goddess of the Saudharma Kalpa.] The
separate existence of the Tiryachchstri etc. 47. [1] "Bhagavan! How long is the
condition of the Tiryakyonisthri said to be?" "Gautama! The inferior is
Antarmukhurta and the superior is three Palyopama." "Bhagavan! How long is the
condition of the Jalachar Tiryakyonisthri said to be?" "Gautama! The inferior is

the Uragparisarp Thalachar Tiryakyonisthri said to be?" "Gautama! The inferior
is Antarmukhurta and the superior is Purvakoti." "In the same way, the condition
of the Bhujparisarp Tiryakyonisthri is to be understood / In the same way, the
condition of the Khacharyakyonisthri is Antarmukhurta and the superior is an
innumerable part of Palyopama." [47] (1) "Bhagavan! How long is the condition of
the Manushyasthri said to be?" "Gautama! The inferior is Antarmukhurta and the
superior is three Palyopama, when the field is cultivated. When Dharmacharan is
cultivated, the inferior is Antarmukhurta and the superior is Purvakoti of

taken together is Palyopama, with the superior being seven, nine, and one, and

## Second Discourse: The State of Devī-Strīs  **[125]** **Bhagavan!** What is
the state of human women in the karmbhūmi of the Bharat and Eravata regions?
**Gautama!** In terms of the region, their state is inferior to the antarmūhūrta
and superior to three palyopama. In terms of the charitradharma, their state is
inferior to the antarmūhūrta and superior to the desonapūrva-koṭi.  **Bhanta!**
What is the state of human women in the karmbhūmi of the Pūrva-Videha and
Paścima-Videha? **Gautama!** In terms of the region, their state is inferior to
the antarmūhūrta and superior to the pūrva-koṭi. In terms of the charitradharma,
their state is inferior to the antarmūhūrta and superior to the desonapūrva-
koṭi.  **Bhanta!** What is the state of human women in the akarmabhūmi?
**Gautama!** In terms of birth, their state is inferior to slightly less than
one palyopama. By slightly less, it should be understood as less than an
innumerable part of a palyopama. Their state is superior to three palyopama. In
terms of saṃharaṇa, their state is inferior to the antarmūhūrta and superior to
the desonapūrva-koṭi.  The state of human women in the Hemavat-Airayanvat region
is inferior to one palyopama less than an innumerable part of a palyopama in
terms of birth, and inferior to the antarmūhūrta and superior to the
desonapūrva-koṭi in terms of saṃharaṇa.  **Bhanta!** What is the state of human
women in the akarmabhūmi of the Harivarṣa-Ramyakavarṣa? **Gautama!** In terms of
birth, their state is inferior to two palyopama less than an innumerable part of
a palyopama, and superior to two palyopama. In terms of saṃharaṇa, their state
is inferior to the antarmūhūrta and superior to the desonapūrva-koṭi.

women in the akarmabhūmi of the Antaradvipas? **Gautama!** In terms of birth,
their state is inferior to an innumerable part of a palyopama. Here, deson means
an innumerable part of a palyopama. In other words, their inferior state is an
innumerable part of a palyopama less than an innumerable part of a palyopama,
and their superior state is an innumerable part of a palyopama. In terms of
saṃharaṇa, their state is inferior to the antarmūhūrta and superior to the
desonapūrva-koṭi.  **The State of Devī-Strīs [3]**  **Bhanta!** For how long
does this state remain? **Gotama!** It remains for ten thousand years,

## Second Chapter: The State of Devistris  **127. The state of Chandravimaan-
Jyotishkdevistris:** Their lowest state is one-fourth of a Palyopam, and their
highest state is fifty thousand years more than half a Palyopam.  **The state of
Suryavimaan-Jyotishkdevistris:** Their lowest state is one-fourth of a Palyopam,
and their highest state is five hundred years more than half a Palyopam.  **The
state of Grahavimaan-Jyotishkdevistris:** Their lowest state is one-fourth of a
Palyopam, and their highest state is half a Palyopam.  **The state of
Nakshatravimaan-Jyotishkdevistris:** Their lowest state is one-fourth of a
Palyopam, and their highest state is slightly more than a quarter of a Palyopam.
**The state of Taravimaan-Jyotishkdevistris:** Their lowest state is one-eighth
of a Palyopam, and their highest state is slightly more than one-eighth of a
Palyopam.  **The state of Vaimanikdevistris:** Their lowest state is one
Palyopam, and their highest state is fifty-five Palyopams.  **Bhagavan! What is
the state of Vaimanikdevistris in the Saudharma Kalpa?**  **Gautam!** Their
lowest state is one Palyopam, and their highest state is seven Palyopams.  **The
state of Vaimanikdevistris in the Ishana Kalpa:** Their lowest state is slightly
more than one Palyopam, and their highest state is nine Palyopams.
**Discussion:** This sutra explains the time duration of Tiryanchistris,
Manushyastis, and Devistris in a technical and separate manner.  Firstly, the
highest state of Tiryanchistris is explained. There are two types of states:
lowest and highest. The lowest state means staying for the shortest duration,
and the highest state means staying for the longest duration. The lowest state
of Tiryanchistris is Antarmuhurt, and the highest state is three Palyopams. This
highest state is in comparison to the Chatushpadastri in Devakuru, etc. In a
specific context, the highest state of Jalcharastris is Purvakoti, the highest
state of Sthalcharastris is Audhik (three Palyopams), and the highest state of
Khecharastris is an innumerable part of a Palyopam. (The highest state of
Urparisarp and Bhujparisarp is Purvakoti.) The lowest state for all is
Antarmuhurt.  **The state of Manushyastis:** The state of Manushyastis is
explained in two ways: one based on the region and the other based on
Dharmacharan (character).  **The technical state of Manushyastis based on the
region:** Their lowest state is Antarmuhurt, and their highest state is three
Palyopams. This highest state is in comparison to the period of Ekant Sushma,
etc., in Devakuru, etc., and in Bharat, etc.  **The state of Manushyastis based
on Dharmacharan (character):** Their lowest state is Antarmuhurt, and their
highest state is Deshonpurvakoti.

The statement that the lowest state of a woman's character is a moment
(antarmuhurt) is to be understood in relation to the possibility of falling from
character due to a change in the stream of consequences in the same life. At
least for the duration of an antarmuhurt, character remains. If a woman, due to
the cessation of the karmic force (kshayopasham), accepts the character of
complete renunciation (sarvavirati) and then, within at least an antarmuhurt,
due to a change in the stream of consequences, falls from this character and
becomes a non-renouncer (avirata) with right faith (samyagdristi) or falls into
the state of false belief (mithyatvagunasthan), then, from this perspective, the
lowest state of character is for the duration of an antarmuhurt. Or, even if
death occurs after accepting character, the possibility of an antarmuhurt in the
state of non-negligent restraint (aprammatasanyatagunasthan) is also consistent
from another perspective.  Here, by practice of religion (dharmacharan), one
should understand renunciation of the world (deshaviriti), not complete
renunciation (sarvavirati). Renunciation of the world is also only for an
antarmuhurt, even from the lowest state, because there are many types of
renunciation of the world.  One might question why, even with the possibility of
both types of character, only renunciation of the world is accepted. The answer
is that complete renunciation is usually preceded by renunciation of the world,
and this is why it is accepted. The elder teachers have said that "after
attaining right faith (samyaktva), the attainment of the state of a lay follower
(shravakatva) and the cessation or destruction of the karmic force that obscures
character (charitramohaniya) occur after a period of time equal to a moment
(palyopam) or a moment (prithaktva), which is like a number of oceans
(sagaropama)."  The highest state of character is said to be the state of the
first koti (deshonpurvakoti). Before the age of eight years, there are no
consequences of character. After the age of eight years, if one accepts
character and maintains it without falling from it until the last antarmuhurt of
the first koti, then it is said to be the highest state of character. By
reducing the duration of the period to eight years, the state of women is
described in relation to the highest state of character. The first koti refers
to one crore (one hundred million) previous lives. The measure of a previous
life is as follows: one previous life is equal to 70,560,000,000,000 years
(70,56000,0000000 = seventy trillion, fifty-six billion).  After describing the
highest state of women, the statement is made about the special state of women
in the realm of karma (karmabhumik). The state of women in the realm of karma is
from the lowest state to an antarmuhurt and from the highest state to three
moments (palyopam).  This should be understood in the realm of Bharat and
Airāvata, in the beginning (prarak) called Sushama-Sushama. In relation to
character, the lowest state is an antarmuhurt and the highest state is the first
koti (deshonpurvakoti). This statement is made about the general characteristics
of the realm of karma. The special statement is as follows: in Bharat and
Airāvata, the state of three moments (palyopam) occurs in the realm of Sushama-
Sushama. In the eastern and western Videhas, the state of one moment (palyopam)
is attained in the realm, and the number of oceans (sagar) is equal to the
number of steps (charanovsamakhyanam).  1. When one moment (palyopam) is
attained, the lay follower (savatro) is born. The number of oceans (sagar) is
equal to the number of steps (charanovsamakhyanam).  2. The measure of a
previous life (puvvasa) is indeed one hundred million (kodilakhayo). One should
know that there are fifty-six thousand (chhappannang cha sahasaa) previous lives
(vasakodi).

## Second Proposition: The State of Devstriyas  [There are 129 पूर्वकोटि states,
as there is no lifespan greater than this due to the nature of the realm.
Regarding the Dharma of conduct, there are states from the most inferior
अन्तर्मुहूर्त to the most superior देशोनपूर्वकोटि.  _The state of अकर्मभूमिक
manustriyas is described from two perspectives: one from the perspective of
birth and the other from the perspective of संहरण. संहरण means to take a
कर्मभूमिज woman to the अकर्मभूमि.  /  Just as someone traveling from Magadh or
another country to Saurashtra, upon reaching Saurashtra and staying there, is
called a resident of Saurashtra for all practical purposes, similarly, a woman
taken from कर्मभूमि and संहृत in अकर्मभूमि is called a resident of कर्मभूमि.
From the perspective of birth, the state of अकर्मभूमिज women is देशोन (an
infinitesimal fraction of a पल्योपम) for the most inferior and three पल्योपम for
the most superior.  /  This should be understood in relation to the realm of
हैमवत and हैरण्यवत, as this is the possible range of states there. The most
superior state of three पल्योपम should be understood in relation to देवकुरु and
उत्तरकुरु.  /  From the perspective of संहरण, the most inferior state is
अन्तर्मुहूर्त and the most superior is देशोनपूर्वकोटि.  If a woman is संहृत from
कर्मभूमि to अकर्मभूमि and lives there only for an अन्तर्मुहूर्त or is संहृत back
from there, then her most inferior state is called अन्तर्मुहूर्त.  /  If that
woman has a lifespan of पूर्वकोटि in that realm, then her most superior state is
called देशोनपूर्वकोटि.  _There might be a doubt that Bharat and Eravata realms
are also in कर्मभूमि, and there too, a state of three पल्योपम exists in a
solitary period, and संहरण is also possible, then how is देशोनपूर्वकोटि
consistent for the most superior? The solution is that this is said from the
perspective of कर्मकाल, even though it is कर्मभूमि. In Bharat and Eravata
realms, in a solitary period of सुषमादि, a structure like भोगभूमि is created,
therefore it is not कर्मकाल. In कर्मकाल, there is only a lifespan of पूर्वकोटि,
therefore the stated देशोनपूर्वकोटि is consistent.  The state of अकर्मभूमिक
manustriyas in हैमवत and हैरण्यवत is देशोन पल्योपम (an infinitesimal fraction of
a पल्योपम) for the most inferior and a complete पल्योपम for the most superior
from the perspective of birth.  /  From the perspective of संहरण, the most
inferior state is अन्तर्मुहूर्त and the most superior is देशोनपूर्वकोटि.  The
state of women in Harivarsha and Ramyakavarsha is two पल्योपम less than an
infinitesimal fraction of a पल्योपम for the most inferior and a complete two
पल्योपम for the most superior from the perspective of birth.  /  From the
perspective of संहरण, the most inferior state is one अन्तर्मुहूर्त and the most
superior is देशोनपूर्वकोटि.  In देवकुरु and उत्तरकुरु, the most inferior state
is three पल्योपम less than an infinitesimal fraction of a पल्योपम and the most
superior state is a complete three पल्योपम from the perspective of birth.  /
From the perspective of संहरण, the most inferior state is one अन्तर्मुहूर्त and
the most superior is देशोनपूर्वकोटि.  The state of manustriyas in the
Antaradvipas is an infinitesimal fraction of a पल्योपम less than a पल्योपम for
the most inferior and an infinitesimal fraction of a पल्योपम for the most
superior from the perspective of birth.  /  The implication is that..._

[130] The innumerable parts of the lifespan of the most excellent *palyopama*
are the measure of the lifespan of the most inferior *palyopama*, and the
innumerable parts of the lifespan of the most inferior *palyopama* are the
measure of the lifespan of the most excellent *palyopama*. In terms of duration,
the most inferior *antarmuhurt* is less than the most excellent
*deshonapurvakoti*.  The lifespan of the *devastri* is from ten thousand years
to fifty-five *palyopama*. This is in comparison to the *devastri* of the
*bhavanapati* and *vyantar* realms. The lifespan of the *devistri* of the
*ishan* realm is considered the most excellent. In particular, the lifespan of
the *bhavanavasi* *devistri* is generally ten thousand years, and at its most
excellent, it is four and a half *palyopama*. This is in comparison to the
*asurakumari* *devistri*. Here too, in particular, the lifespan of the
*asurakumari* *devistri* is generally ten thousand years, and at its most
excellent, it is four and a half *palyopama*. The lifespan of the *nagakumari*
*devistri* is ten thousand years at its most inferior, and *deshonpalyopama* at
its most excellent. Similarly, the lifespan of the *suparnakumari* and the
*stanitakumari* should be understood.  The lifespan of the *dhyantar* *devistri*
is ten thousand years at its most inferior, and half a *palyopama* at its most
excellent. The lifespan of the *jyotishkastri* is one-fourth of a *palyopama* at
its most inferior, and fifty thousand years more than half a *palyopama* at its
most excellent. In particular, the lifespan of the *chandraviman* *devistri* is
one-fourth of a *palyopama* at its most inferior, and fifty thousand years more
than half a *palyopama* at its most excellent. The lifespan of the *suryaaviman*
*devistri* is one-fourth of a *palyopama* at its most inferior, and five hundred
years more than half a *palyopama* at its most excellent. The lifespan of the
*grahaaviman* *devistri* is one-fourth of a *palyopama* at its most inferior,
and half a *palyopama* at its most excellent. The lifespan of the
*nakshatraviman* *devistri* is one-fourth of a *palyopama* at its most inferior,
and slightly more than one-fourth of a *palyopama* at its most excellent. The
lifespan of the *taraviman* *devistri* is one *palyopama* at its most inferior,
and slightly more than one *palyopama* at its most excellent. The lifespan of
the *vaimanik* *devistri* is one *palyopama* at its most inferior, and fifty-
five *palyopama* at its most excellent. In particular, the lifespan of the
*soudharm* *devistri* is one *palyopama* at its most inferior, and seven
*palyopama* at its most excellent. This is in comparison to the *devistri* who
has been taken in. The lifespan of the *devistri* who has not been taken in is
one *palyopama* at its most inferior, and fifty-five *palyopama* at its most
excellent. The lifespan of the *ishan* *devistri* is slightly more than one
*palyopama* at its most inferior, and nine *palyopama* at its most excellent.
Here too, this is in comparison to the *devistri* who has been taken in. The
lifespan of the *devistri* who has not been taken in is slightly more than one
*palyopama* at its most inferior, and fifty-five *palyopama* at its most
excellent. The commentator has written that in many copies, this entire text
about lifespan is found, and in many copies, only this much is said: "And the
lifespan of the *devistri* should be said as follows: from one *palyopama* to
the *ishan* *devistri*."

## 132] . [Jivajivaabhigamsutra [The time period of a female being in the female
form, before reaching the peak, is said to be 110 palyopama more than the
previous koti. Its meaning is as follows: If a being is born in the form of a
human female or a female of the lower realms, with the lifespan of the previous
koti, and is born there five or six times, and then is born as an Aparigrihita
Devi in the Ishana Kalpa, with the status of 55 palyopama, and from there, due
to the decline of lifespan, is born again as a human female or a female of the
lower realms, with the lifespan of the previous koti, and from there, is born
again as an Aparigrihita Devi in the Ishana Devaloka, with the status of 55
palyopama, then after this, she will definitely attain the Vedantar. Thus, the
time period of being born five or six times as a human female or a female of the
lower realms, with the lifespan of the previous koti, and the time period of
being born twice in the Ishana Devaloka, with the status of 55 palyopama,
combined together, is 55+55 = 110 palyopama, which is the time period of the
previous koti separation. Here, the meaning of separation is many times. After
this much time, the Vedantar will definitely occur. Here, one may doubt that if
a being is born in the form of a female with a lifespan of three palyopama in
the Devakuru-Uttarakuru regions, then the time period of the Strived could be
even longer. The solution to this doubt is that the being of a Devi, who has
fallen from the Devi's state, is not born as a female in beings with an
immeasurable lifespan, nor can a female with an immeasurable lifespan be born in
Devis with a superior lifespan, because it is said in the Prajnapanasutra-Tika,
"Jato asankhejjavasaauya ukkosiyain thiin na pavei", meaning that a female with
an immeasurable lifespan does not attain the superior status. Therefore, the
aforementioned evidence is the superior time period of the Strived. (2) From
another perspective, the time period of the Strived is one time period at the
lowest and 18 palyopama more than the previous koti at the highest. The meaning
of one time period is the same as the first order. The meaning of the highest
time period is as follows: A being is born in the form of a human female and a
female of the lower realms for five consecutive times, and then is born twice in
the Ishana Devaloka as a Devi with a superior status, and is born only in the
Parigrihita Devis, not in the Aparigrihita Devis. The superior status of the
Parigrihita Devis is 9 palyopama, therefore, 9+9=18 palyopama is the time period
of the Ishana Devaloka. The time period of the human and lower realms, added to
the previous koti separation, is 18 palyopama more than the previous koti, which
is the time period of the Strived. 2 / / (3) From a third perspective, the time
period of the Strived is one time period at the lowest and 14 palyopama more
than the previous koti at the highest. The meaning of one time period is like
the first order. The meaning of the highest is as follows: Like the second
order, a being is born five or six times as a human female or a female of the
lower realms, and then is born twice as a Devi in the Saudharma Devaloka, with a
lifespan of 7 palyopama, in the form of a Parigrihita Devi. From this
perspective, the highest time period of the Strived is 14 palyopama more than
the previous koti separation. 3 /

## Second Consideration: The Duration of a Female Animal in its Form (4)  From
the fourth perspective, the duration of a female animal in its form is from a
minimum of one moment to a maximum of one hundred palya-upamas more than the
previous koti. The concept of one moment is according to the first order. The
concept of the maximum is as follows: A human female or a female animal with the
previous koti lifespan, after living in the same form for five or six times, is
born as an unattached goddess in the Saudharma heaven with a lifespan of fifty
palya-upamas. This happens twice, resulting in 50+50 = 100 palya-upamas. Adding
the time of the previous koti and the time of the female animal or human female,
the total duration is one hundred palya-upamas more than the previous koti. (4)
## (5)  From the fifth perspective, the duration of a female animal in its form
is from a minimum of one moment to a maximum of one palya-upamas more than the
previous koti. The concept of the minimum is the same as before. The concept of
the maximum is as follows: A being, after living as a human female or a female
animal with the previous koti lifespan for seven births, is born in the eighth
birth as a female in the form of a female among the Devakaruyaadika, who have a
lifespan of three palya-upamas. From there, after death, they are born as a
goddess in the Saudharma heaven, in the lowest category of goddesses (with a
lifespan of one palya-upamas). After this, there is definitely a Vedantar. Thus,
the duration of a female animal in its form is one palya-upamas more than the
previous koti, which is the evidence.  ## Conclusion  Which of these five orders
is appropriate can only be determined by someone with extraordinary knowledge or
someone who has attained the highest level of scriptural knowledge. Since such a
situation does not exist at present, the sutrakar has mentioned all five orders
without making any decision of his own. We should understand all five orders as
different perspectives, considering the truth to be only knowable by the Kevali.
## Duration of a Female Animal in its Form (2)  O Bhagavan! How long can a
female animal remain in the form of a female animal?  Gautama! From the minimum,
it can remain for an antarmukhuta, and from the maximum, it can remain for three
palya-upamas more than the previous koti.  A water creature can remain from the
minimum, an antarmukhuta, to the maximum, the previous koti.  Regarding the
four-legged land creatures, it is the same as the female animal.  The sky
creatures, from the minimum, an antarmukhuta, to the maximum, one palya-upamas
more than the previous koti, are countless.

[134] Regarding the *Urapasarpastri* and *Bhujapasarpastri*, one should say like
a water creature. The *Khechari* can remain as a *Khecharastri* for an
immeasurable fraction of a *Palyopam* time, from the lowest *Antarmuhurta* to
the highest *Purvakotiprithaktva*.   **Discussion:** This sutra states the time
duration for a *Tiriyachstri* to remain as a *Tiriyachstri*. A *Tiriyachstri*
can remain as a *Tiriyachstri* from the lowest *Antarmuhurta* time to the
highest *Purvakotiprithaktva* time, which is three *Palyopamas*.   The meaning
of this is as follows: If a *Tiriyachstri* has a lifespan of only *Antarmuhurta*
and dies, attaining *Vedantar* or a unique state like a human, then the lowest
state duration of *Antarmuhurta* is appropriate.   The meaning of the highest
state duration is as follows: A human and a *Tiriyach* can continuously
experience eight births in the same form, but not more. Out of these, seven
births have a lifespan of countable years, and the eighth birth has a lifespan
of immeasurable years.   If a sufficient human or a sufficient sentient five-
sense *Tiriyach* continuously experiences seven births of sufficient humans or
seven births of sufficient sentient five-sense *Tiriyach*, and is born again in
the eighth birth as a sufficient human or a sufficient sentient five-sense
*Tiriyach*, then according to the rule, it has an immeasurable lifespan, not a
countable lifespan.   A being with an immeasurable lifespan, upon death, is
usually born in the *Devaloka*. Therefore, the ninth birth is not usually that
of a human or a sentient five-sense *Tiriyach*.   Therefore, when the previous
seven births are of the highest *Purvakoti* lifespan, and the eighth birth is in
*Devakuru* etc., for three *Palyopamas* at the highest, then the duration of the
*Tiriyastri* is three *Palyopamas* more than *Purvakotiprithaktva*.   In
particular, a water creature female can continuously remain as a water creature
female from the lowest *Antarmuhurta* to the highest *Purvakotiprithaktva*.
After experiencing seven births of a water creature with a *Purvakoti* lifespan,
there is definitely a change in the birth of a water creature.   The statement
regarding a four-legged land creature is similar to that of a *Tiriyachstri*.
That is, from the lowest *Antarmuhurta* to the highest *Purvakotiprithaktva*, it
is three *Palyopamas*.   The statement regarding the *Urapasarpastri* and
*Bhujapasarpastri* is according to the statement regarding the water creature
female. That is, from the lowest *Antarmuhurta* to the highest
*Purvakotiprithaktva*.   The duration of the *Khecharastri* is an immeasurable
fraction of a *Palyopam* time, from the lowest *Antarmuhurta* to the highest
*Purvakotiprithaktva*.   Thus, the duration of the *Tiriyachstri* has been
stated in general and specific terms. The duration of the human female is
similar.

## Second Chapter: The Duration of Human Women in the State of Tarup  **[137]**
**Lord!** For how long can a Dev-stri (divine woman) remain in the form of a
Dev-stri? **Gautam!** Her duration is the same as her state of being.
**Discussion:** The general duration of human women is the same as that of the
general Tiryanch-stri (animal women), i.e., from the lowest, Antarmuhurt (a very
short time), to the highest, Deshon Purvakoti (a very long time), plus three
Palyopam (a unit of time). The meaning of this has been explained earlier in the
context of Tiryanch-stri, and should be understood accordingly.  **The duration
of a human woman in the Karmabhoomi (world of action) is, generally speaking,
from the lowest, Antarmuhurt, to the highest, Deshon Purvakoti, plus three
Palyopam, considering the Karmakshetra (field of action).** After this, her
abandonment is possible. This duration is for the seven Bhav (states of
existence) Mahavidehas (great non-physical realms) and the eighth Bhav, Bharat-
Airavat (human and celestial realms). In the case of Ekant Sushma (a state of
subtle body) and other Praraks (initial stages), one should understand the
duration as three Palyopam.  **Considering Dharmacharan (righteous conduct), the
lowest duration is one time, because due to the peculiarity of the destruction
and pacification of Tadavaran Karma (karma that binds to the soul), there is a
possibility of one time.** After death, the character is lost. **The highest
duration is Deshon Purvakoti, because the complete duration of character is also
Deshon Purvakoti.**  **The duration of a human woman in the Bharat-Airavat
Karmabhoomi is from the lowest, Antarmuhurt, to the highest, Deshon Purvakoti,
plus three Palyopam.** The explanation is as follows: A woman with the lifespan
of Purvakoti (a very long time) in the Purva-Videha (eastern non-physical realm)
or Pachim-Videha (western non-physical realm) is collected in the Bharat-Airavat
realm during the Ekant Sushma period. Although she was born in the Mahavideha
realm, she is considered to be from the Bharat-Airavat realm due to the example
of the Magadh man mentioned earlier. That woman lives for Purvakoti and then,
upon the exhaustion of her lifespan, is born in the Bharat-Airavat realm at the
beginning of the Ekant Sushma Prarak. From this perspective, her duration is
Deshon Purvakoti plus three Palyopam.  **Considering Dharmacharan, the duration
should be understood as one time from the lowest and Deshon Purvakoti from the
highest, similar to the Karmabhoomi woman.**  **The duration of a woman in the
Purva-Videha and Pachim-Videha Karmabhoomi is from the lowest, Antarmuhurt, to
the highest, Purvakoti, considering the realm.** This should be understood from
the perspective of rebirth. **Considering Dharmacharan, the duration is one time
from the lowest and Deshon Purvakoti from the highest.**  This is the statement
about Karmabhoomi women.  **The general duration of an Akarmabhoomi (world
without action) human woman is from the lowest, Deshon Palyopam, considering
birth.** Ashta Bhag (eight parts) and other Pradis (initial stages) are also
Deshon. Therefore, to clarify the lower limit, it is said that the countless
part of Palyopam is less than one Palyopam. **The highest duration is three
Palyopam.**  **Considering Sanharan (absorption), the lowest duration is
Antarmuhurt.** This is from the perspective of absorption while the lifespan of
Antarmuhurt remains. **The highest duration is Deshon Purvakoti plus three
Palyopam.** The explanation is as follows: A human woman from the Purva-Videha
or Pachim-Videha with a lifespan of Deshon Purvakoti is absorbed in the Devakuru
(a celestial realm) etc. She is considered to be from the Devakuru due to the
example of the Magadh man mentioned earlier. She is there in the Deshon...

[138] A woman who has attained the *kaladharma* (natural lifespan) before the
*purvakoti* (first stage of existence) and has been born with a lifespan of
three *palyopamas* (units of time). In this way, the *deshon* (duration of
existence) is three *palyopamas* more than the *purvakoti*. This demonstrates
that the *sanharan* (destruction) of a woman with a lifespan of less than an
*antarmuhurt* (short period of time) and a fetus does not occur. Otherwise, the
*deshon* of the *purvakoti* cannot be proven from the *antarmuhurt* and the
*purvakoti*.    Specifically, the *deshon* of women in the *haimvat*,
*airanyavat*, *harivarsha*, *ramyavarsha*, *devakuru*, *uttarakuru*, and
*antarvipija* (different realms of existence) is the same as their current
state, not their birth.    The *deshon* should be understood as three
*palyopamas* more than the *purvakoti* from the *antarmuhurt* in the case of
*sanharan* and from the current state in the case of *utkarsha* (excellence).
This concise statement should be understood clearly as follows:  * The *deshon*
of a human woman in the *haimvat* and *airanyavat* is one *palyopam* less than
the *palyopamasankhyeyabhag* (incalculable number of *palyopamas*) from birth
and a full *palyopam* from *utkarsha*. From *sanharan*, it is one *palyopam*
more than the *antarmuhurt* and the *purvakoti* from *utkarsha*. * The *deshon*
of a human woman in the *harivarsha* and *ramyavarsha* is two *palyopamas* less
than the *palyopamasankhyeyabhag* from birth and two full *palyopamas* from
*utkarsha*. From *sanharan*, it is two *palyopamas* more than the *antarmuhurt*
and the *purvakoti* from *utkarsha*. * The *deshon* of a human woman in the
*devakuru* and *uttarakuru* is three *palyopamas* less than the
*palyopamasankhyeyabhag* from birth and three full *palyopamas* from *utkarsha*.
From *sanharan*, it is three *palyopamas* more than the *antarmuhurt* and the
*purvakoti* from *utkarsha*. * The *deshon* of a human woman in the
*antarvipija* is an incalculable fraction of a *palyopam* less than the
*palyopamasankhyeyabhag* from birth and an incalculable fraction of a *palyopam*
from *utkarsha*. From *sanharan*, it is an incalculable fraction of a *palyopam*
more than the *antarmuhurt* and the *purvakoti* from *utkarsha*.  The *deshon*
of *devistri* (divine women) is the same as their current state. This is because
they do not experience *kayasthiti* (physical existence) due to their
*bhavasvabhav* (nature of existence). Divine beings do not die and become divine
again.  **Interlude 46:**  "Thus, Venerable One, what is the difference in
time?"  "Gotama, from the *antarmuhurt* to the *anantakal* (infinite time) is
the *vanassaikalo* (time of destruction) for all *tirikkh* (non-human beings).
For human beings, from the *antarmuhurt* to the *vanassaikalo* is the time for
the *khettapaddutti* (destruction of the body). From the *ekkasamaya* (one
moment) to the *anantakal* is the time for *dhammacharan* (practice of virtue)
until the *avadpoggalpariyat* (complete liberation) is attained. This continues
until the *pumvavi-deha* (previous body) and *avidehiya* (liberated being) are
attained.  "Venerable One, what is the difference in time for those who have
attained the *akammabhum* (state of non-action)?"

it is called the interval for a woman.  In general, the interval for a woman is
from a **muhūrta** in the lowest case to **infinite time** or **the time of a

her womanhood, and experiences the **muhūrta** of a **male** or **neuter**
state, and then dies again and is reborn as a woman, then the lowest interval is
the **muhūrta**.  The highest interval is **the time of a plant**.  /  **The
time of a plant** is the time of countless **pudgala-paravartans**.  /  In this
infinite time, countless **utsarpini** and **avasarpini** periods pass,
countless **lokas** and countless **pudgala-paravartans** pass in the **field**.
The time of these **pudgala-paravartans** is a fraction of the time of the
**pravalika**.  /  For such a long time, the woman's womanhood is interrupted,
and then she regains it.  Similarly, the interval for **Tiryachch-stries**,
**aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial women**, and **human women** should be
understood.  **1.** "**Infinite utsarpini and avasarpini time, infinite lokas in
the field, countless pudgala-paravartans**" - this is the **time of a plant**.

[140] One should know that the difference between human beings in the realm of
karma (Karm-bhoomi) and women in the realm of karma, in terms of their lifespan,
is from a very short time (antar-muhurt) to an infinite time (vanaspati-kal),
which is the time taken for a plant to grow. In terms of religious practice, the
difference is from a short time to an infinite time, which is the time taken for
the complete transformation of the pudgala (deshona aparrdh pudgal paravart).
There is no longer a time for the attainment of liberation (charan-labdhi). The
time for the attainment of liberation (darshan-labdhi) is prohibited in all
places where the complete transformation of the pudgala has taken place.
Similarly, one should understand the difference between human beings and women
in the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi) and the women of the eastern and western
Videha (purva videha paschim videha) in terms of their lifespan and religious
practice. The difference between human beings in the realm of karma (Karm-
bhoomi) and women in the realm of karma, in terms of their birth, is from a very
short time (antar-muhurt) to ten thousand years. The explanation is as follows:
A woman in the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi) dies and is reborn in the realm of
the lower gods (devas). After living for ten thousand years, she dies and is
reborn in the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi) as a man or a woman (because no one
is born directly in the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi) from the realm of the gods
(devas)). She dies after a very short time (antar-muhurt) and is reborn as a
woman in the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi). This is the difference between a very
short time (antar-muhurt) and ten thousand years. The difference in terms of
their lifespan is the time taken for a plant to grow (vanaspati-kal). The
difference between a very short time (antar-muhurt) and the time taken for a
plant to grow (vanaspati-kal) in terms of their death is as follows: A woman in
the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi) is taken to the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi)
and after a very short time (antar-muhurt), her mind is changed and she is
placed back in the same place. The difference in terms of their lifespan is the
time taken for a plant to grow (vanaspati-kal). In such a long time, death also
occurs in the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi) just like birth. A woman in the realm
of karma (Karm-bhoomi) is taken to the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi). After her
lifespan is over, she wanders for an infinite time in the form of plants, etc.,
and is reborn in the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi). If someone takes her to the
realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi) from there, then this is the time taken for death
(sanharan). Similarly, one should say that the difference between human beings
and women in the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi) and the women of the Himavat,
Hairanyavat, Hari-varsha, Ramya-varsha, Deva-kuru, Uttara-kuru, and the inner
islands (antar-vipas) in terms of their birth and death is from a very short
time (antar-muhurt) to an infinite time (vanaspati-kal). The difference between
the women of the gods (devas) is from a very short time (antar-muhurt) to the
time taken for a plant to grow (vanaspati-kal). A woman who has fallen from the
state of a goddess (devi) is born as a human being. After she has fulfilled her
lifespan and died due to various causes, she is reborn as a goddess (devi). This
is the difference between a very short time (antar-muhurt) and the time taken
for a plant to grow (vanaspati-kal). Similarly, one should know that the
difference between the women of the Asura-kumaras, the goddesses, and the women
of the Ishana-kalpa is from a very short time (antar-muhurt) to the time taken
for a plant to grow (vanaspati-kal).  Alpabahutva 50. (1) "Etaasi nam bhanta!

## Second Understanding: Scarcity [143]  **Scarcity** is explained in five ways
in this sutra.  **(1)** **General Scarcity:**  Human women are the least
numerous, with their number being a mere koti-koti (a specific large number).
Animal women are countless times more numerous, as each island and ocean teems
with them, and islands and oceans are countless.  Divine women are countless
times more numerous than animal women, as the Bhavanavasi, Vyantara, Jyotishka,
and Saudharma-Ishana goddesses each occupy countless regions of space. This is
the first type of scarcity.  **(2)** **Scarcity among Animal Women:**  The least
numerous are the flying animal women.  Land-dwelling animal women are countless
times more numerous, as they are naturally more abundant than flying animals.
Water-dwelling animal women are countless times more numerous, as the salt
ocean, the Kalod ocean, and the Swayambhuraman ocean are teeming with fish, and
the Swayambhuraman ocean is vast beyond all other islands and oceans.  **(3)**
**Scarcity among Human Women:**  The least numerous are the human women of the
Akarmabhoomi in the inner islands, as the region is small.  The women of
Devakuru and Uttar Kuru are countless times more numerous, as the region is
countless times larger.  The women of both regions are equal in number, as their
regions are of equal size.  The women of the Harivarsha and Ramyakavarsha
Akarmabhoomi are countless times more numerous, as the region is much larger
than Devakuru and Uttar Kuru.  The women of both regions are equal in number, as
their regions are of equal size.  The women of the Haimavat and Hairanyavat
Akarmabhoomi are countless times more numerous, as their abundance is due to
their low status, even though the region is small.  The women of both regions
are equal in number, as their regions are of equal size.  The women of the
Bharat and Airavat Karmabhoomi are equal in number...

## Translation:  **[144]** The number of *jiva* in the *jiva-jiva-migama-sutra*
is innumerable, because they are naturally abundant due to being the *karma-
bhoomi*. They are equal to each other in their respective locations, because
both regions have the same structure. The number of human females in the *karma-
bhoomi* of *purva-videha* and *paschima-videha* is innumerable, because they are
naturally abundant there due to the abundance of the region, similar to the time
of *Ajitanatha* Tirthankara. They are equal to each other in their respective
locations, because they have the same regional structure.  **(4)** The fourth
*alpa-bahutva* relates to four types of goddesses. The least numerous are the
*vaimanika* goddesses, because the number of *pradesh* in the *dhani-krita*
*loka* is equal to the square root of the number of *pradesh* in an angul-maatra
region multiplied by its cube root, minus one thirty-second of the total number
of *pradesh* in the *dhani-krita* *loka*. The number of *sau-dharma* *deva-loka*
goddesses is equal to this number, and the number of *ishana* *deva-loka*
goddesses is also equal to this number. The number of *bhavana-vaasi* goddesses
is innumerable times greater than the number of *vaimanika* goddesses, because
the number of *bhavana-vaasi* goddesses is equal to the square root of the
number of *pradesh* in an angul-maatra region multiplied by its square root,
minus one thirty-second of the total number of *pradesh* in the region. The
number of *vyantara* goddesses is innumerable times greater than the number of
*bhavana-vaasi* goddesses, because the number of *vyantara* goddesses is equal
to the number of *khanda* in a *pradesh* of *san-khyeya* *yojana* in a *pradesh*
of one *pradesh* *shreni*, minus one thirty-second of the total number of
*khanda*. The number of *jyotishka* goddesses is innumerable times greater than
the number of *vyantara* goddesses, because the number of *jyotishka* goddesses
is equal to the number of *pradesh* in a *pradesh* of 256 *angul*, minus one
thirty-second of the total number of *pradesh*.  **(5)** The fifth *alpa-
bahutva* relates to all female beings. The least numerous are the human females
of the *antar-vipa* *karma-bhoomi*. The human females of *deva-kuru* and *uttar-
kuru* are innumerable times greater than them. The human females of *hari-
varsha* and *ramya-varsha* are innumerable times greater than them. The human
females of *hemavat* and *hairanya-vat* are innumerable times greater than them.
The human females of *bharat* and *eravat* *karma-bhoomi* are innumerable times
greater than them. The human females of *purva-videha* and *paschima-videha* are
innumerable times greater than them. Their explanation should be understood as
before. The number of *vaimanika* goddesses is innumerable times greater than
the number of human females of *purva-videha* and *paschima-videha*, because
they are equal to the number of *akash-pradesh* in innumerable *shreni*. The
number of *bhavana-vaasi* goddesses is innumerable times greater than them, as
explained before. The number of *khechara* goddesses is innumerable times
greater than them. They are equal to the number of *akash-pradesh* in
innumerable *shreni* in innumerable parts of a *pradesh*. The number of *sthala-
chara* goddesses is innumerable times greater than them, because they are equal
to the number of *akash-pradesh* in innumerable *shreni* in the innumerable part
of a large *pradesh*. The number of *jala-chara* *tiyancha* goddesses is
innumerable times greater than them, because they are equal to the number of
*akash-pradesh* in innumerable *shreni* in the innumerable part of the largest
*pradesh*. The number of *vyantara* goddesses is innumerable times greater than
them, because the number of *vyantara* goddesses is equal to the number of
*khanda* in a *pradesh* of *koti-koti* *yojana* in a *pradesh* of one *shreni*,
minus one thirty-second of the total number of *khanda*. The number of
*jyotishka* goddesses is innumerable times greater than the number of *vyantara*
goddesses, as explained before. The number of females...

## Second Chapter: The State of Striveda [145]  **The State of Striveda** [51]
"O Lord! How long is the bondage state of Striveda karma?"  "Gautama! The lowest
state of Striveda is less than an innumerable part of a Palya by the seventh
part of one and a half Sagara. The highest state of Striveda is fifteen Kodakodi
Sagara. The period of non-obstruction is fifteen hundred years. The state of
karma that is devoid of the period of non-obstruction is the one that is
experienced, and therefore it is the Karma-nisheka (the creation of karma-
dalis)."  "O Lord! How is Striveda described?"  "Gautama! Striveda is like the
fire of Fufu (the fire of the forest)."  Thus, the rights of women are
fulfilled. The experience of the Striveda karma arises from the experience of
the Striveda karma. Therefore, the proof of the lowest and highest states of
Striveda karma is presented in this sutra.  Gautama Swami asked, "O Lord! How
long is the bondage state of Striveda?"  In response, the Lord said, "The lowest
bondage state of Striveda is less than an innumerable part of a Palya by the
seventh part of one and a half Sagara."  The method of bringing about the lowest
state is as follows: In the highest state of bondage of a particular nature, the
amount obtained by dividing the highest state of Mithyatva by seventy Kodakodi
Sagara, and then subtracting an innumerable part of a Palya from it, is the
lowest state of that nature.  The highest state of Striveda is fifteen Kodakodi
Sagara. When we divide it by seventy Kodakodi Sagara, we get twenty-four
Kodakodi Sagara. According to the principle of Chhedya-Chhedaka, dividing this
amount by ten gives us "Kodakodi Sagara" as the state. Subtracting an
innumerable part of a Palya from this gives us the aforementioned state.  This
explanation is according to the original commentary. According to the
Panchasangraha, the magnitude of the lowest state is the same, only it should
not be said that it is less than an innumerable part of a Palya.  The Karma-
prakriti Sangrahani-kara has described another method of bringing about the
lowest state.  "From the statement, 'The amount obtained by the highest state of
Mithyatva is less than an innumerable part of a Palya' - Karma-prakriti
Sangraha.  "The amount obtained by the highest state of Mithyatva is less than
an innumerable part of a Palya."  "The remainder is less than an innumerable
part of a Palya." - Karma-prakriti Sangraha.

[146] The natures of karmas like Jobajovaabhigamsutra are called categories like
Gyaanavaranee etc. The highest state of a category is the highest state of
Mithyaatva, and by dividing it by the number of Palyopama, the lowest state is
obtained. Here, the nature of the category of Strived, Nokashaayamoha is twenty
Kodakodi Sagaropama. By dividing it by seventy Kodakodi Sagaropama (by dividing
zero by zero), the state of Kodakodi Sagaropama is formed. That is, the seventh
part of two Kodakodi Sagaropama, by subtracting the number of Palyopama from it,
the lowest state of Strived is obtained in this way, Kodakodi Sagaropama with a
number of Palyopama less. The highest state of Strived is fifteen Kodakodi
Sagaropama. There are two types of states - Karma Rupa Avasthan Rupa and Anubhav
Yogya. The state mentioned here is Karma Rupa Avasthan Rupa. The Anubhav Yogya
state is less than the Aabaadha Kaal. The karma that has the highest state of
Kodakodi Sagaropama, its Aabaadha Kaal is one hundred years. For example, the
highest state of Strived is fifteen Kodakodi Sagaropama, so its Aabaadha Kaal is
fifteen hundred years. That is, for so long, the bound nature does not rise and
does not give its fruit. After the Aabaadha Kaal is over, the Karma Dalikas are
created, that is, that nature rises. This is called Karma Nishaek. The Karma
state that is less than the Aabaadha Kaal is Anubhav Yogya. After the bound
state of Strived, Gautam Swami asked the type of Strived. In response, Bhagwan
said that Strived is like the fire of Fumphuk (Kaarish-Chhane), that is, it
awakens slowly and remains for a long time. Thus, the authority regarding women
ends. The exposition regarding men is from 52.   Se ki tan purisa? Purisa ti
viha panatta, tan jaha - tirikhjooniy purisa, manuss purisa, dev purisa. Se ki

## Second Chapter: Time Duration [147 [52]  **What are men and how many types
are there?** There are three types of men: *tiryakyonik* men, human men, and
divine men.  **How many types of *tiryakyonik* men are there?** There are three
types of *tiryakyonik* men: aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial.  **Just as the
distinctions in the rights of women have been mentioned, so should it be
mentioned up to the aerial beings.** This is the description of the aerial
beings and, along with them, the *tiryakyonik* aerial men.  **O Lord! How many
types of human men are there?** Gautam! There are three types of human men:
*karmabhumik*, *akarmabhumik*, and *antarvipik*. These are the distinctions
among humans.  **How many types of divine men are there?** There are four types
of divine men. Just as the distinctions mentioned in the rights of women should
be mentioned, so should the distinctions of divine men be mentioned up to the
*sarvarthasiiddha*.  **Discussion:** The distinctions mentioned in the rights of
women should be mentioned in the distinctions of men. The special feature is
only in the divine men. There are four types of divine men: *bhavanpati*,
*vanavyantar*, *jyotishk*, and *vaimanik*.  **The *bhavanpati* has 10
distinctions, such as *asurakumar*. The *vanavyantar* has distinctions such as
*pisaach*. The *jyotishk* has five distinctions, such as *chandra*. The
*vaimanik* gods are of two types: *kalopappan* and *kalpaatit*.**  **The twelve
divine realms, such as *soudharma*, are *kalopappan*. The *graiveyak* and
*anuttaropapati* gods are *kalpaatit*.**  **The *anuttaropapati* has five
distinctions: *vijay*, *vaijayant*, *jayant*, *aparaajit*, and
*sarvarthasiiddha*.**  **Therefore, it is said, "Jaa samvatthasiiddha".**  ##
Time Duration 53  **O Lord! What is the time duration of a man?** Gautam! The
lowest is an *antarmuhurt* and the highest is thirty-three *sagaropama*.  **The
time duration of *tiryakyonik* men and human men should be known to be the same
as that of *tiryakyonik* women and human women. The time duration of divine men,
up to the *sarvarthasiiddha* gods of the *vaimanik* realm, should be known to be
the same as that mentioned in the *prajnaapana* in the section on time
duration.**  **Discussion:** When asked about the time duration of men without
leaving their own existence, the Lord said that the lowest is an *antarmuhurt*
and the highest is thirty-three *sagaropama*. The lowest time duration is
mentioned as an *antarmuhurt* because of the possibility of death within an
*antarmuhurt*. The highest time duration is mentioned as thirty-three
*sagaropama* because of the *anuttaropapati* gods.

[148] The state of the **tiryanch** male beings, the aquatic, terrestrial, and
aerial male beings, is the same as that of the **tiryanch** female beings
mentioned earlier. The state of the **paudhik** and **karmabhoomi-akarmabhoomi-
antarvipa** human male beings should be understood in the same way as that of
the women in their respective categories, both in general and in particular. For
clarity, the details are as follows:  The state of the **tiryanch** male beings
is from the lowest **antarmuhurt** to the highest **three palyopama** for the
**niyanch** male beings. For the aquatic male beings, it is from the lowest
**antarmuhurt** to the highest **purvakoti**. For the quadruped terrestrial male
beings, it is from the lowest **antarmuhurt** to the highest **three
palyopama**. For the **urparisarp** terrestrial male beings, it is from the
lowest **antarmuhurt** to the highest **purvakoti**. For the **bhujparisarp**
terrestrial male beings and the aerial male beings, it is from the lowest
**antarmuhurt** to the highest **an uncountable part of palyopama**.  The state
of the human male beings is from the lowest **antarmuhurt** to the highest
**three palyopama** for the **paudhik** human male beings. In terms of religious
practice, the lowest is **antarmuhurt** and the highest is **deshon purvakoti**.
The lowest **antarmuhurt** state is in relation to the external **linga** and
the acceptance of **pravrajya**. Otherwise, even a **samayik** (temporary)
**charanparinam** (change of state) is possible. Alternatively, due to the
complete breaking of **deshivirati** (abstinence from worldly desires), the
lowest **antarmuhurt** is possible. After the age of eight years, the state of
**purvakoti** is considered higher than that of someone who has attained
**charan-pratipatti** (acceptance of the path) before the age of **purvakoti**.
The state of the **karmabhoomi** human beings is from the lowest **antarmuhurt**
to the highest **three palyopama**. In terms of **charitradharma** (moral
conduct), their state is from the lowest **antarmuhurt** to the highest **deshon
purvakoti**. The lowest state of the **bharat** and **airavat** **karmabhoomi**
human male beings is **antarmuhurt** in relation to the **kshetra** (region) and
the highest is **three palyopama**. This is in relation to the **sushama-
sushama** (favorable-unfavorable) time. In terms of **charitradharma**, the
lowest state is **antarmuhurt** and the highest is **deshon purvakoti**. The
lowest state of the **purvavideh** and **paschimavideh** male beings is
**antarmuhurt** in relation to the **kshetra** and the highest is **deshon
purvakoti**. In terms of **charandharma** (religious practice), the lowest is
**antarmuhurt** and the highest is **deshon purvakoti**.  The state of the
**akarmabhoomi** human male beings is generally from the lowest **a part of
palyopama less than an uncountable part of palyopama** to the highest **three
palyopama** in relation to birth. In terms of **sanharan** (destruction of
karma), the lowest is **antarmuhurt** and the highest is **deshon purvakoti**.
The state of the **haimavat** and **airanyavat** human male beings is from the
lowest **a part of palyopama less than an uncountable part of palyopama** to the
highest **a full palyopama** in relation to birth. In terms of **sanharan**, the
lowest is **antarmuhurt** and the highest is **deshon purvakoti**. The state of
the **harivarsha** and **ramyakavarsha** human male beings is from the lowest
**two parts of palyopama less than an uncountable part of palyopama** to the
highest...

## Second Understanding: The Duration of a Man Remaining in the Form of a Man
**[151]** **O Bhagavan!** For how long can a man remain continuously in the form
of a man? **Gautama:** From the least, an antarmukhurta, to the most, a time
exceeding three palyopama by a shatapruthaktva (two hundred to nine hundred
sagaropama). **O Bhagavan!** For how long can a man of the animal realm remain
continuously in that form? **Gautama:** From the least, an antarmukhurta, to the
most, a time exceeding three palyopama by a purvakotiprthaktva. **[54]**    **O
Bhagavan!** For how long can a man remain continuously in the form of a man?
**Gautama:** From the least, an antarmukhurta, to the most, a time exceeding
three palyopama by a shatapruthaktva (two hundred to nine hundred sagaropama).
**O Bhagavan!** For how long can a man of the animal realm remain continuously
in that form? **Gautama:** From the least, an antarmukhurta, to the most, a time
exceeding three palyopama by a purvakotiprthaktva.   Thus, the duration of a man
remaining in the form of a man is the same as the duration of a woman remaining
in the form of a woman, and so on, up to the duration of a man of the animal
realm. The duration of a man of the akarmabhumi is the same as the duration of a
woman of the akarmabhumi. Similarly, the duration of a man of the antaradvipa is
the same as the duration of a man of the akarmabhumi. The duration of a deva is
the same as the duration of a deva of the sarvarthasiddha.   **Discussion:** For
how long can a man remain continuously in the form of a man without abandoning
the man-form? In response to this question, Bhagavan said that from the least,
an antarmukhurta, to the most, a time exceeding two hundred to nine hundred
sagaropama. A man who dies after an antarmukhurta and is reborn as a woman,
etc., is considered to have lived for an antarmukhurta. Generally, in the realms
of the animal, human, and deva, a man can remain in the form of a man for this
duration. This duration should be understood as slightly more than the duration
of a human realm. A man cannot remain continuously in the form of a man for a
longer duration than this. He will inevitably be reborn as a woman, etc. The
same applies to men of the animal realm as it does to women of the animal realm.

## 152 [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra]  **Tiryak-Yoni (lower animal realm) males can
remain in their male form continuously from the lowest (Jghanya) to the
Antarmuhurta (a very short time) without abandoning their masculinity. After
death, they attain a different state of existence (Gatyantar) or a different
state of knowledge (Vedantar).**  **From the highest (Utkarhsa) to the Pre-Koți-
Pruthaktva (a very long time), they can remain for a maximum of three Pal-
Yopamas (a very long time).**  **Seven of these existences are in the Pre-Koți
lifespan, including the Videha (liberated) state, and the eighth existence is in
the Deva-Kuru and Uttara-Kuru realms, where the lifespan is three Pal-Yopamas.**
**In this way, they can remain in the same form for a period of time equal to a
Pal-Yopamas and Pre-Koți-Pruthaktva (many Pre-Koți).**  **From the lowest
(Jghanya) to the Pre-Koți-Pruthaktva, the Jal-Char-Parusha (aquatic animal) male
should be understood as being reborn repeatedly, two, three, or four times.**
**From the lowest (Jghanya) to the Antarmuhurta, and from the highest (Utkarhsa)
to the Pre-Koți-Pruthaktva, the Chatush-Pad-Sthal-Char (quadruped) male should
be understood in the same way as the previously mentioned Tiryak male.**  **From
the lowest (Jghanya) to the Antarmuhurta, and from the highest (Utkarhsa) to the
Pre-Koți-Pruthaktva, the Ur-Parisarp (snake) and Bhuj-Parisarp (lizard) Sthal-
Char males should be understood in the same way as the previously mentioned Jal-
Char male.**  **From the lowest (Jghanya) to the Antarmuhurta, and from the
highest (Utkarhsa) to the Pre-Koți-Pruthaktva, the Khechar (flying animal) male
should be understood as being reborn for a period of time equal to an
innumerable fraction of a Pal-Yopamas.**  **Seven of these existences are in the
Pre-Koți lifespan, and the eighth existence is in the Antar-Vipadi
(intermediate) Khechar male (those who exist for an innumerable fraction of a
Pal-Yopamas).**  **The duration of the continuous existence of human males in
their form is according to the previously mentioned duration of human females
(Vaktanyata).**  **It is as follows: The duration of the continuous existence of
a human male in his form, from the lowest (Jghanya) to the Antarmuhurta, and
from the highest (Utkarhsa) to the Pre-Koți-Pruthaktva, is a maximum of three
Pal-Yopamas.**  **Seven of these existences are in the Maha-Videha (great
liberated) state, with a Pre-Koți lifespan, and the eighth existence is in the
Deva-Kuru and other realms, with a lifespan of three Pal-Yopamas.**  **In terms
of Dharma-Charan (religious practice), the lowest is one time, and the highest
is Deshon (a very long time) Pre-Koți.**  **After a lifespan of one year,
Charitra-Pratipatti (character development) occurs. Therefore, Deshon is said to
be eight years less.**  **In a specific context, the human male in the Karma-
Bhoomi (realm of action) can remain continuously in his form from the lowest
(Jghanya) to the Antarmuhurta, and from the highest (Utkarhsa) to the Pre-Koți-
Pruthaktva, for a maximum of three Pal-Yopamas.**  **This should be understood
as being reborn seven times in the Pre-Koți lifespan, and the eighth time in the
Bharat-Airavat (human realm) in the Ekant-Sushma-Pare (state of pure
consciousness) with a lifespan of three Pal-Yopamas.**  **In terms of Dharma-
Charan (religious practice), the lowest is one time (the result of Sarva-Virati
(complete renunciation) can also be one time), and the highest is Deshon Pre-
Koți.**  **The total duration of Charitra (character) is also the same.**  **The
human male in the Bharat-Airavat Karma-Bhoomi can also remain continuously in
his form from the lowest (Jghanya) to the Antarmuhurta, and from the highest
(Utkarhsa) to the Deshon Pre-Koți, for a maximum of three Pal-Yopamas.**  **This
should be understood as being reborn in the Bharat-Airavat realm after being
brought from the Videha realm with a Pre-Koți lifespan, and being designated as
a Bharat-Kshetriya (belonging to the Bharat realm). This is because the lifespan
of the existence is reduced, and the human male is born at the beginning of the
Ekant-Sushma-Kal (state of pure consciousness).**  **In terms of Dharma-Charan
(religious practice), the lowest is one time, and the highest is Deshon Pre-
Koți.**  **This is the summary (Sanchittana).**

## Second Chapter: Inter-Door [153]  **[East and West Videha Karmabhoomi]** A
human being in the East and West Videha Karmabhoomi can remain in the same form
for a period ranging from a mere Antarmuhurt (a very short time) to a period as
long as the Purvakoti (a very long time), depending on their karmic merit. They
should understand this in relation to the seven births they experience in this
realm. After that, there is a definite change in their motion and womb.
**[Karmabhoomi]** A human being in the Karmabhoomi can remain in the same form
for a period ranging from a mere Palyopama (a very long time) to a period as
long as three Palyopama, depending on their karmic merit.   **[Death]** The
shortest time a human being in the Karmabhoomi can remain in the same form
before death is an Antarmuhurt (this Antarmuhurt is in relation to the remaining
lifespan in the Karmabhoomi). The longest time they can remain in the same form
before death is a period as long as three Palyopama, which is longer than the
Purvakoti (this Purvakoti is in relation to the lifespan of a human being who
dies in Uttar Kuru and is reborn there).   **[Gestation]** The Purvakoti is in
relation to the gestation period. The death of a fetus is prohibited.  **[Hemvat
and Hairanyavat Karmabhoomi]** A human being in the Hemvat and Hairanyavat
Karmabhoomi can remain in the same form for a period ranging from a mere
Palyopama to a period as long as a full Palyopama, depending on their karmic
merit. The shortest time they can remain in the same form before death is an
Antarmuhurt. The longest time they can remain in the same form before death is a
period as long as one Palyopama, which is longer than the Purvakoti.
**[Harivarsha and Ramyakavarsha Karmabhoomi]** A human being in the Harivarsha
and Ramyakavarsha Karmabhoomi can remain in the same form for a period ranging
from two Palyopama to a period as long as two full Palyopama, depending on their
karmic merit. The shortest time they can remain in the same form before death is
an Antarmuhurt (because a human being with a lifespan shorter than an
Antarmuhurt cannot die). The longest time they can remain in the same form
before death is a period as long as two Palyopama, which is longer than the
Purvakoti.  **[Devakuru and Uttar Kuru Karmabhoomi]** A human being in the
Devakuru and Uttar Kuru Karmabhoomi can remain in the same form for a period
ranging from three Palyopama to a period as long as three full Palyopama,
depending on their karmic merit. The shortest time they can remain in the same
form before death is an Antarmuhurt. The longest time they can remain in the
same form before death is a period as long as three Palyopama, which is longer
than the Purvakoti.  **[Antarvipak]** A human being in the Antarvipak can remain
in the same form for a period ranging from an innumerable part of a Palyopama to
a period as long as an innumerable part of a full Palyopama, depending on their
karmic merit. The shortest time they can remain in the same form before death is
an Antarmuhurt. The longest time they can remain in the same form before death
is a period as long as an innumerable part of a Palyopama, which is longer than
the Purvakoti.  **[Devapurusha]** The state of the Devapurusha, as described
earlier, is also their Sanchiththana (physical state). One might question how
the Sanchiththana can be in one single birth when it is in relation to many
births and states. This is not a fault, as the intention here is only to explain
how long a Devapurusha can remain in the state of Devapurushatva without leaving
it. A Devapurusha does not become a Devapurusha in the next birth after death.
Therefore, it is an exaggeration to say that the state of the Devapurusha is
also their Sanchiththana.  **Inter-Door 55.** **[Question]** "Sir, how long is
the interval?" **[Answer]** "Just as a single moment is the time for the rising
of the sun, so is the interval."

## Second Principle: Interval  **[155]** In the same way, one should know the
interval of the **Graveyaka** celestial beings. The interval of the
**Anuttaropapatik** celestial beings is slightly more than the interval of the
**Jghanya** (lowest) celestial beings, which is a year, and the interval of the
**Utkrushta** (highest) celestial beings is like an ocean. In the previous
sutra, the time spent in the same **Paryaya** (state) was explained. This sutra
explains the time taken by a soul to regain its current **Paryaya** after
leaving it. This is called the **Antara** (interval).  Here, the **Antara** of
the **Tiryanch** (animals), **Manushya** (humans), and **Devapurush** (celestial
beings) is being discussed. Generally, after leaving the **Purusha** (male)
**Paryaya**, how long does it take for a soul to regain the **Purusha**
**Paryaya**? When asked this question by **Gautama Swami**, the Lord said,
"**Gautama**, the **Antara** of the **Jghanya** is one **Samaya** (moment) and
the **Antara** of the **Utkrushta** is **Vanaspatikala** (the time taken for a
plant to grow)."  This is explained as follows: When a man ascends to the
**Upshama** (subdued) category and subdues the **Purusha** **Veda** (knowledge),
he dies after one **Samaya** and is reborn as a **Devapurush** according to the
law. Therefore, the **Antara** is said to be one **Samaya**. Some may question
why the **Antara** of a woman or a eunuch who also ascends the categories is not
one **Samaya**. The answer is that after subduing the **Veda**, a woman or a
eunuch who dies with good **Adhyavasaya** (determination) is reborn as a
**Devapurush** according to the law, not as a **Dev** (female celestial being)
or a eunuch. Therefore, their **Antara** is not one **Samaya**.  The **Antara**
of the **Utkrushta** **Purusha** is called **Vanaspatikala**. Explaining
**Vanaspatikala**, it is said, "Countless **Utsappini** (ascending) and
**Avasappini** (descending) cycles pass in it, countless **Loka** (worlds) are
destroyed, and countless **Pudgalparavarta** (changes in matter) occur. These
**Pudgalparavarta** are equal to countless parts of the time of the
**Pravalika** (a specific time period)."  After explaining the **Antara** of a
general **Purusha**, the **Antara** of **Tiryanch** (animals) and other specific
categories is explained. The **Antara** of **Tiryanch** is **Antarmuhurta** (a
very short time) for the **Jghanya** and **Vanaspatikala** for the
**Utkrushta**. The **Antara** of **Tiryanch** women is the same as the
**Antara** of **Tiryanch** men. The **Antara** of **Jalchar** (aquatic animals),
**Sthalchar** (terrestrial animals), and **Khechar** (aerial animals) is also
**Antarmuhurta** for the **Jghanya** and **Vanaspatikala** for the
**Utkrushta**. The **Antara** of **Manushya** (human) women is the same as the
**Antara** of **Manushya** men.  Therefore, generally, the **Antara** of a
**Manushya** **Purusha** is **Antarmuhurta** for the **Jghanya** and
**Vanaspatikala** for the **Utkrushta** in terms of **Kshetra** (region). In
terms of **Dharmacharan** (religious practice), the **Antara** is one **Samaya**
for the **Jghanya** (because after accepting **Charitra** (conduct), one can
fall back and regain **Charitra** in one **Samaya**), and **Deshon Aparth
Pudgalparavarta** (half the time of a **Pudgalparavarta**) for the
**Utkrushta**.  1. "**Pranatao Ussappini Gro Prosappini Pro Kalo, Khettayyo
Ananta Loga, Asankhejjja Poggalpariyatta, Te Nan Puggalpariyatta Pravaliyae
Asankhejjai Bhago.**" (This is the time for **Utsappini** and **Avasappini**
cycles, countless **Loka** are destroyed, countless **Pudgalparavarta** occur,
and these **Pudgalparavarta** are equal to countless parts of the time of the
**Pravalika**.)

## Translation:  [156] In the same way, regarding the birth and character of
humans in the Karmābhūmi, such as Bharata, Airāvata, Pūrva-Videha, and Apara-
Videha, one should state the difference between the inferior and the superior.
The difference between the birth of a common human in the Akarmābhūmi and a
human in the Karmābhūmi is ten thousand years at the most, because after death,
he is born in the inferior category of gods, and from there, he may be born
again in the Karmābhūmi as a male or female, and then again as a human in the
Akarmābhūmi. The statement that he is born in the Karmābhūmi in between is made
because a living being does not directly become a human or a five-sensed animal
in the Akarmābhūmi after being born in the Devaloka. The difference from the
superior is the duration of a Vanaspathikalpa.  Regarding the duration of the
Sanhāra, the difference between the inferior and the superior is an Antarmūhurta
(in the case of being taken from the Akarmābhūmi to the Karmābhūmi, after being
taken in the Antarmūhurta, due to the change in intellect, he is brought back to
the same place) and a Vanaspathikalpa from the superior. After the passage of
this time, the Sanhāra also takes place according to the rule, just like the
birth in the Akarmābhūmi. In the same way, one should state the difference
between the inferior and the superior in terms of birth and Sanhāra in the
Akarmābhūmi such as Haimavata, Hairanyavata, etc.  Similarly, one should state
the difference between the inferior and the superior in terms of the duration of
the Vaktvyata of a human in the Antarvīpaka-Karmābhūmi, as before. After stating
the difference between humans, the Sūtrakara states the difference between the
Devapurusha, saying that the difference between a common Devapurusha and a
superior Devapurusha is an Antarmūhurta from the inferior and a Vanaspathikalpa
from the superior.  The difference of an Antarmūhurta is stated because after
being born in the Devaloka, he may be born again in the womb of a human after
completing the Paryāpti and then, after death, he may be born again in the
Devaloka due to his previous determination. The difference from the superior is
the duration of a Vanaspathikalpa. In this way, one should state the difference
between the gods from the Asurakumāra up to the Sahasrāra (thousandth) Devaloka.
The difference between the god of the Prānatakalpa (ninth Devaloka) and the
inferior is a Varshāprthaktva.  Because a living being who has been born in the
Ānata, etc., Kalpas, and then born again in the Prānatakalpa, etc., can only be
born there with a character (Chāritra) according to the rule (in the Manushya-
bhava). No living being can be born in the Ānata, etc., Kalpas without a
character. The character does not develop before the age of eight years,
therefore, the term Varshāprthaktva is used to indicate the difference of eight
years. The difference from the superior is the duration of a Vanaspathikalpa.
The difference between the Anuttaroppapātika Kalpātita Devapurusha and the
inferior is a Varshāprthaktva, and from the superior, it is a Sankhyeya Sāgara,
which is slightly more than the Varshāprthaktva. The difference in the number of
Sāgaras should be understood in terms of the birth in the other Vaimānika
Devalokas and the birth in the Manushya-bhavas. Although this statement is
generally applicable to all Anuttaroppapātika Devalokas, it should be understood
in relation to the Vijay, Vaijayanta, Jayanta, and Aparājita Vimānas, because
the birth in the Sarvārthasiddha Vimāna happens only once, therefore, there is
no possibility of a difference.  The Vṛttikāra, while mentioning a different
opinion regarding the difference, says that the difference between the gods from
the Bhavanavāsī up to the Iśāna Devaloka is an Antarmūhurta from the inferior,
and from the Sanatkumāra up to the Sahasrāra, etc.

##  [155 Second Rebirth: Fewness]  The difference between the Janya Antaras is
nine days, from the Panatkalpa to the Achyutkalpa is nine months, and the
difference between the nine Veyakas and the remaining Anuttaroppapatik Devas,
excluding Sarvarthasiddha, is nine years. The difference between the Utkrushta
Antaras is the lifespan of a plant, up to the Veyaka. In the four Mahavimanas,
Vijayadi, the difference between the two Sagaropama Utkrushta Antaras is...
**Fewness 56.**  "Bhagavan, are there few or many of these beings, or are they
equal, or are there differences?  "Gotama, the Vimana Devas are countless, the
Bhavana Vasi Devas are countless, the Bana Mantara Devas are countless, and the
Jotisya Devas are countless.  "Bhagavan, are there few or many of these beings,

Akammabhumga, the Antaradovaga, the Deva Purisas, the Bhavana Vasi, the Bana
Mantara, the Jotisya, the Vimana, the Sohammana, and the Sarvatthasiddha?
"Gotama, the Antaradovaga Manussapurisa, the Deva Kuru Uttara Kuru Kammabhumga

## Second Proposition: Alpabahutva [159 Bahutva has been explained / In which
the first, taking Tiryanch, Manushya and Deva Purushas as common, the second
taking Tiryanch Yonic Jalchar, Sthalchar, Khechar Purushas, the third taking
three types of Manushyas like Karmabhumik, the fourth taking four types of Devas
and the fifth taking all of them mixed, Alpabahutva has been explained. The
first three Alpabahutvas are like the way they have been said taking their
women, in the same way, it should be said taking men here. These three
Alpabahutvas have been taken here by the word 'Yavat'. It should be seen in the
Alpabahutva of the Stri Prakaran / The only difference is that the word 'Purush'
should be used in place of 'Stri'. The fourth Deva Purush related Alpabahutva
has been directly said by the Sutrakar in the present Sutra / It is as follows -
The least are the Anuttaroppapatik Deva Purushas, because their measure is equal
to the amount of Akash Pradeshas of the Asankhyey Bhagavarti Kshetrapalyopama /
The Aveyak Deva Purushas above them are Sankhyeyguna / Because they are the
measure of the amount of Akash Pradeshas of the Asankhyey Bhagavarti Brihattar
Kshetrapalyopama. The number of Vimanas is Sankhyeyguna. There are five Vimanas
of the Anuttar Devas and one hundred Vimanas of the Graveyak Devas above them.
There are Asankhyey Devas in each Vimana. As the Vimanas are lower, the number
of Devas in them is abundant. From this, it is known that the Graveyak Deva
Purushas above the Anuttar Vimana Deva Purushas are Sankhyeyguna. The Madhyam
Graveyak Deva Purushas are Sankhyeyguna compared to the Aveyak Deva Purushas
above them / The Aveyak Deva Purushas below them are Sankhyeyguna, the
Achyutkalp Deva Purushas are Sankhyeyguna from them. The Aranakalp Deva Purushas
are Sankhyeyguna from them. It is to be known here that although both Aran and
Achyut Kalp are of the same series and have the same number of Vimanas, still
the Krishnapakshik Jivas and by nature are born in the South direction in more
form. Jivas are of two types - Krishnapakshik and Shuklapakshik / Those Jivas
who have a little less Arghpudgalparavart Sansar left are Shuklapakshik. Those
with a longer Sansar than this are Krishnapakshik. 'Krishnapakshiks are less
than Shuklapakshiks. Alpasansari Jivas are few / Krishnapakshiks are many,
because the Dirghsansari Jivas are Anantanant / _ There may be a doubt that how
can it be considered that Krishnapakshiks are born abundantly in the South
direction? Acharyas have said that this happens naturally. Krishnapakshiks are
mostly Dirghsansari and Dirghsansaris are mostly born from the rise of many
Papkarma. Jivas who have the rise of many Papas are mostly cruel karma and cruel
karma Jivas are mostly born in the South direction even though they are
Bhavasiddhik by nature / Therefore, due to the abundance of Krishnapakshiks in
the South direction, the Aranakalp Deva Purushas are Sankhyeyguna compared to
the Achyutkalp Deva Purushas / 1. Jesimvaddo Pumgalpariyatto Sesho Ya Sansaro.

## Translation:  [160] The Devapurusha (divine beings) of the Pranatkalpa are
innumerable times more than the Devapurusha of the Jeevajeevaabhigamsutra
Aranakalpa. The Devapurusha of the Anatkalpa are innumerable times more than
those of the Pranatkalpa. Here too, the Devapurusha of the Pranatkalpa are
innumerable times more than those of the Pranatkalpa because there are more
Krishnapakshika (dark fortnight) births in the southern direction of the
Pranatkalpa. All the Uttaraavasi (northern) Devas and the Devas residing in the
Pranatkalpa are equal to the number of Aakashapradesha (regions of space) in
each Kshetrapalyopam (a specific region of space) multiplied by an innumerable
number. Only the innumerable parts are of innumerable types, therefore there is
no contradiction in the aforementioned innumerability. The Devapurusha of the
Sahasraarkalpa are innumerable times more than the Devapurusha of the Anatkalpa
because they are equal to the number of Aakashapradesha in an innumerable part
of a regional category of the Ghanikritaloka (dense world). The Devapurusha of
the Mahashukrakalpa are innumerable times more than those of the Sahasraarkalpa
because they are equal to the number of Aakashapradesha in an innumerable part
of a larger category. This innumerability should be understood from the
abundance of Vimana (aerial chariots). The number of Vimana in the
Sahasraarkalpa is six thousand, while in the Mahashukrakalpa there are forty
thousand Vimana. The lower Vimana have more Devapurusha than the higher ones.
The Devapurusha of the Lantkalpa are innumerable times more than those of the
Mahashukrakalpa because they are equal to the number of Aakashapradesha in an
innumerable part of the largest category. The Devapurusha of the Brahmaloka are
innumerable times more than those of the Lantkalpa because they are equal to the
number of Aakashapradesha in an innumerable part of a larger category. The
Devapurusha of the Mahendrakalpa are innumerable times more than those of the
Brahmaloka because they are equal to the number of Aakashapradesha in an
innumerable part of an even larger category. The Devas of the Sanatkumarakalpa
are innumerable times more than those of the Mahendrakalpa because of the
abundance of Vimana. There are twelve lakh Vimana in the Sanatkumarakalpa and
eight lakh Vimana in the Mahendrakalpa. Another reason is that the
Sanatkumarakalpa is in the southern direction and the Mahendrakalpa is in the
northern direction. There are many Krishnapakshika births in the southern
direction, therefore the Devapurusha of the Sanatkumarakalpa are innumerable
times more than those of the Mahendrakalpa. The Devas from the Sahasraarkalpa to
the Sanatkumarakalpa are equal to the number of Aakashapradesha in an
innumerable part of a category of the Ghanikritaloka in their respective
locations, but since the innumerable parts of the category are of innumerable
types, there is no contradiction in saying that they are innumerable times more.
The Devapurusha of the Ishanakalpa are innumerable times more than those of the
Sanatkumarakalpa because they are equal to the number of Aakashapradesha in
thirty-two parts of a regional category of the Ghanikritaloka, which is obtained
by multiplying the square root of the region of space of an angul (finger width)
by its cube root. The Devapurusha of the Saudharmakalpa are innumerable times
more than those of the Ishanakalpa. This should be understood from the abundance
of Vimana. There are twenty-eight lakh Vimana in the Ishanakalpa and thirty-two
lakh Vimana in the Saudharmakalpa. Another reason is that the Saudharmakalpa is
in the southern direction and the Ishanakalpa is in the northern direction.
Krishnapakshika births are naturally more in the southern direction, therefore
the Devas of the Saudharmadevloka are innumerable times more than those of the
Ishanadevloka. There is a doubt here that the same logic has been mentioned for
the Sanatkumarakalpa and the Mahendrakalpa. Then, there it has been said that
the number of Devas in the Sanatkumarakalpa is innumerable times more than those
in the Mahendrakalpa, and here it has been said that the number of Devas in the

## Second Consideration: Alpabahutva [161]  Why is the number of *Ishaan*
considered as the proof? The answer is that it is so by nature. This is stated
in all the scriptures like *Prajnaapana* etc.  The *Bhavanaaasi* Devas are
countless times more than the *Soudharma* Devas. Because, the number of *Aakash
Pradesh* in one *Pradeshika* category of the dense *Lok* is equal to the square
root of the square root of the *Pradesh* quantity of an area of one *Angul*
(finger width). The *Bhavanaaasi* Devas are 32 times more than this number.  The
*Vyantar* Devas are countless times more than the *Bhavanaaasi* Devas. Because,
the number of *Khand* in one *Pradeshika* category is equal to the number of
*Kodaakodi* *Yojan* in one *Pratar*. The *Vyantar* Devas are 32 times more than
this number.  The *Jyotishk* Devas are countless times more than the *Vyantar*
Devas. Because, the number of *Khand* in one *Pratar* is equal to the number of
*Pradeshika* categories in 256 *Angul*. The *Jyotishk* Devas are 32 times more
than this number.  Now, the fifth *Alpabahutva* is the least number of
*Antarveepik* humans. Because, their area is small. The humans of *Devakuru* and
*Uttarakuru* are countless times more than them, because their area is large.
Both are equal in their respective places, because their areas are equal.  The
humans of *Harivarsh* and *Ramyakavarsh* are countless times more than the
humans of *Devakuru* and *Uttarakuru*, because their area is much larger. Both
are equal in their respective places, because their areas are equal.  The humans
of *Haemvat* and *Haranvavt* are countless times more than the humans of
*Harivarsh* and *Ramyakavarsh*, because even though their area is small, their
abundance is due to the smallness of their location. Both are equal in their
respective places.  The humans of *Bharat* and *Airavat* *Karmabhoomi* are
countless times more than the humans of *Haemvat* and *Haranvavt*, because
during the time of *Ajit* Prabhu, there is naturally an abundance of humans in
the highest position. Both are equal in their respective places, because their
areas are equal.  The humans of *Purva Videh* and *Paschim Videh* are countless
times more than the humans of *Bharat* and *Airavat* *Karmabhoomi*, because
their area is large and naturally there is an abundance of humans during the
time of *Ajit* Swami. Both are equal in their respective places.  The
*Anuttaroppaatik* Devas are countless times more than the humans of *Purva
Videh* and *Paschim Videh*. Because, they are equal to the number of *Aakash
Pradesh* in countless parts of the *Kshetrapalyopama*.  The *Uparitan Aveyak*
Devas, *Madhyam Aveyak* Devas, *Adhastan Greveyak* Devas, *Achyutkalp* Devas,
*Paranakalp* Devas, *Pranatakalp* Devas, and *Anatakalp* Devas are countless
times more than the *Anuttaroppaatik* Devas, in that order.  The
*Sahasraarakalp* Devas, *Lantakalp* Devas, *Brahmalokkalp* Devas,
*Maheendrakalp* Devas, *Sanatkumarakalp* Devas, and *Ishaanakalp* Devas are
countless times more than the previous Devas, in that order.  The
*Soudharmakalp* Devas are countless times more than the *Ishaanakalp* Devas.
The *Bhavanaaasi* Devas are countless times more than the *Soudharmakalp* Devas.
The *Khechar* *Tiryanch* *Yoni* are countless times more than the *Bhavanaaasi*
Devas. Because, they are equal to the number of *Aakash Pradesh* in countless
parts of countless *Shreni* in one *Pratar*.

## 162] The number of terrestrial beings is multiplied by the number of aquatic
beings, and that product is multiplied by the number of Vānavyantara Devas. This
is because the number of Vānavyantara Devas is equal to the number of yojana-
kotis in one pratar, which is the measure of one pradeshika श्रेणी, divided by
32. This number is then multiplied by the number of Jyotishka Devas. The method
has been explained before.  **The state of the Purushaveda** 57. "O Bhagavan,
how long is the state of bondage for the Purushaveda?" "Gautama, the lowest
state of bondage is eight years, and the highest state is ten koḍakoḍi
sāgaropamas. There is a period of one thousand years of uninterrupted time. The
state without uninterrupted time is karma-niṣeka (ready for fruition)." "O
Bhagavan, how is the Purushaveda described?" "Gautama, it is described as being
like a forest fire." This is the full right of the Purusha. [57]  The discussion
is about the lowest state of the Purushaveda, which is eight years, because
there are no karmas that are worthy of bondage for a Purushaveda in a state
lower than this. The highest state is ten koḍakoḍi sāgaropamas. The state is
described in two ways: (1) as it exists in the form of karma, and (2) as it is
experienced. The state that is described here is the state of karma-pravṛtti.
The state that is experienced is the state without uninterrupted time. No karma
can bear fruit without the completion of uninterrupted time. The measure of
uninterrupted time is explained as follows: the uninterrupted time for a karma
is equal to the number of koḍakoḍi sāgaropamas in its highest state. The highest
state of the Purushaveda is ten koḍakoḍi sāgaropamas, so its uninterrupted time
is ten hundred (one thousand) years. The state without uninterrupted time is the
state that is experienced, which is karma-niṣeka, meaning the special
arrangement for the karma-dalikas to enter the udya-avali. The Purushaveda is
described as being like a forest fire, meaning that it is initially intense with
the fire of desire, but it quickly becomes extinguished.  **The description of
the Napumsaka** 58. "What is a Napumsaka?" "A Napumsaka is described in three
ways: (1) Neraya Napumsaka, (2) Tirikṣajoniya Napumsaka, and (3) Manusṣajoniya
Napumsaka."

## Second Rebirth: The State of Eunuchs [165]  There are five types of eunuchs
with one sense organ - Earth-bodied, Water-bodied, Fire-bodied, Air-bodied and
Plant-bodied eunuchs. There are many types of eunuchs with two, three and four
sense organs. All the distinctions mentioned in the first rebirth should be
mentioned here. There are three types of five-sense organ eunuchs in the animal
realm - aquatic eunuchs, terrestrial eunuchs and aerial eunuchs. Their sub-types
should be mentioned according to the first rebirth. The authority of the
*Prasalika* should not be mentioned. Because *Prasalika* are sometimes born in
the *Skandhavara* etc. of the Chakravarti and have a lifespan of only a moment,
therefore their mention here is not necessary. There are three types of human
eunuchs - *Karmabhumik*, *Akarmabhumik* and *Antarvipik* eunuchs. Their
distinctions should be mentioned according to the first rebirth.  The state of
eunuchs 56. [1]  "O Venerable! How long does the *Nasaga* remain in this state?"
"O Venerable! For a moment, with an increase of thirty *Sagarovama*."  "O
Venerable! How long does the *Raya* eunuch remain in this state?"  "O Venerable!
For thousands of years, with an increase of thirty *Sagarovama*."  "O Venerable!
How long does the eunuch in the animal realm remain in this state?"  "O
Venerable! For a moment, with an increase of *Punya Koti*."  "O Venerable! How
long does the one-sense organ eunuch in the animal realm remain in this state?"
"O Venerable! For a moment, with an increase of twenty-two thousand years."  "O
Venerable! How long does the one-sense organ eunuch in the animal realm with
further development remain in this state?"  "O Venerable! For a moment, with an
increase of twenty-two thousand years."  "O Venerable! The duration of all one-
sense organ eunuchs should be mentioned in this way."  "O Venerable! The
duration of two-sense organ, three-sense organ and four-sense organ eunuchs
should be mentioned in this way."  "O Venerable! How long does the five-sense
organ eunuch in the animal realm remain in this state?"  "O Venerable! For a
moment, with an increase of *Punya Koti*."  "O Venerable! In this way, for all
aquatic, aerial, four-footed, aquatic-snake, terrestrial-snake, aerial-animal
realm eunuchs, the duration is a moment with an increase of *Punya Koti*."  "O
Venerable! How long does the human eunuch remain in this state?"

## Second Rebirth: The State of the Eunuch [167]  **Discussion:** After
explaining the various types of eunuchs and their rights, this sutra describes
their state. Generally, the lowest state of an eunuch is an instant
(antarmuhurt) and the highest is thirty-three oceans (tetis sagaropama). The
lowest state of an instant is in comparison to a human eunuch, and the highest
state of thirty-three oceans is in comparison to a eunuch in the seventh earth
hell (saptamaprithvi narak).  **Specific Explanation:** This refers to the state
of the hell eunuchs. Generally, the lowest state of a hell eunuch is ten
thousand years and the highest is thirty-three oceans. In specific explanation,
the state of the eunuchs in different hell earths is as follows:  | Hell Earth |
Eunuch | Lowest State | Highest State | |---|---|---|---| | Ratnaprabhanarak |
Ratnaprabhanarak Eunuch | Ten thousand years | One ocean | | Sharkaraprabhanarak
| Sharkaraprabhanarak Eunuch | One ocean | Three oceans | | Balukaprabhanarak |
Balukaprabhanarak Eunuch | Three oceans | Seven oceans | | Pankaprabhanarak |
Pankaprabhanarak Eunuch | Seven oceans | Ten oceans | | Dhumpaprabhanarak |
Dhumpaprabhanarak Eunuch | Ten oceans | Seventeen oceans | | Namahprabhanarak |
Namahprabhanarak Eunuch | Seventeen oceans | Twenty-two oceans | |
Adhasaptamanarak | Adhasaptamanarak Eunuch | Twenty-two oceans | Thirty-three
oceans |  Generally, the lowest state of a transmigratory eunuch (tiryanch) is
an instant and the highest is the previous birth (purvakoti). The state of
transmigratory eunuchs is as follows:  | Type of Transmigratory Eunuch | Lowest
State | Highest State | |---|---|---| | One-sense eunuch (ekendriya) | Instant |
Twenty-two thousand years | | Earth-bodied eunuch (prithvikaaya) | Twenty-two
thousand years | Seven thousand years | | Fire-bodied eunuch (tejaskaaya) |
Three days | Three thousand years | | Air-bodied eunuch (vayukaaya) | Three
thousand years | Ten thousand years | | Plant-bodied eunuch (vanaspatikaaya) |
Ten thousand years | Twelve years | | Two-sense eunuch (dvendriya) | Twelve
years | Fifty days | | Three-sense eunuch (triendriya) | Fifty days | Six months
| | Four-sense eunuch (chaturindriya) | Six months | Previous birth | | Five-
sense eunuch (panchendriya) | Previous birth | Previous birth |  Transmigratory
eunuchs include aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial beings.

## Second Chapter: Interval [171]  The lifespan of a two-sense neuter being is
from an antarmukha (instant) at the lowest to a sankhyatkal (countable time) at
the highest. This sankhyatkal should be understood as a countable thousand
years. Similarly, the lifespan of three-sense and four-sense neuter beings
should also be stated.  The lifespan of a five-sense tiryanch neuter being is
from an antarmukha at the lowest to a purvakotiprithaktva (separation from the
previous koti) at the highest. In this, seven bhava (existences) are
continuously experienced in relation to the neuter bhava of the purvakoti
lifespan. After this, there is definitely a change in ved (knowledge) and bhava.
Similarly, it should be understood in the case of aquatic, terrestrial, and
aerial neuter beings. Generally, the lifespan of a human neuter being is also
the same - from an antarmukha at the lowest to a purvakotiprithaktva at the
highest.  The lifespan of a human neuter being in the karmabhoomi (sphere of
action) is from an antarmukha at the lowest to a purvakotiprithaktva at the
highest, depending on the region. Depending on the practice of dharma
(righteousness), it is from one time at the lowest to a purvakoti at the
highest, depending on the country. The feeling is the same as before.
Similarly, the lifespan of a human neuter being in the Bharat-Airavat
karmabhoomi and the lifespan of a human neuter being in the Purva-Videha and
Paschim-Videha karmabhoomi should also be known.  Generally, the lifespan of a
human neuter being in the akarmabhoomi (sphere of inaction) is from an
antarmukha at the lowest, depending on birth. In this much time, they experience
birth and death many times. At the highest, it is an antarmukhaprithaktva. After
this, there is no birth for them there. Depending on the destruction, it is from
an antarmukha at the lowest to a purvakoti at the highest, depending on the
country.  The lifespan of human neuter beings in the Haimvat, Hairanyavat,
Harivarsha, Ramyakavarsha, Devakuru, Uttar Kuru, and Antardeepik should also be
known in the same way. This is the description of lifespan.  ## Interval [3]
**Monk:** "O Venerable One! What is the interval of time for a neuter being?"
**Gotama:** "From an antarmukha at the lowest to a sagaropama sahasra (thousand
like oceans) at the highest, with excess."  **Monk:** "O Venerable One! What is
the interval of time for a geriya (earth) neuter being?"  **Gotama:** "From an
antarmukha at the lowest to a tarukala (tree time) at the highest."  **Monk:**
"O Venerable One! What is the interval of time for a neraya (hell) neuter being
in the rayanpraphapudhvi (rayanprapha earth)?"  **Gotama:** "From an antarmukha
at the lowest to a tarukala at the highest."  **Gotama:** "Similarly, for all of
them, until the adhesatma (highest being)."  **Monk:** "O Venerable One! What is
the interval of time for a tiryanch neuter being?"  **Gotama:** "From an
antarmukha at the lowest to a sagaropama sahasra at the highest, with excess."
**Monk:** "O Venerable One! What is the interval of time for a one-sense
tiryanch neuter being?"  **Gotama:** "From an antarmukha at the lowest to two
sagaropama sahasra (thousand like oceans) at the highest, countable time, with
excess."  **Gotama:** "From an antarmukha at the lowest to a vanassaikala
(forest time) at the highest, for the earth, water, fire, and wind."
**Gotama:** "From an antarmukha at the lowest to an asankhyeya (innumerable)
time at the highest, for the vanassaikala, until innumerable loka (worlds)."
**Gotama:** "From an antarmukha at the lowest to a vanassaikala at the highest,
for the rest, from two-sense beings to six-sense beings."

[172] [The Sutra of Jivaji's Approach] A human being who is a neuter (napumsaka)
has a difference in time from the lowest to the highest, from an antarmukha (a
very short time) to a vanaspatikala (a time as long as a tree lives). A person
who practices Dharma (dharmacharan) has a difference in time from the lowest to
the highest, from one moment to an infinite time, until the time of the
destruction of the half-pudgala (ardha-pudgala-paravarta).  /  The same applies
to the human being who is a neuter (napumsaka) in the realm of karma
(karmabhumika), as well as the human being who is a neuter (napumsaka) in the
realms of Bharata, Eravata, Purva-Videha, and Paschima-Videha.  /  O Venerable
One! What is the difference in time for a human being who is a neuter
(napumsaka) in the realm of no karma (akarmabhumika)?  /  Gautama! From the
lowest to the highest, from an antarmukha to a vanaspatikala.  /  From the
lowest to the highest, from an antarmukha to a vanaspatikala, and so on until
the time of the destruction of the inter-island (antar-divika) neuter
(napumsaka).  /  [59] (3) O Bhagavan! What is the difference in time for a
neuter (napumsaka)?  /  Gautama! From the lowest to the highest, from an
antarmukha to a time slightly longer than a hundred sagaropama (a time as long
as a sea)  /  O Bhagavan! What is the difference in time for a neuter
(napumsaka) in the realm of hell (nairyika)?  /  Gautama! From the lowest to the
highest, from an antarmukha to a vanaspatikala.  /  The difference in time for a
neuter (napumsaka) in the realm of hell (nairyika) on the earth of Ratnaprabaha
(ratnaprabaha-prithvi) is from the lowest to the highest, from an antarmukha to
a vanaspatikala.  /  The same should be said for the neuter (napumsaka) in the
realm of hell (nairyika) on the seventh earth below (adha-saptama-prithvi).  /
The difference in time for a neuter (napumsaka) in the realm of animals (tiryak-
yoni) is from the lowest to the highest, from an antarmukha to a time slightly
longer than a hundred sagaropama.  /  The difference in time for a neuter
(napumsaka) in the realm of animals (tiryak-yoni) with one sense (ekendriya) is
from the lowest to the highest, from an antarmukha to a time slightly longer
than two thousand sagaropama, which is the number of years in a kalpa.  /  The
difference in time for a neuter (napumsaka) in the realm of fire (tejas-kaya)
and air (vayu-kaya) is from the lowest to the highest, from an antarmukha to a
vanaspatikala.  /  The difference in time for a neuter (napumsaka) in the realm
of plants (vanaspati-kaya) is from the lowest to the highest, from an antarmukha
to an infinite time, as long as an infinite number of worlds (asankeya-loka).  /
The difference in time for the remaining neuters (napumsaka) with two senses
(dwindriya) and so on, up to the neuters (napumsaka) in the realm of celestial
beings (khechara), is from the lowest to the highest, from an antarmukha to a
vanaspatikala.  /  The difference in time for a human being who is a neuter
(napumsaka) is from the lowest to the highest, from an antarmukha to a
vanaspatikala, depending on the realm (kshetra).  /  The difference in time for
a human being who is a neuter (napumsaka) is from the lowest to the highest,
from one moment to an infinite time, depending on the practice of Dharma
(dharmacharan), until the time of the destruction of the half-pudgala (ardha-
pudgala-paravarta).  /  The same applies to the human being who is a neuter
(napumsaka) in the realm of karma (karmabhumika), as well as the human being who
is a neuter (napumsaka) in the realms of Bharata, Eravata, Purva-Videha, and
Paschima-Videha.  /  O Venerable One! What is the difference in time for a human
being who is a neuter (napumsaka) in the realm of no karma (akarmabhumika)?  /
Gautama! From the lowest to the highest, from an antarmukha to a vanaspatikala.
/  From the lowest to the highest, from an antarmukha to a vanaspatikala, and so
on until the time of the destruction of the inter-island (antar-divika) neuter
(napumsaka).  /  After explaining the state of existence (bhavasthiti) and the
state of the body (kayasthiti) of the neuters (napumsaka), this Sutra describes

leaving the state of being a **napumsaka** (eunuch), how much time elapses
before becoming a **napumsaka** again. Generally, while explaining the interval
of a **napumsaka**, the Lord says, "Gautama! The interval is from an
**antarmūhurta** (a very short time) in the case of the lowest and slightly more
than a **sāgaropamashatapṛthaktva** (a hundred times the distance of an ocean)
in the case of the highest. Because the duration of **puruṣatva** (masculinity)
and **strītvā** (femininity) as obstacles is only this much. As it is said in
the **Sangrahaṇīgaṭhā**s, the interval between a woman and a **napumsaka** (in
terms of their **sāciṭṭhaṇā** (state of being) is one **samaya** (time) in the
case of the lowest and the interval between a man and a **napumsaka** (in terms
of their **sāciṭṭhaṇā**) is **sāgarapṛthaktva** (a distance of an ocean) - (by
**padakaideśe padasamudāyopachāra** (a general term for a group of words) -
**sāgaropamashatapṛthaktva** (a hundred times the distance of an ocean) in the
case of the highest."  In the general sense, the lowest interval for a
**nairyika** (hell-being) **napumsaka** is **antarmūhurta**. It is called
**antarmūhurta** because of the expectation that after emerging from the
**saptamanārakapṛthvī** (seventh hell-earth), it will stay in the
**tandulamatsya** (rice-fish) etc. **bhavas** (existences) for **antarmūhurta**
and then go back to the **saptama** (seventh) **pṛthvīnārak** (hell-earth). The
highest interval is **vanaspatikāla** (the time of a plant). This should be
understood as the expectation of staying in **nigoda** (a type of hell) for an
infinite time after emerging from the **narakabhava** (hell-existence) according
to tradition. Similarly, the interval of **napumsakas** in all seven
**narakapṛthvī**s should be understood.  In the general sense, the interval for
a **tiryakyoṇi** (animal) **napumsaka** is from **antarmūhurta** in the case of
the lowest and **sāgaropamashatapṛthaktva** in the case of the highest. The
explanation should be known as before. In the specific sense, generally, the
interval for a **ekendriya** (one-sensed) **tiryakyoṇi** **napumsaka** is from
**antarmūhurta** (because the obstacle of **dvīndriya** (two-sensed) etc. time
is only this much) and the highest is two thousand **sāgaropamas** more than a
countable number of years, because the duration of **traskāya** (body of
suffering) as an obstacle is only this much. After this much obstacle, it
becomes **ekendriya** again. The interval for a **pṛthvīkāyika** (earth-bodied)
**ekendriya** **napumsaka** is from **antarmūhurta** in the case of the lowest
and **vanaspatikāla** in the case of the highest. Similarly, the interval for
**apkaayika** (water-bodied), **tejaskaayika** (fire-bodied), and **vāyukāyika**
(air-bodied) **ekendriya** **napumsakas** should also be said. The interval for
**vanaspatikāyika** (plant-bodied) **ekendriya** **napumsakas** is from
**antarmūhurta** in the case of the lowest and **asanख्येय** (uncountable) time
in the case of the highest. This **asanख्येय** time is **asanख्येय**
**utsarpiṇī** (ascending) and **avasarpiṇī** (descending) forms in terms of time
and **asanख्येय** **loka** (world) measure in terms of space. This means that
the **asanख्येय** time is the time taken to completely remove all the regions of
**asanख्येय** **lokākāśa** (world-space) by removing one region at a time every
**samaya**. After leaving the **vanaspatibhavas** (plant-existences), the living
being can stay elsewhere for this much time in the case of the highest. After
this, the worldly living being is born again in the **vanaspatikāyika**
according to the rule. The interval for **dvīndriya** (two-sensed),
**trīndriya** (three-sensed), **caturindriya** (four-sensed), and
**pañcendriya** (five-sensed) **tiryakyoṇi** **napumsakas**, the interval for
**jalacara** (aquatic), **sthalaacara** (terrestrial), and **khecara** (aerial)
**pañcendriya** **tiryakyoṇi** **napumsakas**, and generally the interval for a
human **napumsaka** is:  1. **Ityinapumsā sāciṭṭhaṇesu purisantarey samayo u /

174 [The duration of the Jiva's association with the Jiva is from the most
insignificant moment to the infinite time / That infinite time is the plant
time, whose nature has been explained earlier. - The human being in the
Karmabhoomi is inferior to the insignificant moment and superior to the plant
time in comparison to the inner region of the Nasika. In comparison to the
practice of Dharma, the most insignificant is one time because the time of the
most insignificant attainment is only one time. Superior to the infinite time /
In this infinite time, infinite ups and downs pass and countless Lokakasha
regions are taken away. And this is as much as the Deson Ardha Pudgal Paravart /
Similarly, the region of the Bharat, Airvat, Purva Videha and Aparavideha
Karmabhoomi Napunsakas should be said to be inferior and superior in terms of
Dharmacharan. The Akarmabhoomi human Napunsak has a difference of an
insignificant moment (there is so much obstruction in going to another motion)
and a superior plant time in comparison to birth. In comparison to the
collection, the insignificant is an insignificant moment and the superior is the
plant time / Someone collected the human Napunsak of the Karmabhoomi in the
Akarmabhoomi, he became Akarmabhoomi / After a short time, due to the change of
intellect, he was again collected in the Karmabhoomi, there he was stopped for
an insignificant moment and brought back to the Akarmabhoomi, in comparison to
this, there is a difference of an insignificant moment / Superior to the plant
time / In particular, the Hemvat, Hairanyavat, Harivarsh, Ramyakavarsh,
Devakuru-Uttarakuru Akarmabhoomi human Napunsak and the Antardeepik human
Napunsak should be said to be inferior and superior in comparison to birth and
collection. The small number of Napunsakas 60. [1] Etesin Gan Bante!

## Second Chapter: The Scarcity of Eunuchs  **[177] Gautama!** The fewest
eunuchs are those who are *antarvipik* (inhabiting the inner earth). The eunuchs
of *Devakuru* and *Uttarakuru* (regions of the earth) are twice as numerous as

(regions of action) of *Purva Videha* and *Paschim Videha* are twice as numerous
as those of *Devakuru* and *Uttarakuru*.  **(5)** O Bhagavan! Among the
*nairyik* (hellish) eunuchs, the *nairyik* eunuchs of the *Ratnaprabha* earth,
and the *nairyik* eunuchs of the seventh earth downwards, among the
*tiryanchyonik* (animal) eunuchs, among the *ekendriya* (one-sensed)
*tiryanchyonik*, among the *prithvikaayik* (earth-bodied) *ekendriya*

among the *akarmabhumik* (regions of inaction) human eunuchs, and among the
*antarvipik* human eunuchs, who are fewer, more, equal, or more special than
whom?  **Gautama!** The fewest are the *nairyik* eunuchs of the seventh earth
downwards. The *nairyik* eunuchs of the sixth earth are countless times more
numerous than them. The *nairyik* eunuchs of the second earth are countless
times more numerous than those of the sixth earth. The human eunuchs of the
*antarvipik* region are countless times more numerous than those of the second
earth. The eunuchs of the *Devakuru* and *Uttarakuru* *akarmabhumik* are twice
as numerous as those of the *antarvipik* region. The eunuchs of the
*karmabhumik* of *Purva Videha* and *Paschim Videha* are twice as numerous as

eunuchs are infinitely more numerous than the *vaayukaayik* *ekendriya*
*tiryanchyonik* eunuchs.  **Discussion:** This sutra explains the scarcity in
five ways. Firstly, it describes the general scarcity of *nairyik*,
*tiryanchyonik*, and human eunuchs. Secondly, it describes the scarcity of the
seven types of *nairyik*. Thirdly, it describes the scarcity of the different
types of *tiryanchyonik* eunuchs. Fourthly, it describes the scarcity of the
different types of human beings. Fifthly, it describes a mixed scarcity of both
general and special types.  **(1)** In the first type of scarcity, it is asked
who is fewer, more, equal, or more special than whom among the *nairyik*
eunuchs, *tiryanchyonik* eunuchs, and human eunuchs. The answer is...

## Translation:  **[178]** **Jiva-jiva-abhigamsutra:** The least numerous among
the **Nairyaika** (human) **Nupunsaka** (eunuchs) are those who are in the
**Asankhyeya-bhagavarti** (incalculable parts) regions of the **Shreni**
(series) of the **Avyakta** (unmanifest) world. The **Nairyaika** **Nupunsaka**
are **Asankhyeya-guna** (incalculable times) more numerous than the **Jiva-
jiva** (living beings) **Nupunsaka**, because they are equal to the number of
**Prakash-pradesh** (regions of light) in one **Pradeshik-shreni** (series of
regions) of the **Dhanikrita-lok** (material world), which is obtained by
multiplying the square root of the number of **Pradesh** (regions) in an
**Angul-matra** (finger-width) region by its second square root. The
**Tiryanchika** (animal) **Nupunsaka** are **Ananta-guna** (infinite times) more
numerous than the **Nairyaika** **Nupunsaka**, because the **Nigoda** (animals)
are infinite. (2) The **Nairyaika** **Nupunsaka** are least numerous in the
seventh **Prithvi** (earth), because their number is equal to the number of
**Prakash-pradesh** in the **Avyakta** world, which is **Asankhyeya-bhagavarti**
(incalculable parts) of the **Prabhyantara-shreni** (inner series). The
**Nairyaika** **Nupunsaka** of the sixth **Prithvi** are **Asankhyeya-guna**
(incalculable times) more numerous than those of the seventh **Prithvi**, and so
on, with the **Nairyaika** **Nupunsaka** of each successive **Prithvi** being
**Asankhyeya-guna** (incalculable times) more numerous than those of the
previous one. This is because the number of **Nairyaika** **Nupunsaka** in each
**Prithvi** is equal to the number of **Nabha-pradesh** (regions of space) in
the **Asankhyeya-guna** (incalculable times) **Asankhyeya-guna** (incalculable
times) **Shreni** (series) of the **Avyakta** world, which is **Asankhyeya-
bhagavarti** (incalculable parts) of the **Hetubhut-shreni** (causal series) of
the previous **Nairyaika** **Nupunsaka**. The **Nairyaika** **Nupunsaka** of the
second **Prithvi** are **Asankhyeya-guna** (incalculable times) more numerous
than those of the first **Prithvi**, because their number is equal to the number
of **Prakash-pradesh** in one **Pradeshik-shreni** (series of regions) of the
**Dhanikrita-lok** (material world), which is obtained by multiplying the square
root of the number of **Pradesh** (regions) in an **Angul-matra** (finger-width)
region by its second square root. In each **Naraka-prithvi** (hellish earth),
the **Nairyaika** **Nupunsaka** in the east, north, and west directions are
equal in number, while those in the south direction are **Asankhyeya-guna**
(incalculable times) more numerous. The **Nairyaika** **Nupunsaka** in the north
and west directions of the **Prithvi**s further away from the **Prithvi**s in
the south direction are **Asankhyeya-guna** (incalculable times) more numerous
than those in the south direction of the previous **Prithvi**s. This is stated
in the **Prajnapanasutra** as well. (3) The **Tiryanchika** (animal)
**Nupunsaka** are least numerous among the **Khechara** (flying)
**Panchendriya** (five-sensed) **Tiryanchika** (animals), because their number
is equal to the number of **Prakash-pradesh** in the **Asankhyeya-shreni**
(incalculable series) of the **Avyakta** world, which is **Asankhyeya-
bhagavarti** (incalculable parts) of the **Pratara** (first). The
**Sthalachara** (land-dwelling) **Tiryanchika** (animals) are **Asankhyeya-
guna** (incalculable times) more numerous than the **Khechara** (flying)
**Tiryanchika** (animals), because their number is equal to the number of
**Prakash-pradesh** in the **Asankhyeya-shreni** (incalculable series) of the
**Avyakta** world, which is **Asankhyeya-bhagavarti** (incalculable parts) of
the **Brihattara-pratara** (larger first). The **Jalachara** (water-dwelling)
**Tiryanchika** (animals) are **Asankhyeya-guna** (incalculable times) more
numerous than the **Sthalachara** (land-dwelling) **Tiryanchika** (animals),
because their number is equal to the number of **Pradesh** (regions) in the
**Asankhyeya-shreni** (incalculable series) of the **Avyakta** world, which is
**Asankhyeya-bhagavarti** (incalculable parts) of the **Brihattama-pratara**

## Second Chapter: The Relative Scarcity of Eunuchs  **[179]** Eunuchs with four
senses (ti. yo.) are more numerous than those with three senses (ti. yo.),
because they are as numerous as the regions of space in the dense realms of
countless kotis of yojanas, which are as numerous as the regions of space in a
single regional category. Eunuchs with three senses (ti. yo.) are more numerous
than those with two senses (ti. yo.), because they are as numerous as the
regions of space in a more abundant category. Eunuchs with two senses (ti. yo.)
are more numerous than those with one sense (ti. yo.) of the luminous body,
because they are as numerous as the regions of space in the most abundant
category. Eunuchs with one sense (ti. yo.) of the luminous body are countless
times more numerous than those with one sense (ti. yo.) of the earthly body,
because they are as numerous as the regions of space in countless realms, both
subtle and gross. Eunuchs with one sense (ti. yo.) of the earthly body are more
numerous than those with one sense (ti. yo.) of the watery body, because they
are as numerous as the regions of space in countless realms. Eunuchs with one
sense (ti. yo.) of the watery body are more numerous than those with one sense
(ti. yo.) of the airy body, because they are as numerous as the regions of space
in countless realms. Eunuchs with one sense (ti. yo.) of the airy body are more
numerous than those with one sense (ti. yo.) of the vegetal body, because they
are as numerous as the regions of space in countless realms. Eunuchs with one
sense (ti. yo.) of the vegetal body are infinitely more numerous than human
eunuchs, because they are as numerous as the regions of space in infinite
realms.  **(4)** Human eunuchs are the least numerous. The least numerous are
the human eunuchs of the Antarvipija. These should be understood as a group,
because there are no womb-born human eunuchs there. They may have been collected
from the karmic realm. The human eunuchs of the Devakuru-Uttarakuru akarmabhumis
are numerous times more numerous than the human eunuchs of the Antarvipija,
because the womb-born humans there are numerous times more numerous than the
womb-born humans of the Antarvipija, because the birth of group-humans occurs
from the utterance, etc., of womb-born humans. They are equal to each other in
their respective places. The human eunuchs of the Harivarsha-Ramyakavarsha
akarmabhumis are numerous times more numerous than those of the Devakuru-
Uttarakuru, and they are equal to each other in their respective places. The
human eunuchs of the Haimavat-Hairanyavat akarmabhumis are numerous times more
numerous than those of the Harivarsha-Ramyakavarsha, and they are equal to each
other in their respective places. The human eunuchs of the Bharat-Airavat
karmabhumis are numerous times more numerous than those of the Haimavat-
Hairanyavat, and they are equal to each other in their respective places. The
human eunuchs of the Purva Videha-Paschima Videha karmabhumis are numerous times
more numerous than those of the Bharat-Airavat, and they are equal to each other
in their respective places. The same logic should be applied everywhere.

## Second Chapter: Nine Types of Minor and Major [181]  The uninterrupted period
(abādhākāla) for the Nāpusaka Veda is 2000 years. The karma-niṣeka
(fructification of karma) occurs from the state that is less than the
uninterrupted period, meaning the creation of karma-dalikas (karmic particles)
that are capable of experiencing.   O Bhagavan! How is the experience of the
Nāpusaka Veda?   O Āyushmān Śramaṇa Gautama! It is said to be like the burning
of a great city (like the burning fire of desire in all states).   The
discussion in this sūtra refers to the state of bondage (bandhasthiti) of the
Nāpusaka Veda. There are two types of states: 1. State of bondage and 2. State
capable of experiencing (capable of coming into udāya-avali kā).   The state of
bondage of the Nāpusaka Veda is 3 parts of a sāgaropama (ocean-like) less than
an innumerable part of a palyopama (mountain-like). The superior state is of
twenty kodakodi sāgaropama.   Here, the method of obtaining the inferior state,
which has been mentioned earlier, should be kept in mind. It is as follows:
The state of any nature is obtained by subtracting an innumerable part of a
palyopama from the amount obtained by dividing the superior state of mithyātva
(false belief) of that nature by seventy kodakodi sāgaropama.   Here, the
superior state of the Nāpusaka Veda is twenty kodakodi sāgaropama. Dividing it
by seventy kodakodi (zero divided by zero) results in a sāgaropama quotient.
Subtracting an innumerable part of a palyopama from this results in the inferior
state of the Nāpusaka Veda.   The uninterrupted period (abādhākāla) of the
Nāpusaka Veda is two thousand years. The rule for obtaining the uninterrupted
period is that the uninterrupted period of a karma-prakriti (karmic nature) is
one hundred years for every kodakodi sāgaropama of its superior state. The
uninterrupted period of the Nāpusaka Veda, which has a superior state of twenty
kodakodi sāgaropama, is twenty hundred years, i.e., two thousand years.   The
state that remains after subtracting the uninterrupted period from the state of
bondage is the one that gives its fruit to the jīva (living being), i.e., it
experiences it in udāya (arising). Therefore, the karma-niṣeka (fructification
of karma) occurs from the remaining state that is less than the uninterrupted
period, meaning the creation of karma-dalikas (karmic particles) that are
capable of experiencing. The karma-dalikas begin to arise in udāya (arising).
After the question regarding the state of bondage of the Nāpusaka Veda, Gautama
Svāmī asked how the experience of the Nāpusaka Veda is. In response, the Lord
said, "O Āyushmān Śramaṇa Gautama! The experience of the Nāpusaka Veda is like
the burning of a great city. Just as the flames of a fire that has spread
throughout a great city burn for a long time and are intense, so too is the fire
of desire of the Nāpusaka intense and burns for a long time. It remains intense
in all states, from beginning to middle to end."   Thus, the chapter on the
Nāpusaka is complete.   Nine Types of Minor and Major _62. [1] "O Bhagavan! In
women, men, and Nāpusakas, what is considered minor, major, equal, or special?"

Of the human beings, what is the difference between those who have a karma-
bhoomi and those who do not have a karma-bhoomi? What is the difference between
human males who have a karma-bhoomi and those who do not have a karma-bhoomi?
What is the difference between human females who have a karma-bhoomi and those
who do not have a karma-bhoomi? Is it less, more, equal, or Vishesahiya?
Gotama! The human beings who have a karma-bhoomi and the human males who have a
karma-bhoomi are equal in number. The human beings who have a karma-bhoomi and
the human males who have a karma-bhoomi in the Devakuru and Uttar Kuru are equal
in number, Sankhejjaguna. The human beings who have a karma-bhoomi and the human
males who have a karma-bhoomi in the Harivas, Rammyavas, and Prakamma-bhoomi are
equal in number, Sankhejjaguna. The human beings who have a karma-bhoomi and the
human males who have a karma-bhoomi in the Hemavat and Heranyavat are equal in
number, Sankhejjaguna. The human males who have a karma-bhoomi in the
Bharheravat are equal in number, Sankhejjaguna. The human beings who have a
karma-bhoomi in the Bharheravat are equal in number, Sankhejjaguna. The human
males who have a karma-bhoomi in the Pugyavibeh and Avar Videh are equal in
number, Sankhejjaguna. The human beings who have a karma-bhoomi in the
Pugyavibeh and Avar Videh are equal in number, Sankhejjaguna. The human females
who have a karma-bhoomi are Asankhejjaguna. The human females who have a karma-
bhoomi in the Devakuru and Uttar Kuru are equal in number, Sankhejjaguna.
Similarly, the human females who have a karma-bhoomi in the Puvva Videh are
equal in number, Sankhejjaguna. [8]  Thus, Venerable One! Of the Devas, what is
the difference between those who reside in Bhavanavasi, Vanamantari, Joisini,
and Vamanino? What is the difference between the Deva males who reside in
Bhavanavasi, Vanamantari, Joisini, and Vamanino, who are Sohammaka, Gevejjaka,
Anuttarovawaiya, and Neraiya? What is the difference between the Neraiya females
who reside in Rayapphaba-Pudhavi, Neraiya females who reside in Ahesattama-
Pudhavi, and Neraiya females who reside in other Pudhavis? Is it less, more,
equal, or Vishesahiya?  Gotama! The Deva males who are Anuttarovawaiya are equal
in number. The Deva males who are Uvarima Gevenja are Sankhejjaguna. Similarly,
the Deva males who are in the Aanaa Kappe are Sankhejjaguna. The Neraiya females
who reside in the Ahesattama Pudhavi are Asankhejjaguna. The Neraiya females who
reside in the Chatthi Pudhavi are Sankhejjaguna. The Deva males who are in the
Sahassara Kappe are Sankhejjaguna. The Devas who are in the Mahasukke Kappe are

are equal to each other and the fewest.

## Second Chapter: Nine Types of Minor Abundance  **[191]**  There are more
female terrestrial *tiryakyonika* than male terrestrial *tiryakyonika*. There
are more male aquatic *tiryakyonika* than female aquatic *tiryakyonika*. There
are more female aquatic *tiryakyonika* than *vanavyantara* male gods. There are
more *vanavyantara* female gods than *jyotishka* male gods. There are more
*jyotishka* female gods than *khechara* five-sensed *tiryakyonika* eunuchs.
There are more terrestrial *tiryakyonika* eunuchs than aquatic *tiryakyonika*
eunuchs. There are more four-sensed eunuchs than three-sensed eunuchs. There are
more three-sensed eunuchs than two-sensed eunuchs. There are more luminous one-
sensed *tiryakyonika* eunuchs than earth-bodied one-sensed *tiryakyonika*
eunuchs. There are more earth-bodied one-sensed *tiryakyonika* eunuchs than
formless one-sensed *tiryakyonika* eunuchs. There are more formless one-sensed
*tiryakyonika* eunuchs than air-bodied one-sensed *tiryakyonika* eunuchs. There
are more air-bodied one-sensed *tiryakyonika* eunuchs than plant-bodied one-
sensed *tiryakyonika* eunuchs.  **Discussion:** This sutra describes nine types
of minor abundance.   (1) The first type of minor abundance considers the
general abundance of females, males, and eunuchs.   (2) The second type of minor
abundance considers the general abundance of female, male, and eunuch
*tiryakyonika*.   (3) The third type of minor abundance considers the general
abundance of female, male, and eunuch humans.   (4) The fourth type of minor
abundance considers the general abundance of female gods, male gods, and hellish
eunuchs. There are no eunuchs among gods, and hell beings are only eunuchs.
Therefore, the minor abundance of hellish eunuchs is compared with female and
male gods.   (5) The fifth type of minor abundance considers the general
abundance of all the aforementioned beings combined.   (6) The sixth type of
minor abundance considers the specific abundance of female, male, and eunuch
*tiryakyonika* (in comparison to their different categories).   (7) The seventh
type of minor abundance considers the specific abundance of female, male, and
eunuch humans (in comparison to their different categories).   (8) The eighth
type of minor abundance considers the specific abundance of female gods, male
gods, and hellish eunuchs (in comparison to their different categories).   (9)
The ninth type of minor abundance considers the combined minor abundance of all
the different categories of female, male, and eunuch *tiryakyonika*, humans, and
gods.   The *Malayagirivritti* mentions only eight types of minor abundance. The
first type of minor abundance, which considers the general abundance of females,
males, and eunuchs, is not mentioned in the *vritti*. The *vrittikara* begins
the discussion of minor abundance with the text "Eyasim gan bhanta!
Tirikhkajoniya itthina."

[192] The explanation of the principle of *alpabahutva* (fewness and manyness)
in the *jivajivaabhigamsutra* is clear from the original meaning itself, and all
types of living beings have been explained and proven in detail in previous
contexts. Therefore, it is unnecessary to repeat it here. The situation of
women, men, and eunuchs as a community is as follows: [63] "O Bhagavan! How long
is the state of women said to be?" "Gautama! The statement 'from one
perspective' etc., which was made in the case of women, should be said here as
well. Similarly, the situation of men and eunuchs should be understood in the
same way as before. The *sanchittana* (physical state) of all three and the
difference between them should also be stated here (as a community) in the same
way as it was stated in their respective contexts." The present sutra is a
compilation of the descriptions of the time-state (state of existence),
*sanchittana* (physical state), and difference etc. of women, men, and eunuchs,
which were previously described in separate contexts. The statement made in the
previous contexts is intended to be stated here as a community, so there is no
question of repetition. The commentator has considered the text here to be the
same as the first *alpabahutva* given in the previous sutra related to
*alpabahutva*. It is as follows: "O Bhagavan! How many women, men, and eunuchs
are there in the world, who are either few or many? All men are many, women are
countless, and eunuchs are infinite." Since the above *alpabahutva* mentions
women, men, and eunuchs as a community, the commentator has included it in the
community context. This particular text is relevant here because of the
community situation, *sanchittana*, difference, and community *alpabahutva*.
However, due to the similarity of *alpabahutva*, the text has been given in the
previous sutra as the first *alpabahutva* along with the *alpabahutvas*. Thus,
there is only a difference in location, not in meaning. The abundance of women
over men: [64] "The number of *tirikkhja* (non-human) women is three times that
of *tirikkhja* men. The number of *massithya* (human) women is twenty-seven
times that of *manussapurisa* (human) men. The number of *devi* (divine) women
is thirty-two times that of *devapurisa* (divine) men. These three types of
living beings are said to be present in the world. There is a difference in
their number, their *sanchittana*, and their *alpabahutva*. Their *vevana*
(karma) and *bandha* (bondage) are also different. What is the reason for this?"
// 1 // "These three types of living beings are said to be present in the
world."

## Second Proposition: The Superiority of Women over Men  [193 [64] Women in the
animal realm are three times and three forms more than men in the animal realm.
Human women are twenty-seven times and twenty-seven forms more than human men.
Divine women are thirty-two times and thirty-two forms more than divine men.
Thus, the three types of beings who end the cycle of existence have been
explained. (Collected Verse)  This second proposition, which is based on the
three Vedas, first deals with the difference in authority. Then it discusses the
state, accumulation, difference, and scarcity of authority. After that, it
describes the state of bondage of the Vedas and the nature of their experience.
**Discussion:** It was previously stated that women are more numerous than men.
A natural question arises: how much more numerous are they? This sutra answers
this question. Women in the animal realm are three times more numerous than men
in the animal realm. The word "guna" can also mean "quality," so the phrase
"three forms more" is added for clarity. Here, "guna" refers to number. Human
women are twenty-seven times more numerous than human men, and divine women are
thirty-two times more numerous than divine men.  At the end of this second
proposition, a verse is given to summarize the topic. It states that this second
proposition, which deals with the three Vedas, first discusses the difference,
then the state, accumulation (body state), difference, and scarcity in
succession. After that, it discusses the state of bondage of the Vedas and the
nature of their experience.   **OC 1.**  Women in the animal realm are three
times and three forms more than men. Human women are twenty-seven times and
twenty-seven forms more than human men. Divine women are thirty-two times and
thirty-two forms more than divine men. This is the knowledge given by the Jinas
regarding the passions and aversions of the soul.

The third attainment in the fourfold attainment has discussed the three types of
beings who have attained liberation from the cycle of birth and death. Now, the
third attainment in the sequence is discussing the four types of beings who have
attained liberation from the cycle of birth and death. Its initial aphorism is
as follows:  **Four types of beings who have attained liberation from the cycle
of birth and death** 65. Those who say that there are four types of beings who
have attained liberation from the cycle of birth and death, they state it as
follows: namely, **Nairyika**, **Tiryachyonika**, **Manushya**, and **Deva**.
[65]  **What is the nature of Nairyika?** Nairyika are said to be of seven
types, namely: **Prathama-Pruthvi-Nairyika**, **Dvitiya-Pruthvi-Nairyika**,
**Tartiya-Pruthvi-Nairyika**, **Chaturtha-Pruthvi-Nairyika**, **Panchama-
Pruthvi-Nairyika**, **Shashtha-Pruthvi-Nairyika**, and **Saptama-Pruthvi-
Nairyika**. [66]  **O Bhagavan! What is the name and lineage of the first
earth?** Gautama! The name of the first earth is **Dhamma** and its lineage is
**Ratnaprabha**. [67]  **O Bhagavan! What is the name and lineage of the second
earth?**

## Third Rebirth: Four Types of World-Ending Beings  [195] Gautama! The name of
the second earth is Vansa and its gotra is Sharkaraprabha. In this way, you
should ask questions about all the earths. Their names are as follows: the name
of the third earth is Shaila, the name of the fourth earth is Anjana, the name
of the fifth earth is Ristha, the name of the sixth earth is Magha, and the name
of the seventh earth is Maghavati.   The gotra of the third earth is
Balukaprabha, the gotra of the fourth earth is Pankaprabha, the gotra of the
fifth earth is Dhumarprabha, the gotra of the sixth earth is Tamahprabha, and
the gotra of the seventh earth is Tamas-tamahprabha.  [68] Venerable one! How
thick is this Ratnapraba earth said to be? Gautama! This Ratnapraba earth is one
lakh eighty thousand yojanas thick. In the same way, the thickness of the
remaining earths should be known from this gatha:  "The first earth is one lakh
eighty thousand yojanas thick. The second earth is one lakh thirty-two thousand
yojanas thick. The third earth is one lakh twenty-eight thousand yojanas thick.
The fourth earth is one lakh twenty thousand yojanas thick. The fifth earth is
one lakh eighteen thousand yojanas thick. The sixth earth is one lakh sixteen
thousand yojanas thick. The seventh earth is one lakh eight thousand yojanas
thick."  **Discussion:** (From verses 65 to 66) Among the ten types of rebirths
previously discussed, the Acharyas who speak of four types of world-ending
beings, do so by taking the four types of beings: 1) Nairyaik beings of the hell
realm, 2) beings of the animal realm, 3) beings of the human realm, and 4)
beings of the god realm.   When this is said, there is a natural curiosity about
where the Nairyaik and other beings reside, what are the names, gotras, and
extent of their dwelling places, the hell realms? Various information about the
hell realms and the hell beings is given in these sutras and in the following
sutras.   First, a question is asked about the types of hell beings. In
response, it is said that there are seven types of hell beings. Seven types of
hell beings are mentioned in relation to the seven hell realms, such as the
first earth Nairyaik to the seventh earth Nairyaik.   After this, there are
questions and answers about the names and gotras of the hell realms. The
difference between name and gotra is that the name is eternally established and
without meaning, meaning that the name does not necessarily have to have
qualities corresponding to it, while the gotra is primarily based on qualities.
The names and gotras of the seven earths are as follows:

lakh eighty thousand one lakh thirty-two thousand one lakh twenty-eight thousand
one lakh twenty thousand one lakh eighteen thousand one lakh sixteen thousand
one lakh eight thousand.  The prominence of the Gotra is more important than the
name, therefore the question has been asked mentioning the Gotra of Ratnaprabha
etc. and the answer has been given in the same way. The Gotras of the
Narakabhumi are according to their meaning, therefore explaining their meaning,
the ancient teachers have said that where there is an abundance of gems, it is
Ratnaprabha. Here, the meaning of 'Prabha' is abundance. Similarly, one should
understand the same for the rest of the Prithvis. Where there is a predominance
of sugar (gravel), it is Sharkaraprabha. Where there is a predominance of sand,
it is Balukaprabha. Where there is a predominance of mud, it is Pankaprabha.
Where there is a glow like smoke, it is Dhumarprabha. Where there is an
abundance of darkness, it is Tamasprabha and where there is an abundance of very
dense darkness, it is Tamatamprabha. Here, in some copies, two Sangrahani Gatha
are given which tell the names and Gotras of these Prithvis; which are given in
the footnote below.  After this, there are questions and answers regarding the
thickness of each Narakprithvi. The abundance (thickness) of Narakprithvis has
been mentioned in the brackets above. The Sangrahani Gatha regarding this
subject is as follows - Aasiyam Battisam Atthavisaam Tahev Visaam Cha / Attaras
Solagam Achchuttaramev Hitimiya // This Gatha's meaning has been given in the
original meaning. For clarity, we are giving it here again. The thickness of
Ratnaprabhanarakabhumi is 1 lakh 80 thousand yojanas, Sharkaraprabha is 1 lakh
32 thousand, Balukaprabha is 1 lakh 28 thousand, Pankaprabha is 1 lakh 20
thousand, Dhumarprabha is 1 lakh 18 thousand, Tamasprabha is 1 lakh 16 thousand
and Tamatamprabha's thickness is 1 lakh 8 thousand yojanas. Now, in the next
Sutra, there are questions and answers regarding the difference between
Ratnaprabha etc. Narakprithvis. 1. Ratnanaam Prabha Bahulyaam Yatra Sa

##  [198] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra Vivcehan - This sutra asks about the types
(divisions) of the earth Ratnaprabha, etc. The answer states that there are
three types (divisions) of Ratnaprabha earth, namely - Kharakanda,
Pankabahulkaanda and Apbahulkaanda. Kaanda means - specific land / Khar means
hard / The first Kharakanda of Ratnaprabha earth has 16 divisions / The first
division called Ratnakaanda, the second division called Vajrakaanda, the third
division called Vaidaryakaanda, and so on, the sixteenth division called Rishtar
Ratnakaanda. There are sixteen divisions of Kharakanda of Ratnaprabha according
to the names of sixteen gems / Each kaanda is one thousand yojan thick / Thus,
Kharakanda is sixteen thousand yojan thick. From the said Ratnakaanda to
Rishtkaanda, all kaandas are of the same type, i.e. they have no further
divisions. The second kaanda is Pankabahul / It has an abundance of mud and has
no further divisions, so it is of one type. This second kaanda is 84 thousand
yojan thick / The third Apbahulkaanda has an abundance of water and has no
divisions, it is of one type. It is 80 thousand yojan thick / Thus, by combining
the three kaandas of Ratnaprabha, the total thickness of Ratnaprabha becomes
(16+84+80) one lakh eighty thousand. The other Narakaprithvi, from
Sharkaraprabha to Adhasaptamapৃথিবী, have no divisions / They are all of the
same size / The number of Narakavasa is 70.  From this, O Bhavan! How many lakhs
of Narakavasa are there in the Ratnaprabha earth? Gautama! Thirty lakhs of
Narakavasa are mentioned. According to this gatha, the number of Narakavasa in
the seven Narakas should be known / In the first earth, thirty lakhs, in the
second, twenty-five lakhs, in the third, fifteen lakhs, in the fourth, ten
lakhs, in the fifth, three lakhs, in the sixth, five less than one lakh, and in
the seventh earth, there are five Anuttara Mahaan Narakavasa. The five very
large Anuttara Mahaan Narakavasa mentioned in Adhasaptamapৃথিবী are - 1. Kaal,
2. Mahakaal, 3. Rouru, 4. Maharouru and 5. Apratishthan / Vivcehan - This sutra
mentions the number of Narakavasa in each Narakaprithvi /

##  Number of Hells in the Jain Cosmology  **Creation and Types of Hells:**
There are two types of hells in the six earths, starting from the first
Ratnapraba earth and ending with the sixth Tamahpraba earth:
**Pravalikapravisht** and **Prakirnak**.  The hells that are arranged in a row
are **Pravalikapravisht**, and those that are scattered are **Prakirnak**.
**Ratnapraba Earth:**  * Ratnapraba earth has thirteen **Prastara** (layers).
Each **Prastara** is like a house. * The first **Prastara** has 49 hells in each
of the four directions (East, West, North, South) and 48 hells in each of the
four intermediate directions (Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, Southwest). In
the middle is a **Narakendraka** called **Simantaka**. * In the remaining twelve
**Prastara**, the number of hells decreases by eight in each direction and
intermediate direction.  * Therefore, the first **Prastara** has 389 hells, the
second has 381, the third has 373, and so on. * In total, there are 4433
**Pravalikapravisht** hells in the thirteen **Prastara** of Ratnapraba earth. *
The remaining 2,965,567 hells are **Prakirnak**. * In total, there are 3 million
hells in the first Ratnapraba earth.  **Sharkara Praba Earth:**  * Sharkara
Praba earth has eleven **Prastara**. * The first **Prastara** has 36
**Pravalikapravisht** hells in each of the four directions, 35 in each of the
four intermediate directions, and one **Narakendraka** in the middle, totaling
285 hells. * In the remaining ten **Prastara**, the number of hells decreases by
eight in each direction and intermediate direction. * In total, there are 2695
**Pravalikapravisht** hells in the eleven **Prastara** of Sharkara Praba earth.
* The remaining 2,497,305 hells are **Prakirnak**. * In total, there are 2.5
million hells in the second Sharkara Praba earth.  **Balukapraba Earth:**  *
Balukapraba earth has nine **Prastara**. * The first **Prastara** has 25 hells
in each of the four directions, 24 in each of the four intermediate directions,
and one **Narakendraka** in the middle, totaling 197 **Pravalikapravisht**
hells. * In the remaining eight **Prastara**, the number of hells decreases by
eight in each direction and intermediate direction. * In total, there are 1485
**Pravalikapravisht** hells in the nine **Prastara** of Balukapraba earth. * The
remaining 1,498,515 hells are **Prakirnak**. * In total, there are 1.5 million
hells in the third Balukapraba earth.  **Pankapraba Earth:**  * Pankapraba earth
has seven **Prastara**. * The first **Prastara** has 16 **Pravalikapravisht**
hells in each of the four directions, 15 in each of the four intermediate
directions, and one **Narakendraka** in the middle, totaling 125 hells. * In the

## Third Chapter: Inquiry about the Ghonodadhi, etc.  [201 Inquiry about the
Ghonodadhi, etc.] 71. "Venerable Sir! Below this Ratnaprabha earth, is there a
Ghonodadhi, a Ghanavat, a Tanuvat, and pure Akasha?" "Yes, Gautama! There is." /
"Similarly, below all seven earths, there is a Ghonodadhi, a Ghanavat, a
Tanuvat, and pure Akasha." [71]  **Explanation:**  This Sutra explains the
foundation of the Naraka earths. It is natural to question what these seven
Naraka earths are based on. The Sutrakar answers that these earths are situated
on frozen water, which is called Ghonodadhi.   The question arises: what is the
Ghonodadhi based on? The answer is that the Ghonodadhi is situated on Ghanavat,
which is solidified air. Ghanavat is based on Tanuvat (light air), and Tanuvat
is established on Akasha. Akasha is self-established and does not depend on
anything.   Therefore, Akasha supports Tanuvat, Tanuvat supports Ghanavat,
Ghanavat supports Ghonodadhi, and Ghonodadhi supports the Ratnaprabha and other
earths.  One might question how the earth can be supported by air and the ocean
by the earth. This is explained through a worldly example.   Imagine a person
inflating a bladder with air. They then tie the mouth of the bladder tightly
with a ribbon and also tie the middle part of the bladder. This creates two
sections of air within the bladder, making it resemble a drum. Then, the person
opens the mouth of the bladder, removes the air from the upper section, and
fills it with water. They then tie the mouth again and untie the middle section.
The water in the upper section will remain there, above the air in the lower
section, and will not fall down. Just as the water rests on the air below, the
Ghonodadhi can rest on the Ghanavat.  Another example is a person wearing a
container filled with air around their waist and entering deep water. They will
remain on the surface of the water and not sink. They will be supported by the
water. Similarly, the earths can rest on the Ghonodadhi.  These seven Naraka
earths are situated one below the other, but they are not directly touching.
There is a significant distance between them. Within this distance, the
Ghonodadhi, Ghanavat, Tanuvat, and pure Akasha are situated one below the other.
**First:** 1. Ratnasharkara, Valuka, Pank, Dhuma, Tamo, Maha-tamo, Prabha bhumis
are established on Ghonodadhi, Vata, and Akasha. These seven are situated one
below the other. - Tattvarth Sutra A. 3.

[202] The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra states that below the Naraka-bhoomi is the
Ghano-dadhi, below that is the Ghana-vat, below that is the Tanu-vat, and below
that is the Akash. After the Akash is the second Naraka-bhoomi. Between the
second and third Naraka-bhoomi, there is also Ghano-dadhi, Ghana-vat, Tanu-vat,
and Akash in that order. In the same way, below all the bhoomis up to the
seventh Naraka-prithvi, there is Ghano-dadhi etc. in the same order. Now the
Sutrakar describes the thickness (bahalya) of the Ratna-kanda etc. - The
thickness of the Ratna-kanda etc. is 72.    "O Bhagavan! What is the thickness
of the Khar-kanda of this Ratna-prabha-prithvi?"  "Gautama! It is said to be
sixteen thousand yojan thick."   "O Bhagavan! What is the thickness of the
Ratna-kanda of this Ratna-prabha-prithvi?"  "Gautama! It is said to be one
thousand yojan thick."   And so on until the Rishta-kanda.   "O Bhagavan! What
is the thickness of the Pank-bahul-kanda of this Ratna-prabha-prithvi?"
"Gautama! It is said to be eighty-four thousand yojan thick."   "O Bhagavan!
What is the thickness of the Ava-bahul-kanda of this Ratna-prabha-prithvi?"
"Gautama! It is said to be eighty thousand yojan thick."   "O Bhagavan! What is
the thickness of the Ghano-dadhi of this Ratna-prabha-prithvi?"  "Gautama! It is
said to be twenty thousand yojan thick."   "O Bhagavan! What is the thickness of
the Ghana-vat of this Ratna-prabha-prithvi?"  "Gautama! It is said to be
countless yojan thick."   And so on for the Tanu-vat and the Pro-vasantara.   "O
Bhagavan! What is the thickness of the Ghano-dadhi of this Sakkara-prabha-
prithvi?"  "Gautama! It is said to be twenty thousand yojan thick."   "O
Bhagavan! What is the thickness of the Ghana-vat of this Sakkara-prabha-
prithvi?"  "Gautama! It is said to be countless yojan thick."   And so on for
the Tanu-vat and the Pro-vasantara.   Just as in the Sakkara-prabha-prithvi, so
it is for all the bhoomis up to the Ahesattama. [72]

## Third Chapter: The Existence of Substances in the Ratnaprabha Earth
**[203]** **Lord!** How thick is the *apbahulkaanda* of this Ratnaprabha earth?
**Gautama!** It is eighty thousand yojanas thick. **Lord!** How thick is the
*ghanodadhi* of this Ratnaprabha earth? **Gautama!** It is twenty thousand
yojanas thick. **Lord!** How thick is the *ghanavaat* of this Ratnaprabha earth?
**Gautama!** It is countless thousands of yojanas thick. Similarly, the
*tanuvaat* and the *aakash* are also countless thousands of yojanas thick.
**Lord!** How thick is the *ghanodadhi* of the Sharkara-prabha earth?
**Gautama!** It is twenty thousand yojanas thick. **Lord!** How thick is the
*ghanavaat* of the Sharkara-prabha earth? **Gautama!** It is countless thousands
of yojanas thick. Similarly, the *tanuvaat* and the *aakash* are also countless
thousands of yojanas thick. Just as the thickness of the *ghanodadhi*,
*ghanavaat*, *tanuvaat* and *aakash* of the Sharkara-prabha earth has been
stated, so should it be known for all the remaining earths (up to the seventh
earth).  **Discussion:** Earlier, the external dimensions of the hell earths
were stated. In this sutra, the three *kaanda*s of the Ratnaprabha earth and the
external dimensions of the *ghanodadhi*, *ghanavaat*, *tanuvaat* and *aakash*
have been explained. The *kaanda*s are only present in the Ratnaprabha earth.
There are sixteen divisions of the *kharakaanda* and the external dimension of
each division has been stated as one thousand yojanas. The total external
dimension of the sixteen *kaanda*s is sixteen thousand yojanas. The
*pankabahul*, the second *kaanda*, has an external dimension of eighty-four
thousand yojanas and the *apbahul*, the third *kaanda*, has an external
dimension of eighty thousand yojanas. Thus, adding the external dimensions of
all three *kaanda*s of the Ratnaprabha earth, the thickness of the Ratnaprabha
earth is one lakh eighty thousand yojanas. Below each earth, there is
successively the *ghanodadhi*, *ghanavaat*, *tanuvaat* and *aakash*. Therefore,
their external dimensions have also been stated. The external dimension of the
*ghanodadhi* is twenty thousand yojanas. The external dimension of the
*ghanavaat* is countless thousands of yojanas. The external dimension of the
*tanuvaat* and the *aakash* is also countless thousands of yojanas each. The
external dimensions of the *ghanodadhi* etc. of all the earths are the same.
**The Existence of Substances in the Ratnaprabha etc.** **[73]** **Thus, Lord!**
In the Ratnaprabha earth, which is eighty thousand yojanas thick, are there
substances like black, blue, red, yellow, white, fragrant, odorous, foul-
smelling, sweet, bitter, astringent, sour, salty, hard, soft, heavy, light,
cold, hot, dry, wet, round, square, triangular, rectangular, and other shapes,
which are bound together, which are interlocked, which are dense, which are
bound together by mutual attraction, and which are in mutual contact? **Yes,
there are.**

## Third Chapter: The Existence of Substances in Ratnaprabha etc.  [205 Yes,
Gautama! Similarly, in the Apbahul Kand, which is eighty thousand yojanas in
extent, there are also substances with prior specific characteristics. Bhagavan!
Are there substances with prior specific characteristics in the Ghanodadhi of
this Ratnaprabha earth, which is twenty thousand yojanas in extent and divided
by intellect? Yes, Gautama! There are. Similarly, there are substances in the
Ghanavat and Tanuvat, which are countless thousands of yojanas in extent, and in
the Akasha as well. O Bhagavan! Are the substances in the Sharkaraprabha earth,
which is one lakh thirty-two thousand yojanas in extent and divided by intellect
into Prataradi forms, mutually connected with prior specific characteristics?
Yes, Gautama! There are. Similarly, one should understand the same in the
Ghanodadhi, which is twenty thousand yojanas in extent, and in the Ghanavat and
Akasha, which are countless thousands of yojanas in extent. Like Sharkaraprabha,
one should understand the statement in the same order up to the seventh earth.
**Discussion:** In the present sutra, the existence of substances in all seven
Naraka earths, in the three Kands of Ratnaprabha earth, in the Ghanodhadhis,
Ghanavats, Tanuvats, and in the spaces between them has been stated. Everywhere,
the existence of substances transformed into various Paryayas in relation to
color, smell, taste, touch, and form has been described.  **The order of
questions and answers is as follows:**  First, the existence of substances in
Ratnaprabha earth has been stated. Then, in order, from Kharkand, Ratnakanad to
Rishtkand, Punkbahulkand, Apbahulkand, Ghanodadhi, Dhanavat, Tanuvat, and in the
spaces between them, the existence of substances has been stated. After that,
the existence of substances in Sharkaraprabha earth, in its Ghanodadhi-Dhanavat-
Tanuvat and in the spaces between them has been described. Like Sharkaraprabha
earth, the statement of all seven earths has been made.  The meaning of the
words "AnnamAnnabadhai" etc. used in the sutra is as follows:
**AnnamAnnabadhai:** Mutually connected. **AnnamAnnaputai:** Touching each
other. **AnnamAnnaogadhai:** Where one substance exists, there also other
substances exist in the same space or in the whole. **AnnamAnasinehapdibadhai:**
Mutually connected due to the quality of affection, so that when one moves, the
other also moves, and when one is grasped, the other is also grasped.
**AnnamNaghadatae Chitthati:** Mixed together deeply like milk and water, or
united.

## 208] Gautama, the *Jobajovaabhigamsutra* states that there are three types of
*valayas* (rings): *Ghano-udadhi-valaya*, *Dhana-vat-valaya*, and *Tanu-vat-
valaya*.  O Bhagavan, how many types of *charamanta* (extremities) are there in
the southern direction of the *Ratna-prabha* earth? Gautama, there are three
types of *charamanta*, namely *Ghano-udadhi-valaya*, *Dhana-vat-valaya*, and
*Tanu-vat-valaya*.  Similarly, one should describe the *charamanta* of the
northern direction.  Similarly, one should describe the types of *charamanta* in
all directions up to the northern *charamanta* of all the seven earths.
**Discussion:** This *sutra* explains how far the *aloka* (light) is from the
*charamanta* of the hellish earths.  The *aloka* is twelve *yojanas* away from
the *charamanta* of the eastern direction of the *Ratna-prabha* earth.  In other
words, there is a distance of twelve *yojanas* between the *charamanta* of the
eastern direction of the *Ratna-prabha* earth and the *aloka*.  Similarly, the
*aloka* is twelve *yojanas* away from the *charamanta* of the south, west, and
north directions of the *Ratna-prabha* earth.  Here, the direction is a sign,
therefore, the *aloka* is twelve *yojanas* away from the *charamanta* of all
four directions, and there is a distance between them.  The *aloka* is thirteen
*yojanas* minus one-third from the *charamanta* of all directions and sub-
directions of the *Sharkara-prabha* earth.  In other words, there is such a
distance between the *charamanta* and the *aloka*.  The *aloka* is thirteen
*yojanas* (complete thirteen *yojanas*) including the aforementioned one-third
from the *charamanta* of all directions and sub-directions of the *Baluka-
prabha* earth.  There is such a distance between them.  There is a distance of
fourteen *yojanas* between the *Pank-prabha* and the *aloka*.  There is a
distance of fifteen *yojanas* minus one-third between the *Dhuma-prabha* and the
*aloka*.  There is a distance of fifteen *yojanas* including the aforementioned
one-third between the *Tama-prabha* and the *aloka*.  There is a distance of
sixteen *yojanas* between the *charamanta* of the seventh earth from below and
the *aloka*.  After explaining this distance, the question is asked whether
these distances are in the form of space or whether *Ghano-udadhi* etc. are
present in them?  The answer is that these distances are filled with *Ghano-
udadhi*, *Ghanavat*, and *Tanuvat*.  Here, these *Ghano-udadhi* etc. are ring-
shaped, therefore, they are called *Ghano-udadhi-valaya*, *Dhana-vat-valaya*,
and *Tanu-vat-valaya*.  The outer extent of *Ghano-udadhi* etc. mentioned
earlier below all the hellish earths is of their middle part.  After that, due
to the loss of area, they become thinner and thinner, reaching their respective
earths, and remain encircling their respective earths in a ring-shaped manner,
therefore, they are called *valayas*.  The height of these *valayas* is the same
everywhere according to their respective earths.  The horizontal outer extent
will be explained later.  Here, only the division of distances is explained.
The horizontal outer extent of the *Ghano-udadhi-valaya* is 76.  **(1)** O
Bhagavan, what is the outer extent of the *Ghano-udadhi-valaya* of the *Ratna-
prabha* earth? Gautama, it is six *yojanas*.  What is the outer extent of the
*Ghano-udadhi-valaya* of the *Sharkara-prabha* earth?

Venerable Sir, are there substances like black, etc., in the [dense water ring]
of the [earth of the Sugar-Light], which is six yojanas in outer layer and has
divisions like [pratra, etc.], as conceived by the mind, including the three
parts?  **Answer:** Gautama, yes, there are.  And so on, one should say the same
for the [dense water ring] of the seventh [earth], adding the appropriate
adjective for the outer layer.  **Question:** Venerable Sir, are there
substances like black, etc., in the [dense water ring] of the [earth of the
Jewel-Light], which is four and a half yojanas in outer layer and has divisions
like [pratra, etc.], as conceived by the mind?  **Answer:** Gautama, yes, there
are.  And so on, one should say the same for the seventh [earth], adding the
appropriate adjective for the outer layer.  Similarly, one should say the same
for the [thin water ring] of the seventh [earth], adding the appropriate
adjective for the outer layer.  **Question:** Venerable Sir, what is the shape
of the [dense water ring] of the [earth of the Jewel-Light]?  **Answer:**
Gautama, it is said to be round and ring-shaped, because it surrounds the [earth
of the Jewel-Light] on all sides.  Similarly, one should understand the shape of
the [dense water ring] of all seven [earths]. The special feature is that they
all surround their respective [earths].

212]  O Bhagavan! What is the shape of the *Dhanavatavala* of this Ratnapraba
earth? Gautama! It is said to be circular and ring-shaped, because it surrounds
the *Ghanodadhivala* of this Ratnapraba earth on all sides. In the same way, one
should know the shape of the *Dhanavatavala* of all seven earths. O Bhagavan!

Ratnapraba earth, and none are not born. And so it is up to the *Adhesattama*
earth. O Bhagavan! Are all *pudgalas* born in this Ratnapraba earth, or are some

are not born. And so it is up to the *Adhesattama* earth.

## Third Chapter: The Production of All Living Beings and Pudgalas [213 [77]
**O Bhagavan!** Have all living beings in this Ratnapraba earth been produced
from the beginning of time, or have they been produced simultaneously?
**Gautam!** In this Ratnapraba earth, all living beings have been produced from
the beginning of time, but not all living beings have been produced
simultaneously in Ratnapraba. Similarly, the question and answer should be
stated up to the seventh earth.  **O Bhagavan!** Has this Ratnapraba earth been
abandoned by all living beings in the past, or has it been abandoned by all
living beings simultaneously in the past?  **Gautam!** This Ratnapraba earth has
been abandoned by all living beings in the past, but not all living beings have
abandoned it simultaneously in the past. Similarly, the question and answer
should be stated up to the seventh earth.  **O Bhagavan!** Have all Pudgalas
entered this Ratnapraba earth from the beginning of time, or have all Pudgalas
entered it simultaneously in the past?  **Gautam!** In this Ratnapraba earth,
all Pudgalas have entered from the beginning of time, but not all Pudgalas have
entered it simultaneously in the past. Similarly, the question and answer should
be stated up to the seventh earth.  **O Bhagavan!** Has this Ratnapraba earth
been abandoned by all Pudgalas in the past, or have all Pudgalas abandoned it
simultaneously in the past?  **Gautam!** This Ratnapraba earth has been
abandoned by all Pudgalas in the past, but not all Pudgalas have abandoned it
simultaneously in the past. Similarly, the question and answer should be stated
up to the seventh earth.  **Discussion:**  The present Sutra asks whether all
living beings and all Pudgalas in the world have undergone movement and
transformation in Ratnapraba and other earths. The meaning of the question is
whether all living beings have been produced in Ratnapraba and other earths from
the beginning of time, or have all living beings been produced simultaneously?
Similarly, the question should be understood in relation to Pudgalas, regarding
their transformation in Ratnapraba and other earths from the beginning of time
or simultaneously.  **Bhagavan said:** Gautam! In this Ratnapraba earth, all
living beings have been produced from the beginning of time, at different times.
Here, by all living beings, only those living beings with a transactional mass
should be understood, not those without a transactional mass. Since the world is
eternal, all living beings have been produced in Ratnapraba and other earths at
different times. But not all living beings have been produced simultaneously in
Ratnapraba and other earths. If all living beings were to be produced
simultaneously in Ratnapraba and other earths, then there would be a lack of
Devas, Tiryanchas, Manushayas, etc. This never happens. The nature of the world
is such. Due to the nature of the world, the four states of existence are
eternal. Therefore, all living beings cannot be produced simultaneously in
Ratnapraba and other earths.

[214] The first question regarding the Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra is about the
origin. The second question is about the exit, "O Bhagavan! Did all beings leave
the Ratnaprabaha and other earths in the past in a chronological order, or did
all beings leave the Ratnaprabaha and other earths together in the past?"
Bhagavan said, "Gautam! All beings left the Ratnaprabaha and other lands in the
past in a chronological order, at different times, but all beings did not leave
them together. All beings cannot abandon the Ratnaprabaha and other lands
together. Because such a cause does not exist. If it is assumed that all beings
abandoned the Ratnaprabaha and other lands together, then the influence of
Narakas would be in the Ratnaprabaha and other lands. This never happens. After
the questions and answers regarding the Jivas, there are questions related to
Pudgalas. Did all Pudgalas become Ratnaprabaha and other forms in the past in a
chronological order, or did all Pudgalas become Ratnaprabaha and other forms
together? Bhagavan said, "All Pudgalas became Ratnaprabaha and other forms in a
chronological order, at different times, because the world is eternal and such a
transformation can happen. But all Pudgalas cannot become Ratnaprabaha and other
forms together. If all Pudgalas become of that form, then there will be a lack
of Pudgalas everywhere else except the Ratnaprabaha and other lands. This never
happens due to the nature of the world. Similarly, all Pudgalas have abandoned
the transformation of the Ratnaprabaha and other forms in a chronological order.
Because the world is eternal, but all Pudgalas have not abandoned the
transformation of the Ratnaprabaha and other forms together. Because if it is
assumed so, then the influence of the form of the Ratnaprabaha and other lands
will be there. This cannot happen. Because the Ratnaprabaha and other lands are
eternal due to the nature of the world. Eternal or non-eternal 78. "O Bhagavan!
Is this Ratnaprabaha earth eternal or non-eternal?" Gautam! It is eternal in
some ways and non-eternal in some ways. "O Bhagavan! Why is it said that it is
eternal in some ways and non-eternal in some ways?" Gautam! It is eternal in
terms of its substance, but non-eternal in terms of its color, smell, taste, and
touch. Therefore, Gautam! It is said that it is non-eternal in some ways. It is
also non-eternal in terms of its middle state. "O Bhagavan! What is the time
period of this Ratnaprabaha earth?" Gautam! It has never been, it is not now,
and it will never be. It is eternal, permanent, stable, imperishable,
continuous, and infinite. It is also non-eternal in terms of its middle state.

[215 Third Proposition: Eternal and Non-Eternal] Gautama! From the perspective
of Dravyathikana, it is eternal, and from the perspective of Varna-Paryayas,
Gandha-Paryayas, Rasa-Paryayas, and Sparsha-Paryayas, it is non-eternal.
Therefore, Gautama! It is said that this Ratnaprabha-Prithvi is in some ways
eternal and in some ways non-eternal.  /  Similarly, one should say the same for
the seven lower Prithvis.  Bhagavan! For how long will this Ratnaprabha-Prithvi
remain? Gautama! This Ratnaprabha-Prithvi was never 'not', it is never 'not',
and it will never be 'not'. It was in the past, it is in the present, and it
will be in the future. It is Dhruva, Nitya, Shashvat, Akshaya, Avyaya,
Avashtita, and Nitya. Similarly, one should know the same for the seven lower
Prithvis.  In the presented Sutra, Ratnaprabha-Prithvi is called both eternal
and non-eternal. This raises a doubt: how can two contradictory qualities exist
in the same thing if eternality and non-eternality are contradictory? If it is
eternal, it cannot be non-eternal, and if it is non-eternal, it cannot be
eternal.  /  Just as coldness and heat cannot coexist.  /  Monistic philosophies
hold such a belief.  /  Therefore, Nitya-Ekantvadis deny non-eternality, and
Anitya-Ekantvadis deny eternality.  Samkhya and other philosophies support the
concept of eternal monism, while Buddhism and other philosophies support the
concept of momentary-non-eternal monism. Jainism rejects both these monisms and
supports Anekanta. Jain Agamas and Janadarshan view every object from various
perspectives, accepting its diverse and unified nature. Objects have different
forms due to different interpretations and perspectives, and within that
diversity, their unity remains. Monistic philosophies consider only one quality
as the whole object. However, in reality, objects have different forms from
various perspectives.  /  Therefore, monism is incomplete and one-sided. It does
not reveal the complete and true nature of the object. Jainism views the object
holistically and states that every object is both eternal and non-eternal,
general and specific, unified and diverse, different and non-different,
depending on the perspective.  /  By accepting this, the accusation of
contradictory qualities by monistic philosophies is not true. Because the
contradiction arises only when something is called eternal, non-eternal, etc.,
from the same perspective or interpretation.  /  There is no fault or
inconsistency when considering it from different perspectives or
interpretations. For example, the same person is a father, son, maternal uncle,
paternal uncle, etc., depending on the relationship.  /  What is the
contradiction here? This is an experienced and practical fact.  _Jainism proves
its Anekanta perspective based on Nayas. In short, there are two types of Nayas:
1. Dravyathikana and 2. Paryayathikana.  /  Dravyanaya considers the general
nature of the object, and Paryayanaya considers the specific nature of the
object.  /  Every object is Dravya-Paryayatmak. '1. Utpadavyayadhrauvyamuktam

[216] The essence of the *jiva-jiva-abhigamsutra* is neither solely a substance
nor solely a mode. It is both. Modes cannot exist without substance, and
substance cannot exist without modes. Substance is the basis of modes, and modes
are the dependent of substance. Without the dependent, there is no basis, and
without the basis, there is no dependent. Modes cannot exist without substance,
and substance cannot exist without modes. Therefore, it can be said that the
hypothetically conceived solitary substance is false because it is devoid of
modes. That which is devoid of modes is a false substance, like a barren son who
is devoid of the modes of childhood, etc. Similarly, it can be said that the
hypothetically conceived solitary mode is false because it is different from
substance. That which is different from substance is false, like the modes of
childhood, etc., of a barren son. Therefore, it is proven that the essence is
both substance and mode, and it should be considered holistically from both
perspectives. Taking into account this *anekantavadi* and proven perspective,
the sutra states that the *ratnaprabha* earth is eternal in relation to
substance. That is, the form, existence, etc., of the *ratnaprabha* earth has
always been, is, and will always be. Therefore, it is eternal. However, its
modes of color, such as black, etc., its modes of smell, etc., its modes of
taste, its modes of touch, etc., change every moment, therefore it is also non-
eternal. Thus, from the perspective of the *dravya-athikanaya*, the
*ratnaprabha* earth is eternal, and from the perspective of the *paryaya-
athikanaya*, it is non-eternal. Similarly, one should understand the statement
about the seven hellish earths. When the eternality of the *ratnaprabha*, etc.,
is stated in relation to substance, there may be a doubt whether this eternality
is in the form of existence throughout all time or in the form of existence for
a long time, as the other *tirthankaras* say - is this earth eternally existent
for a kalpa? This doubt is resolved by stating that this earth has always been,
is, and will always be from beginningless time. It is beginningless and endless.
Being present in all three times, it is firm, being of a fixed nature, it is
fixed like a *dharma-stikaya*, being fixed, it is eternal, because it does not
perish. Being eternal, it is imperishable, being imperishable, it is immutable,
and being immutable, it is present in its own proof. Therefore, it is eternal
due to its constant existence. Alternatively, the words *dhruva*, etc., can be
understood as synonymous. Various synonymous words have been used to emphasize
eternality. Similarly, one should understand the eternality of the seven earths.
The division of the *pravis* 79. "Thus, *bante*, what is the distance between
the *charimanta* who are above the *ratnaprabha* earth and the *charimanta* who
are below it?" "Go *yama*, they are separated by a distance of one hundred
thousand *yojanas*." "Thus, *bante*, what is the distance between the
*charimanta* who are above the *ratnaprabha* earth and the *charimanta* who are
below the *kharas* *kanda*?" "Go *yama*, they are separated by a distance of
sixteen thousand *yojanas*."   1. *Dravyam paryaya-viyuta, paryaya dravya-vajita

## Third Understanding: Equality etc. in Relation to Thickness [219]  There is a
difference between the upper limit of the Dhanavat and the lower limit of the
Dhanavat. There is also a difference of countless lakhs of yojanas between the
lower limit of the Dhanavat and the upper and lower limits of the Tanuvat and
the Avashaantar. In this way, it should be said up to the seventh earth.   **The
special feature is that the relationship of the Ghanodadhi should be connected
with the intellect in relation to the thickness of the earth.** For example,
there is a difference of one lakh eighty-eight thousand yojanas between the
upper limit of the third earth and the limit of the Ghanodadhi.   There is a
difference of one lakh forty-four thousand yojanas between the upper limit of
the Pankaprabha earth and the limit of its Ghanodadhi. There is a difference of
one lakh thirty-six thousand yojanas between the upper limit of the Ghumpabha
and the limit of its Ghanodadhi. There is a difference of one lakh thirty-six
thousand yojanas in the Tamahprabha and a difference of one lakh twenty-eight
thousand yojanas between the upper limit of the Adhasaptamah earth and the limit
of its Ghanodadhi.   Similarly, in the inquiry of the lower limit of the
Dhanavat, in the inquiry of the upper and lower limits of the Tanuvat and the
Avashaantar, it should be said that there is a difference of countless lakhs of
yojanas.   **Equality etc. in relation to thickness 80.**  "O Bhagavan! Is this
Ratnapraba earth equal, superior, or countable in thickness compared to the
second hell earth? And in terms of expanse, is it equal, inferior, or
uncountable?"  "Gautama! This Ratnapraba earth is not equal, is superior, and is
uncountable in thickness compared to the second hell earth. In terms of expanse,
it is not equal, is inferior, and is not uncountable."  "O Bhagavan! Is the
second hell earth equal in thickness compared to the third hell earth?" And so
on, it should be said in the same way.   Similarly, it should be understood in
the case of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth hell earths.   "O Bhagavan! Is
the sixth hell earth equal, superior, or countable in thickness compared to the
seventh hell earth?" It should be said in the same way.   "So be it, Bhagavan!
So be it, Bhagavan! This is the first Neraiyauddesa." [80]

## 220 [Jivajivaabhigamsutra, O Bhagavan! (As you said) it is so, it is so /
Thus, the first Nairyika Uddeshaka is complete.   **Discussion:** This Sutra
raises questions regarding the relative equality, superiority, or inferiority,
or the numerical superiority or inferiority, in terms of the external size and
extent of the Naraka-Prithvis.   **Doubt:** It may be doubted that since the
external size of the Naraka-Prithvis has been explained in the previous Sutras,
this information is already known, so what is the use of these questions? This
doubt is valid, but the solution is that these questions are asked to dispel the
ignorance of others who are slow-witted, even though the speaker already knows
the answers.   **Types of Questions:** There are two types of questions - one is
a Gya-Prashna (question for knowledge) and the other is an Agnya-Prashna
(question for ignorance). A question asked with the intention of explaining to
others, even though the speaker already knows the answer, is a Gya-Prashna. A
question asked out of one's own curiosity is an Agnya-Prashna.   **The
Question:** The question asked above is a Gya-Prashna, asked for the benefit of
the slow-witted. How can we say it is a Gya-Prashna? Because the question that
follows is for self-realization.   **The Question and Answer:** The Sutra asks
whether the Ratnaprabha-Prithvi is equal in thickness, superior, or numerically
superior to the other Naraka-Prithvis. The answer is that it is not equal, it is
superior, but not numerically superior. This is because the thickness of
Ratnaprabha is one lakh eighty thousand yojanas, and the thickness of the other
Sharkara-Prithvi is one lakh thirty-two thousand yojanas. There is a difference
of forty-eight thousand yojanas between the two.   **Explanation:** Due to this
difference, only superiority occurs, not equality or numerical superiority. We
will list the thickness of all the Prithvis here so that it becomes clear that
the first Prithvi is superior in external size to the second, the second is
superior to the third, the third is superior to the fourth, and so on, until the
sixth Prithvi is superior in thickness to the seventh.   **Thickness of the
Prithvis:** The thickness of the first Prithvi is one lakh eighty thousand
yojanas. The thickness of the second Prithvi is one lakh thirty-two thousand
yojanas. The thickness of the third Prithvi is one lakh twenty-eight thousand
yojanas. The thickness of the fourth Prithvi is one lakh twenty thousand
yojanas. The thickness of the fifth Prithvi is one lakh eighteen thousand
yojanas. The thickness of the sixth Prithvi is one lakh sixteen thousand
yojanas. The thickness of the seventh Prithvi is one lakh eight thousand
yojanas.   **Conclusion:** Therefore, in terms of external size, each preceding
Prithvi is superior to its preceding Prithvi, not equal or numerically superior.
In terms of extent, each preceding Prithvi is inferior to its preceding Prithvi,
not equal or numerically inferior. As the area of the Ratnaprabha increases due
to the growth of the Pradesh, etc., the area of the Sharkaraprabha, etc., also
increases proportionally. Therefore, only inferiority occurs.

The third section of the second chapter of the first chapter provides
information about the names, gotras, external characteristics, and other details
of the hells and earths. Now, in the second chapter, which is in sequential
order, a description is being given about which region of the hells and earths
has how many hell-dwellers and what they are like, etc. Its initial sutra is
this: 81. "O Bhagavan! How many earths have been stated?" "Gautama! Seven earths
have been stated, such as Ratnaprabha up to Adhasaptamapṛthvī." "O Bhagavan! In
this Ratnaprabha earth, which has a circumference of one hundred and eighty
thousand yojanas, how far above and how much below, and in the middle, how many
lakhs of hell-dwellers have been stated?" "Gautama! In this Ratnaprabha earth,
which has a circumference of one hundred and eighty thousand yojanas, leaving
one thousand yojanas above and one thousand yojanas below, in the middle, in a
region of one hundred and seventy-eight thousand yojanas, there are thirty lakhs
of hell-dwellers, it has been said." "These hell-dwellers are round inside and
square outside, up to the point where they have unpleasant sensations in these
hells." "In this way, according to this aspiration, one should speak according
to the place and the path of knowledge, wherever there is a circumference and
wherever there are hell-dwellers, adding them as adjectives, up to the seventh
earth, such as in the middle of the Adhasaptamapṛthvī, how many regions have how
many Anuttar, the greatest of the great Mahānarakas, been stated? One should ask
this question and answer it in the same way."

## Third Chapter: Second Objective [223 Discussion - How many Earths are there?]
This question has been asked before and answered previously, stating that there
are seven Earths - from Ratnaprabha to the seventh Earth downwards. Why is it
being asked again? This doubt is natural.   To resolve this, the ancient
teachers have said, "Whatever is said previously is repeated for a specific
reason. That specific reason could be prohibition or permission, or it could be
to highlight a specific aspect of the previous topic." This repeated question
should be understood as an attempt to provide more and specific information
about the previously mentioned topic.  Here, the specific question is: Where are
the hells located within the hell-earths? What is the nature of these hells? And
what kind of suffering do the hell beings experience there?  In response to
these questions, the Lord has said that within the Ratnaprabha Earth, which is
one lakh eighty thousand yojanas thick, there are thirty lakh hells located in
the middle region, starting one thousand yojanas above the upper part and
leaving one thousand yojanas of the lower part. This statement, as I am making
it, has also been made by the Tirthankaras of the past. There is no
contradiction and uniformity in the words of all Tirthankaras.  These hells are
round in the middle and square on the outside. The round shape is mentioned with
respect to the middle part, which is the back. However, with respect to the
entire back and other parts, the hells that are entered through the entrance are
said to be triangular and square in shape. The Pushpavakirna hells are of many
types. The phrase "Jāv asubhā" in the sutra refers to the text given in the
commentary, which means "Ahekh rappasanthāṇa". These hells are sharp like a
razor from the bottom. This means that the ground of these hells is not smooth
or soft, but is filled with pebbles, which cut and tear the feet of the hell
beings upon contact, causing them pain.  "Picchanshārtamasā" - In these hells,
there is always dense darkness. Except for the births and other events of the
Tirthankaras, there is a complete absence of light. The darkness there is always
dense, like that of a blind person or the darkness of a moonless night, because
there are no suns or other sources of light.  To make this even clearer, the
following specific details are given: "Bavagayagahchandasuranakkhaṭṭajoisapha" -
In these hells, there is no path for the planets, moon, sun, stars, and other
celestial bodies. In other words, these sources of light are not present there.

[224] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra] The ground of the hellish realms is stained with
the mud of fat, grease, pus, blood, and flesh, repeatedly smeared.
[Asuibibbachha] Due to the mud of fat, etc., they are extremely repulsive and
disgusting. [Parmaduhbhigandha] These hellish realms are extremely foul-
smelling. They emit a stench like that of dead animal carcasses.
[Kauvaganivannabha] Just as the flame of fire turns very black when iron is
heated, so are these hellish realms of that color. [Kakhkadfasa] The touch of
these hellish realms is extremely rough. Like the edge of a sword, the touch
there is unbearable. [Durahiasa] These hellish realms are so painful that it is
very difficult to endure their suffering. [Asuabhaveyana] These hellish realms
are very inauspicious! Their inauspiciousness is evident just by looking at
them. The color, smell, taste, touch, and sound there are all inauspicious. And
the suffering that the beings experience there is also extremely unbearable,
hence the epithet "Asuabhaveyana". There are three types of unbearable suffering
in the hellish realms.   The statement made regarding the Ratnapraba earth
applies to the Sharkarapraba earth as well. Only the thickness of the
Sharkarapraba earth and the number of its hellish realms should be added as a
qualifier. For example, the text related to the Sharkarapraba earth would be as
follows: "Sakkarappamae nam bhantae! Pudhaviye battisuttar-
joyanasayasahassabahllaae uri kevaiyam ogaahitta hettha kevaiyam vajjetta majjhe
chev kevaie kevaiya nirayaavassayasahassa pannatta? Goyama! Sakkarappabhaae
battisuttar-joyanasayasahassabahllaae uri ega joyanasahassam ogaahitta heva ega
joyanasahassam vajjetta majjhe tisuttar joyanasayasahasse, ettha nam
sakkarappabhaae pudhavineraiyaanam panavisa narayaavassayasaya sahassa bhavanti
ti makkaay, te nam naraga anto vattha jaav asubhanaraesu veyana /"   Similarly,
the text for Balukapraba, Pankapraba, Dhumapraba, and Tamahpraba, and the
seventh earth below should be stated. The thickness of all the earths and the
number of hellish realms should be known from the following bracket: 1. The
following Sangahani gathas are useful in this regard:   Paasiyam battisam
atthavisaam tahev visaam cha / Attharasa solagam atthattaramaev hitthimaya // 1
//  Atthattaram cha tisam chhanvisaam chev sayasahassam tu / Attharasa solagam

## Third Chapter: Description of the Hells  **227. O Bhagavan! What is the
diameter and circumference of the hells on the seventh hell-earth?**
**Gautama:** The hells on the seventh earth are of two types: (1) those with a
diameter of a thousand yojanas, and (2) those with an immeasurable number of
thousand yojanas. The ones with a diameter of a thousand yojanas have a diameter
of one hundred thousand yojanas, and their circumference is three hundred
sixteen thousand two hundred twenty-seven yojanas, three kosas, one hundred
twenty-eight dhanus, and slightly more than thirteen and a half angulas. The
ones with an immeasurable number of thousand yojanas have a diameter of an
immeasurable number of thousand yojanas, and their circumference is also an
immeasurable number of thousand yojanas.  **Discussion:** This sutra describes
the structure, diameter, and circumference of the hells. There are two types of
hells: **pavalikapravisht** and **avalikabahya**. Those that are arranged in a
series in all eight directions are called **avalikapravisht**. They are of three
types: circular, triangular, and square. Those that are scattered like flowers
are of various types. These various types are described in two collections of
verses.  There are hells shaped like an iron chest, a vessel for cooking dough
to make liquor, a baker's oven, a griddle, a frying pan, a **sthali** (large
pot), a **pitharak** (large vessel), a hermit's ashram, a **murj**, a
**nandīmṛdanga**, a **praling** earthen drum, a **sughosha**, a **daddar** (a
type of musical instrument), a **panav** (a drum made of vessels), a **patha**
(a general drum), a **jhalar**, a **bheri**, a **kustumbak** (a type of musical
instrument), and a **nadi** (a timepiece). The **mṛdanga** is narrow at the top
and wide at the bottom, while the **murj** is even at both the top and bottom.
This description should be understood for the hell-earths from **Ratnaprabha**
to **Tamaprabha**. The hells on the seventh earth are only **avalikapravisht**,
not **pavalikabahya**. These **avalikapravisht** hells are five in number: four
in the four directions and one in the middle. The central hell is round, and the
remaining four are triangular. The **Ratnaprabha** hell has an outer diameter of
three thousand yojanas. The lower part of one thousand yojanas is cubic, the
middle part of one thousand yojanas is **jhushira**, and the upper part of one
thousand yojanas is narrow. Similarly, the outer diameter of the hells on all
seven earths is the same. The diameter and circumference are clear from the
original text.  **83. O Bhagavan! What is the color of the hells on the
**Ratnaprabha** earth?**  **Gautama:** The color of the hells on the
**Ratnaprabha** earth is black, dark, deep, dark brown, fierce, and extremely
dark. This is the same for all the hells up to the seventh.  **1. What are the
shapes of the hells?**  They are shaped like a **pitupayanag** (a type of
vessel), a **kandulohi** (a type of vessel), a **kadah** (a type of vessel), a
**thali** (a type of vessel), a **pihadag** (a type of vessel), a **kinha** (a
type of vessel), a **udae** (a type of vessel), a **mukhe** (a type of vessel),
a **muyange** (a type of vessel), a **nandīmuinge** (a type of vessel), a
**praling** (a type of vessel), a **sughosha** (a type of vessel), a **daddare**
(a type of vessel), a **panave** (a type of vessel), a **padhag** (a type of
vessel), a **jhalari** (a type of vessel), a **bheri** (a type of vessel), a
**kutdhumbag** (a type of vessel), and a **nadi** (a type of vessel).

## Third Question: How large are the hells?  [229]  The touch of a group of
needles, the touch of a prickly vine, the sting of a scorpion, the touch of
embers, flames, the fire of a furnace, a burning coal, a burning piece of wood,
the fire of a red-hot iron ball - is the touch of the hells like any of these?
The Lord said, "No, their touch is even more unpleasant than these." In the same
way, one should understand the touch of the hells up to the seventh earth.  How
large are the hells? 84. "O Venerable One! How large are the hells on the
Ratnapraba earth?" "Gautama! This Jambudvipa, which is the innermost of all the
islands, the smallest of all the island-oceans, is round like a fried cake,
round like a chariot wheel, round like a lotus seed, round like a full moon, and
is one hundred thousand yojanas in length and breadth. Its circumference is
slightly more than three lakh sixteen thousand two hundred twenty-seven yojanas,
three kos, one hundred twenty-eight dhanus, and thirteen and a half angulas. A
god, who is very powerful and has great influence, could traverse this entire
Jambudvipa in three snaps of his fingers, saying 'now, now'. He would travel
with a divine speed, which is excellent, swift, agile, fierce, quick, bold,
powerful, skillful, and divine. Even if he were to travel for one day, two days,
three days, or even for six months at his fastest speed, he would not be able to
cross even one of those hells. O Gautama! This is how large the hells on the
Ratnapraba earth are. Similarly, it should be understood that the hells on the
seventh earth are also very large. In particular, he can cross one of those
hells, but he cannot cross the remaining four."  [84] This sutra explains the
size of the hells through similes. The question about the size of the hells has
already been asked and answered. It was said that some hells are countless
thousands of yojanas in size. The phrase "countless thousands of yojanas"
clearly indicates...

[230] (How can we know the extent of this innumerable number? Therefore, the
Lord has explained it through an analogy. The analogy is as follows: The island
we live on is called Jambudvipa. It is named after the Jambū tree, which is
eight yojanas high and made of jewels. Jambudvipa is the innermost of all
islands and oceans, meaning it is the most fundamental and the smallest among
them. All the subsequent salt oceans and Ghatakikhanda islands are twice the
size of Jambudvipa in terms of their dimensions. Jambudvipa is circular, like a
fried puri. The term "fried" is used because a puri fried in oil is generally
rounder than one fried in ghee. It is round like a chariot wheel, a lotus seed,
and a full moon. Different analogies have been used to explain this to people
from different countries. The diameter of Jambudvipa is one lakh yojanas. Its
circumference is three lakh, sixteen thousand, two hundred and twenty-seven
yojanas, three kosas, one hundred and twenty-eight dhanushas, and slightly more
than thirteen and a half angulas. A god who possesses great wealth, is radiant,
strong, glorious, powerful, happy, and has a vast mind and senses that can
perceive their objects well, and who has unimaginable power to perform specific
actions, can traverse this Jambudvipa twenty-one times in the time it takes to
clap three times, saying "I will cross it, I will cross it." If this god were to
travel continuously for six months, starting from one day, he could cross some
of the Narakas of Ratnaprabha, but not all of them. These Narakas are that vast.
The same can be said for Tamahpraba. There are five Narakas in the seventh
earth. Of these, the middle one, called Apratisthana, is one lakh yojanas in
diameter, and therefore can be crossed. The remaining four Narakas are countless
koti-koti yojanas in size, and therefore cannot be crossed. This is how the
extent of the Narakas has been explained through analogy. The Narakas are made
of... 85. "O Bhagavan! What are the Narakas of Ratnaprabha earth made of?"
"Gautama! They are made entirely of vajra (diamond)." In those Narakas, many
beings and liberated souls fall, wander, suffer, and are tormented. They are
tormented by the heat of the Narakas, by the colors, smells, tastes, and touches
of the Narakas. This continues until the seventh earth. [85]

## Third Rebirth: Uppaata [231 (Kharabadar Prithvikaayik) Jivas and Pudgala
Decay and are Born, Old Ones Exit and New Ones Arrive / From Dravyathikanaya
They are Eternal, But From Varnaparaya, Gandhaparaya, Rasaparaya and
Sparshaparaya They are Non-Eternal / This Should be Said Up to the Seventh Earth
Downwards.   The question in the present Sutra is that what are the
Ratnaprabhaadi Narakas made of? In the answer it is said that they are entirely
Vajramaya, that is, made of Vajra. In them, the Kharabadar Prithvikaayik Jivas
and Pudgala decay and are born / That is, the previous Jivas exit and new Jivas
arrive and are born / Similarly, some Pudgala decay and some new ones arrive and
join / This process of coming and going continues there constantly / Despite
this, the creation of Ratnaprabhaadi Narakas is eternal. Therefore, from the
perspective of Dravyanaya, they are eternal, they were always, they are always
and they will always be / In this way, while being eternal from the perspective
of Dravya, their Varna, Gandha, Rasa and Sparsha keep changing, from this
perspective they are non-eternal. Jain Siddhant believes in the truth from
various perspectives / There is no contradiction in this. There is no
contradiction in considering something eternal and non-eternal from different
perspectives / Syadvad is a completely consistent principle.   Uppaata 86. [1]
"From where, O Bhagavan, do the Nairyaik of Ratnaprabha Prithvi come and are
born? Are they born from Asanjni Jivas, are they born from Sarisrivas, are they
born from Pakshis, are they born from Chaupadas, are they born from Uragas, are
they born from Isthiyas, or are they born from Matsyas and Manusyas?" "Gautama!
They are born from Asanjni Jivas and also from Matsyas and Manusyas." (Here this
gatha is to be followed) _ Asanjni Jivas up to the first Naraka, Sarisrivas up
to the second Naraka, Pakshis up to the third Naraka, Singhas up to the fourth
Naraka. 1. From Sesas, this gatha is to be followed, and with this desire, this
gatha should be chanted.

## Third Pratyapatti: Avagahanavara [233]  O Bhagavan! If the Nairyikas of this
Ratnaprabha earth were to be taken away one by one every moment, in how much
time would this Ratnaprabha earth become empty?  Gautama! The Nairyika beings
are innumerable. Even if one Nairyika were to be taken away every moment, even
after countless Utsarpini and Avasarpini kalpas have passed, this earth would
not become empty. Similarly, this should be said for the seventh earth.  To
explain the number of Naraka beings, it has been established through Asatkल्पना
that if one Naraka were to be taken away every moment, even after countless
Utsarpini and Avasarpini kalpas have passed, their removal would occur. Such a
removal has never happened, does not happen, and will never happen. This is
merely a hypothetical scenario, created to explain the number of Naraka beings.
Avagahanavara 86. [3]  O Bhagavan! What are the two types of body sizes of the
Nairyikas on the Ratnaprabha earth?  Gautama! There are two types of body sizes,
namely: Bhavadharani and Uttarveubviya.  The Bhavadharani is as large as an
angula (finger) multiplied by an uncountable number, and then multiplied by
seven Dhanu (bows) and three Ratnis (jewels).  The Uttarveubviya is as large as
an angula (finger) multiplied by an uncountable number, and then multiplied by
fifteen Dhanu (bows) and eight Ratnis (jewels).  In summary:  * Bhavadharani:
fifteen Dhanu (bows) and eight Ratnis (jewels) multiplied by an uncountable
number of angulas. * Uttarveubviya: thirty-one Dhanu (bows) and one Ratni
(jewel) multiplied by an uncountable number of angulas.  Furthermore:  *
Bhavadharani: one Ratni (jewel) multiplied by thirty-one Dhanu (bows). *
Uttarveubviya: two Ratnis (jewels) multiplied by thirty-one Dhanu (bows).
Additionally:  * Bhavadharani: two Ratnis (jewels) multiplied by sixty-two Dhanu
(bows). * Uttarveubviya: one hundred Ratnis (jewels) multiplied by nineteen
Dhanu (bows).  Finally:  * Bhavadharani: one hundred Ratnis (jewels) multiplied
by nineteen Dhanu (bows). * Uttarveubviya: one hundred Ratnis (jewels)
multiplied by eight Dhanu (bows).  * Bhavadharani: one hundred Ratnis (jewels)
multiplied by eight Dhanu (bows). * Uttarveubviya: one hundred Ratnis (jewels)
multiplied by five Dhanu (bows).

[234] [Jivajovaabhigamsutra Sattamaae Bhavadharanija Pंच Dhanusayaai,
Uttarveubdhie Ghanusahassan. [86] (3) O Bhagavan! How much is the body-immersion
of the Nairyakas of this Ratnapraba earth said to be? Gautama! Two types of
body-immersion are said, namely Bhavadharaniy and Uttarvaikriy / Bhavadharaniy
immersion is from the insignificant to the countless part of an angul and from
the excellent to seven dhanus, three hands and six anguls. Uttarvaikriy
immersion is from the insignificant to the countable part of an angul, from the
excellent to fifteen dhanus, two and a half hands. The second, the body-
immersion of the Nairyakas of Sharkarapraba is from the insignificant to the
countless part of an angul, from the excellent to fifteen dhanus, two and a half
hands. Uttarvaikriy is from the insignificant to the countable part of an angul,
from the excellent to thirty-one dhanus, one hand. In the third hell,
Bhavadharaniy is thirty-one dhanus, one hand and Uttarvaikriy is sixty-two
dhanus, two hands / In the fourth hell, Bhavadharaniy is sixty-two dhanus, two
hands and Uttarvaikriy is one hundred and twenty-five dhanus. In the fifth hell,
Bhavadharaniy is one hundred and twenty-five dhanus and Uttarvaikriy is two
hundred and fifty dhanus. In the sixth hell, Bhavadharaniy is two hundred and
fifty dhanus and Uttarvakriy is five hundred dhanus. "In the seventh hell,
Bhavadharaniy is five hundred dhanus and Uttarvaikriy is one thousand dhanus /
Discussion-In the present sutra, the immersion of the body of the Nairyakas is
stated. There are two types of immersion of their body. One is that which
happens at the time of Bhavadharana and the other is Uttarvaikriy, which is done
by the attainment of Vaikriy. Both types of immersion are of two types,
insignificant and excellent, due to the difference in the effort. In this way,
the form of four types of immersion of each hell's naraka is described / (1) The
Bhavadharaniy immersion of the Nairyakas of Ratnapraba is from the insignificant
to the countless part of an angul and from the excellent to seven dhanus, three
hands and six anguls / Uttarvaikriy is from the insignificant to the countable
part of an angul and from the excellent to fifteen dhanus, two hands and one
vent (two vents make one hand) hence in the original it is said two and a half
hands / (2) In Sharkarapraba, Bhavadharaniy is from the insignificant to the
countless part of an angul and from the excellent to 15 dhanus, 2 // hands /
Uttarvaikriy is from the insignificant to the countable part of an angul and
from the excellent to 31 dhanus, 1 hand. Similarly, in the further earths also,
Bhavadharaniy should be said from the insignificant to the countless part of an
angul and Uttarvaikriy from the insignificant to the countable part of an angul
/ Because due to the lack of such effort

## Third Rebirth: The Gate of Descent [235]  The initial response in the first
time is only as much as the numerical part of an angula. This is how one should
understand the exaggeration. Therefore, the statement of the excellent
*bhavadharani* and excellent *uttarakriya* descent in the subsequent earths is
made in the original text.  (3) In the third *balukaprabha*, the excellent
*bhavadharani* is 31 *dhanus* and 1 *hasta*, and the *uttarakriya* is 62
*dhanus*.  (4) In the fourth *pankaprabha*, the excellent *bhavadharani* is 62
*dhanus*, and the *uttarakriya* is 125 *dhanus*.  (5) In the fifth
*dhumaprabha*, the excellent *bhavadharani* is 125 *dhanus*, and the
*uttarakriya* is 250 *dhanus*.  (6) In the sixth *tamasprabha*, the excellent
*bhavadharani* is 250 *dhanus*, and the *uttarakriya* is 500 *dhanus*.  (7) In
the seventh *tamas-tamasprabha*, the excellent *bhavadharani* is 500 *dhanus*,
and the *uttarakriya* is 1000 *dhanus*.  The excellent *bhavadharani* descent of
each hellish earth is double that of the previous earth, and the *uttarakriya*
descent of the *nairyikas* of each earth is double their *bhavadharani* descent.
The following table will help in understanding the descent:  | Earth Name |
*Bhavadharani* | *Uttarakriya* | |---|---|---| | *Ratnapraba* |  *Asankhyatava*
of an angula | 7 *dhanus* 3 *hasta* 6 angula | *Asankhyatava* of an angula | |
*Sharkaraprabha* | 15 *dhanus* 2 *hasta* | 31 *dhanus* 1 *hasta* | 15 *dhanus* 2
*hasta* | | *Balukaprabha* | 31 *dhanus* 1 *hasta* | 62 *dhanus* 2 *hasta* | 31
*dhanus* 1 *hasta* | | *Pankaprabha* | 62 *dhanus* 2 *hasta* | 125 *dhanus* | 62
*dhanus* 2 *hasta* | | *Dhumaprabha* | 125 *dhanus* | 250 *dhanus* | 125
*dhanus* | | *Tamasprabha* | 250 *dhanus* | 500 *dhanus* | 250 *dhanus* | |
*Tamas-tamasprabha* | 500 *dhanus* | 1000 *dhanus* | 500 *dhanus* |  The measure
of descent in the *prastutas* of *ratnapraba* etc. is as follows: *Ratnapraba*
has 13 *prastutas*. In the first *prastuta*, the excellent descent is 3 *hasta*.
After that, in each *prastuta*, there is an increase of 56 angulas. One should
say this. With this measure, the descent of 13 *prastutas* is as follows:

## Third Chapter: Lesya and Other Doors [239]  **Bhagavan! What is the smell of
the bodies of the Nairyikas on this Ratnaprabha earth?**  **Gautama!** It should
be said as before, like a dead snake, etc. The smell of the Narakas up to the
seventh earth should be known in the same way.  **Bhagavan!** What is the touch
of the bodies of the Nairyikas on this Ratnaprabha earth?  **Gautama!** Their
bodies are devoid of luster, rough, hard, perforated, and rough like a burnt
object due to their skin being torn and wrinkled. (Their bodies are rough like
baked bricks). The same should be said up to the seventh earth.  **Discussion:**
This has been discussed before.  **58. [1] Bhagavan!** How do the Pudgalas
transform into the breath of the Nairyikas on this Ratnaprabha earth?
**Gautama!** The Pudgalas that are Aniṣṭa (unfavorable) up to Amaṇama
(unpleasant) transform into the breath of the Nairyikas. The same should be said
for the Narayikas up to the seventh earth. Similarly, the Pudgalas that are
Aniṣṭa and Amaṇama transform into the food of the Nairyikas. The same should be
known about the Narakas of the seven Naraka earths, Ratnaprabha, etc.  **Lesya
and Other Doors 88. [2] Bhagavan!** How many Lesyas are present in the Nairyikas
on this Ratnaprabha earth?  **Gautama!** One, Kaula Lesya. The same for
Sakkaraprabha.  **On Valayaprabha, two Lesyas are present, namely:** Neelalesya
and Kapotelesya. Of these, Kaula Lesya is more numerous, and Neelalesya is less
numerous.  **On Pankaprabha, one Neelalesya is present.**  **On Dhumaprabha, two
Lesyas are present, namely:** Kinhlalesya and Neelalesya. Of these, Neelalesya
is more numerous, and Kinhlalesya is less numerous.  **On Tama, one Kinhlalesya
is present.**  **On Adhesattama, one Paramkinhlalesya is present.**

## Third Rebirth: Leshyadwar  **[241]** **O Bhagavan!** Are the Naryikas of this
Ratnapraba earth knowledgeable or ignorant? **Gautama:** They are both
knowledgeable and ignorant. Those who are knowledgeable are definitely those
with three types of knowledge: **Bhinibodhikgyani**, **Shrutagnyani**, and
**Avadhigyani**. Those who are ignorant are either those with two types of
ignorance or those with three types of ignorance. Those with two types of
ignorance are, by rule, **Mati-agnyani** and **Shruta-agnyani**, and those with
three types of ignorance are, by rule, **Mati-agnyani**, **Shruta-agnyani**, and
**Vibhanggyani**. The Naryikas of the remaining earth, like Sharkarapraba, are
also both knowledgeable and ignorant. Those who are knowledgeable have all three
types of knowledge, and those who are ignorant have all three types of
ignorance. The same should be said for the Naryikas of the seventh earth.  **O
Bhagavan!** Are the Naryikas of this Ratnapraba earth **Manayoga**,
**Vachanayoga**, or **Kayayoga**? **Gautama:** They are all three. The same
should be said for the seventh earth.  **O Bhagavan!** Are the Naryikas of this
Ratnapraba earth **Sakar Upayoga** or **Anakar Upayoga**? **Gautama:** They are
both **Sakar Upayoga** and **Anakar Upayoga**. The same should be said for the
seventh earth.  **[O Bhagavan!** How much area do the Naryikas of this
Ratnapraba earth know and see through **Avadhi**? **Gautama:** They know and see
an area of three and a half Kos from the lowest point and four Kos from the
highest point. The Naryikas of Sharkarapraba know and see three Kos from the
lowest point and three and a half Kos from the highest point. In this way, you
should say, decreasing by half a Kos, that the Naryikas of the seventh earth
know and see an area of half a Kos from the lowest point and one Kos from the
highest point.]  **O Bhagavan!** How many **Samudghatas** are mentioned for the
Naryikas of this Ratnapraba earth? **Gautama:** Four **Samudghatas** are
mentioned: **Vedanasamudghata**, **Kshayasamudghata**,
**Maranantikasamudghata**, and **Vaikriyasamudghata**. The same should be said
for the Naryikas of the seventh earth.  The commentator has mentioned that there
are many different readings in many manuscripts. It is not possible to explain
all the variations in readings. Only the reading that is found in many
manuscripts and is not contradictory has been taken. Even with variations in
readings, there is no difference in meaning. The text within the brackets in the
original text is not found in the commentary. The subject matter of this sutra
has been explained earlier. In **Leshyadwar**, there is a collection of verses
from the **Shri Bhagavati Sutra** as follows:  "**Kaau dosu taiyaae miisiaa
niiliyaa chauththiieae / Panchhamiyaaeae miisaa kanhaa tatto parmakanhaa //**"

[Jīvājīvābhigamasūtra] In the chapter on Ajñāna, it is said that there are two
types of Ajñāna in some cases and three types in others. The meaning of this is
that the non-sentient Pañcendriya beings, in their imperfect state, do not have
Vibhaṅgajñāna, and hence only two types of Ajñāna are possible. However, in the
remaining time, all three types of Ajñāna are present. The sentient Pañcendriya
beings, even in their imperfect state, have Vibhaṅga, and hence all three types
of Ajñāna are always possible. In the subsequent Narakpaddhatis like
Śarkarāprabhā, only the sentient Pañcendriya beings are born. Therefore, except
for the first Ratnprabhā earth, all the other earths have the three types of
Ajñāna.  [Nārakīs' Hunger and Thirst] (88) Gautama! How do the Nārakīs of the
Ratnprabhā earth experience hunger and thirst? Gautama! Even if all the oceans'
water and all the edible substances are put into the mouth of a Nāraki of the
Ratnprabhā earth, his hunger cannot be satiated, nor can his thirst be quenched.
Gautama! Such intense experience of hunger and thirst is faced by those Nārakīs
of the Ratnprabhā earth. The same should be understood for the Nārakīs up to the
seventh earth.  [One-Many Transformations] (89) Gautama! Can the Nārakīs of the
Ratnprabhā earth transform into one form or into many forms? Gautama! They can
transform into one form as well as into many forms. When transforming into one
form, they can become a single huge mace. And when transforming into many forms,
they can become numerous forms like hammers, axes, swords, spears, lances,
javelins, and even forms resembling a battle array. These transformations can be
countless, connected or unconnected, similar or dissimilar. While transforming,
they strike each other's bodies, experiencing intense, extensive, deep, harsh,
bitter, painful, unbearable, excruciating pain - up to the Dhūmapprabhā earth.

## Third Rebirth: One-Many-Transformation  [243] The Mahantas of the Lohiya-
Kunkhuru-Vai, Dharam-May-Tund-Vai, and Gom-May-Kod-Samana-Vai, are scattered
about. They are scattered, and while eating, they eat, and while moving, they
move, and while entering, they enter, and they experience pain. The pain is
bright, burning, vast, deep, harsh, bitter, rough, cruel, fierce, intense,
painful, unbearable, and difficult to endure. [9] (2) O Bhagavan! Are the
Nairyikas of the Ratna-Prabha-Prithvi capable of creating one form or many
forms? Gautama! They can create one form and many forms. While creating one
form, they are capable of creating a mudgar form, similarly a musandi (a special
weapon), karvat, sword, shakti, plow, gada, musal, chakra, arrow, spear, tomar,
shul, lakut (stick), and bindamal (a special weapon). While creating many forms,
they create many mudgar, bhushandi, and bindamal. While transforming these many
weapon forms, they can only transform the number of weapons, not countless. They
can transform those connected to their body, not those unconnected. They can
create similar forms, not dissimilar. By creating these various weapons, they
strike each other Nairyikas and produce pain. That pain is bright, meaning it
does not have even a little bit of happiness, it burns. It is vast, because it
is spread throughout the entire body. It is deep, because it is spread
throughout the vital points. It is harsh, like the clash of stone blocks breaks
the limbs of the body, similarly that pain breaks the inner parts of the soul.
It is bitter, like a bitter medicine. It is rough, because it creates roughness
in the mind. It is cruel, because it is impossible to retaliate, making it
impenetrable. It is fierce, because it causes anger and determination. It is
intense, because it is excessive. It is painful, unbearable, and difficult to
endure. This should be said up to the Dhum-Prabha-Prithvi (fifth hell). The
Nairyikas of the sixth and seventh Prithvi create many and large (like dung
beetles) red kunthus, whose mouths are like a vajra and who are like dung
beetles. By transforming into such a kunthu form, they climb onto each other's
bodies, repeatedly cut their bodies, and like the insects of the sugarcane
stalk, they enter inside and produce bright, unbearable pain. 89. [3] O
Bhagavan! Do the Nairyikas of the Rayan-Prabha-Prithvi experience cold pain, hot
pain, or both? Gautama! They do not experience cold pain, they experience hot
pain, not both, and so on up to the Balay-Prabha. In the Pank-Prabha, Gautama!
They experience both cold and hot pain, but they do not experience both cold and
hot pain. Those who experience hot pain are more numerous, and those who
experience cold pain are fewer. 1, Here in the manuscripts, the reading ('te
appyara upahajonia vedeti') is excessive and does not make sense. It seems to be
a mistake. Editor.

## Third Pratipati: Eka-Aneka-Vikurvaga  **[245 Gautam!** They are constantly
afraid, constantly terrified, constantly hungry, constantly anxious, constantly
harassed, constantly experiencing the consequences of karma like a killer,
constantly experiencing the ultimate evil, the unparalleled evil, and the
continuous evil of hell.    **Similarly, it should be said up to the seventh
earth.** In the seventh earth, five great hells, the greatest of the great, have
been mentioned, namely: Kal, Mahakal, Rorav, Maharorav, and Apratisthan.
**There, these five great men, having accumulated the most excellent sins of
violence, etc., at the time of death, died and were born in the Apratisthan hell
as Nairyikas:** 1. Parashuram, the son of Jamadagni, 2. Dridhayau, the son of
Lachchati, 3. Uparichar Vasuraj, 4. Subhum, the Kaurava, and 5. Brahmadatt, the
son of Chulan.   **They were born there as Nairyikas, who are black in color,
with a black image, and extremely black, etc.** This description should be given
until they experience the extremely blazing, vast, and unbearable pain there.
**Discussion:** This sutra describes the pain of hell beings related to hunger
and thirst, the pain inflicted on each other by the use of various weapons, the
pain of cold, the pain of heat, and the pain caused by hell.  **Mouth Pain:**
Describing the hunger and thirst of hell beings through false imagination, it is
said that if all edible substances were put into the mouth of one hell being and
all the water of the oceans was given to him, even then his hunger would not be
satisfied, nor would his thirst be quenched.   **A little imagination of this
can be obtained from the condition of a man suffering from the most severe
burning disease in this human world.** Such hell beings are forced to endure
such intense hunger and thirst.  **Weapon Vikurvana Pain:** These hell beings
inflict intense blows on each other using various weapons, both single and
multiple. They inflict intense pain on each other, therefore they are those who
inflict pain on each other. The word "puhuttam" used in the text indicates
multiplicity. Through this action, they inflict brilliant, vast, deep, harsh,
bitter, rough, cruel, fierce, intense, painful, difficult to obtain, and
unbearable pain on others.   **This Vikurvana form of pain should be understood
up to the fifth hell.** In the sixth and seventh hells, the hell beings, with
vajra-like mouths, become like red and dung beetles, taking the form of large
Kunthutras, climb on each other's bodies, and bite and cut, entering deep into
the other hell being's body, like the sugarcane worm that eats the sugarcane and
sieves it, they sieve the hell being's body and inflict pain.  **Cold, etc.,
Pain:** The hell beings of Ratnaprabha earth do not experience cold pain, they
experience heat pain, they do not experience cold and heat pain. These hell
beings are of cold origin. Except for the place of origin, the entire land is
hotter than charcoal, therefore these hell beings experience heat pain, not cold
pain. The combined pain of cold and heat is absent in hell from the very
beginning. In Sharkaraprabha and Balukaprabha, there is also only heat pain. In
Pankaprabha, there is also cold pain, and...

## 246] [Jivajivamigamasutra] There is also the sensation of heat. Some hell
beings experience cold sensations, while others experience hot sensations due to
the different types of hell. There are more hell beings who experience hot
sensations than those who experience cold sensations. In Dhumra-prabha, both
types of sensations exist, but there are more who experience cold sensations and
fewer who experience hot sensations. The sixth hell has cold sensations because
the hell beings there are born with hot yonis (genitals). Except for the yoni-
sthanas (genital areas), the entire region is extremely cold like ice, therefore
they have to experience cold sensations. In the seventh earth, there is
extremely intense cold sensation. The hell beings in the Naraka-bhumis like
Bhavanubhava-vedana, Ratna-prabha, etc., are constantly afraid and apprehensive
due to the extremely dense darkness that pervades the region. They are
constantly tormented by the suffering caused by the Parmadhamika Devas and the
mutual suffering of the hell beings. They are constantly anxious due to the
experience of suffering, they do not get even a moment of peace due to constant
harassment, they constantly experience the inauspicious, inauspicious form, and
the inauspicious form of the accumulated hell-existence. This statement is true
for all hells, only those beings who perform extremely cruel karmas are born in
the seventh earth, the A-pratiṣṭhāna Narakavāsa, not others. As an example, here
are mentioned five great men who were born in the seventh earth, the Pratiṣṭhāna
Narakavāsa, by binding cruel karmas that bind them to a very excellent state and
a very excellent section. They are: 1. Parashurama, the son of Jamadagni, 2.
Dridhayau, the son of Lachchati (according to the commentator, Chatisuta
Dahadal), 3. Uparichar Vasuraja, 4. Subhum, the eighth Chakravarti of the
Koravya gotra, and 5. Brahmadatta Chakravarti, the son of Chulani. It is said
that Parashurama destroyed the Kshatriyas 21 times, making the earth Kshatriya-
less. Subhum was the 14th Chakravarti. He made the earth Brahmin-less seven
times. Such is the legend. This can only happen through intense, cruel
determination. Brahmadatta Chakravarti was extremely attached to enjoyment and
his determination was extremely cruel. Vasuraja, the Uparichar, is famous for
being very truthful, and for this reason, even though he was seated on a crystal
throne, the crystal throne was not visible to the people, so it was spread that
the king would not speak untruth even at the cost of his life. Due to his power,
he was situated above the earth, in the sky. Once, there was a dispute between
the mountain and Narada about the word 'Aj' in the Vedas. The mountain
interpreted 'Aj' as a goat and advocated for a violent sacrifice. While Narada,
with right vision, interpreted 'Aj' as 'not born'. Both came to Vasuraja for
justice. For some reason, Vasuraja sided with the mountain and encouraged the
violent sacrifice. Due to this lie, the Devas were angered and they slapped him
and threw him off the throne. He died due to anger and cruel consequences and
was born in the seventh earth, the A-pratiṣṭhāna Narakavāsa. The aforementioned
five great men and other such extremely cruel beings, having earned the most
excellent sinful karma, were born there and are experiencing the brilliant,
abundant, and unbearable pain of inauspicious color, smell, touch, etc.

[The nature of Ushnavedhana (Burning Sensation)]  [247] The nature of
Ushnavedhana (Burning Sensation)  89. [5] Bhante! In the Naraka (Hells), how do
the Narakis (Denizens of Hell) experience Ushnavedhana (Burning Sensation)?
Gautama! It is as follows: Just as a skilled blacksmith, who is young, strong,
and has a firm grip, with his hands and feet firmly placed, and with the ability
to strike, push, move, shake, and crush, having well-developed arms with thick,
round, and muscular shoulders, and a body covered with thick skin, with a
powerful chest, and skilled, dexterous, and intelligent, takes a large, red-hot
iron ball, heats it repeatedly, hammers it repeatedly, splits it repeatedly,
crushes it repeatedly, until it becomes extremely hot, glowing, and molten, and
then throws it into the Asambhavapratishthapana (Naraka where the Ushnavedhana
is experienced), he sees it sinking, disappearing, and being submerged, and does
not see it emerging, not coming out, or not being submerged again. Just as a
mad, intoxicated elephant in the first part of the rainy season or the last part
of the summer, being tormented by heat, thirst, and the flames of forest fire,
sees a large, four-cornered, deep, cool, and clear pond, with lotus flowers,
water lilies, and other fragrant flowers, and filled with clean water, and
inhabited by various aquatic creatures, and enters it, immerses in it, and
experiences the coolness, the heat, the thirst, the hunger, and the fatigue, and
rests or sleeps or plays or enjoys, in the same way, Gautama! The Narakis, being
in the Asambhavapratishthapana (Naraka where the Ushnavedhana is experienced),
see thousands of such burning, glowing, molten, and emerging and submerging iron
balls, and enter them, experience the heat, the thirst, the hunger, and the
fatigue, and rest or sleep or play or enjoy.

Third Pratipatti: The Nature of Sheetavana  The Nāraka (hellish) being, after
emerging from the Ushṇavednīya (hot) Naraka, sees in this human world various
types of furnaces such as those for boiling jaggery, distilling alcohol, baking
pottery, smelting iron, copper, lead, silver, and gold. These furnaces are
extremely hot, glowing red like blooming Palāśa flowers, emitting thousands of
sparks, flames, and embers, and burning intensely from within. When the Nāraka
being sees these fiery places and enters them, he is able to pacify his own heat
(Ushṇatā) by the heat of the Naraka, quenching his thirst, hunger, and burning
sensation. As a result, he is able to sleep, close his eyes, and regain his
memory, pleasure, fortitude, and equanimity. Gradually, he emerges from there,
experiencing extreme comfort and happiness.  When Gautama asked whether Nārakas
indeed experience such Ushṇavednā (heat sensation), the Bhagavān replied that
the Nārakas experience an even more undesirable form of Ushṇavednā.  The Nature
of Sheetavednā: Gautama asked, "O Bhante! How do the Nāraka beings dwell,
experiencing the Sheetavednā (cold sensation) in the Sheetavednīya Narakas?" The
Bhagavān replied, "Gautama, it would be as if a strong, young blacksmith were to
hold a large, red-hot iron mass with tongs and immerse it for one, two, or three
months at most in the extremely cold Sheetavednīya Narakas. Even then, the
Nāraka being would repeatedly be taken out and thrust back into the extreme
cold, without being allowed to die. In the same way, the Nāraka being, emerging
from the unbearable cold of the Sheetavednīya Narakas, sees in this human world
things like snow, snow mounds, snow flakes, snow piles, frost, frost mounds, ice
ponds, and ice caves, and enters into them. There, he experiences the cold,
thirst, hunger, and burning sensation.

[210] [The first sutra of the Jiva-Jiva-Abhigma Sutra, or the Sutra of the
Approach of Souls, is as follows: Just as a blacksmith's son, who is young,
strong, and skilled, takes a large piece of iron, the size of a small water pot,
and heats it, beats it, and forges it for a day, two days, three days, or even a
month, and then, with a pair of tongs, grasps the hot and fully heated ball of
iron, and with a false notion, throws it into the cold hell (thinking, "I will
take it out in the blink of an eye," but sees it melting, dissolving, and
perishing, and is unable to take it out in its unmelted form), so should one
describe the situation of the Niryayika in the cold hell. And one should also
describe the example of the elephant in the same way, as it emerges from the
lake and roams about in peace and comfort.] In the same way, O Gautama, the
Niryayika, who has emerged from the cold hell with a false notion, sees the cold
places in this human world, such as snow, snowdrifts, snowfields, snowfield
clusters, frost, frost clusters, snow ponds, snow pond clusters, ice, and cold
clusters, and enters them. There, he quenches his hellish cold, thirst, hunger,
fever, and burning, and experiences peace and sleeps, closing his eyes, until he
warms up, becomes very warm, and slowly emerges from there, experiencing
happiness and comfort. O Gautama, the Niryayika in the cold hell experiences
even worse cold than this. [90] O Venerable One, how long is the state of the
Niryayika in the Ratna-Prabha-Pruthvi (Earth of Radiant Jewels) described?
Gautama, it should be described according to the position of the Pannvana, from
the lowest to the highest, up to the seventh earth below. [91] O Venerable One,
where do the Niryayika of the Ratna-Prabha-Pruthvi go after they emerge from
there? Where do they go? Do they go to the Niryayika, or do they go to the
Tiryak-Joni (animal realms)? The description of their emergence should be given
in the same way as it is described in the scriptures, up to the highest.

of Prajnapanasutra, here also it should be said up to the seventh earth below.
**Discussion:** In this Sutra, it is said that the state of Nairyikas and the
subject of Udvartana should be known according to the Prajnapanasutra. What is
said in the Prajnapanasutra needs to be mentioned here. That statement is as
follows:  The name of the earth, the lowest state, the highest state,
Ratnaprabha, Sharkaraprabha, Balakaprabha, Pankaprabha, Dhumaprabha,
Tamasprabha, Tamas-tamas-prabha, ten thousand years, one Sagaropama, three
Sagaropama, seven Sagaropama, ten Sagaropama, seventeen Sagaropama, twenty-two
Sagaropama, one Sagaropama, three Sagaropama, seven Sagaropama, ten Sagaropama,
seventeen Sagaropama, thirty-three Sagaropama.  According to the Prastata, there
are 13 Prastatas of Ratnaprabha, their state is as follows:  **Prastata** |
**Lowest State** | **Highest State** ------- | -------- | -------- First
Prastata | Ten thousand years | Ninety thousand years Second Prastata | Ten lakh
years | Ninety lakh years Third Prastata | Ninety lakh years | Purva-koti
Sagaropama's tenth part Fourth Prastata | Purva-koti Sagaropama's tenth part |

254 [Jivajiva Mimmasutra]  "Bhagavan, how do the Niryayikas of
Ratnaprabhaprithvi experience the touch of the earth?"  "Gautama, they
experience the touch of the earth as unpleasant, painful, and unbearable."
"Similarly, this should be said for the seventh earth."  "Bhagavan, how do the
Niryayikas of Ratnaprabhaprithvi experience the touch of water?"  "Gautama, they
experience the touch of water as unpleasant, painful, and unbearable."
"Similarly, this should be said for the seventh earth."  "Similarly, one should
know about the touch of light, air, and plants for the Niryayikas from
Ratnaprabhaprithvi to the seventh earth."  "Bhagavan, is this Ratnaprabhaprithvi
larger in thickness than the other earths and smaller in length and breadth?"
"Yes, Gautama, this Ratnaprabhaprithvi is larger in thickness than the other
earths and smaller in length and breadth."  "Bhagavan, is the second earth,
called Sharkaraprabha, larger in thickness than the third earth and smaller in
length and breadth?"  "Yes, Gautama, the second earth is larger in thickness
than the third earth and smaller in length and breadth."  "Similarly, this
should be said until the sixth earth is larger in thickness than the seventh
earth and smaller in length and breadth."  [92]  **Discussion:** This sutra
discusses the experiences of the Niryayikas regarding the touch of the earth,
water, light, air, and plants in the hellish earths. The Niryayika beings are
not at all for happiness, therefore they find the touch of the earth, etc. there
to be unpleasant, painful, unpleasant, unbearable, and unbearable.  Although
there is no direct fire in the hellish earths, the touch of the hellish walls
transformed into heat and the indirect heat of the scorching sun should be
understood there.

## Sutīya Pratipatti: The Touch-Based Representation of Earths in Hells [255]
**Along with this sūtra, it is also explained that this Ratnaprabhā earth is the
largest in terms of thickness, as its thickness is 180,000 yojanas, and the
thickness of the subsequent earths is less. The second earth is 132,000 yojanas
thick, the third is 128,000 yojanas thick, the fourth is 120,000 yojanas thick,
the fifth is 118,000 yojanas thick, the sixth is 116,000 yojanas thick, and the
seventh is 108,000 yojanas thick. In terms of length and breadth, Ratnaprabhā
earth is the smallest. Its length and breadth are one rāju. The second earth has
a length and breadth of two rājus. The third has three rājus, the fourth has
four rājus, the fifth has five rājus, the sixth has six rājus, and the seventh
has a length and breadth of seven rājus. In terms of thickness, the subsequent
earths are smaller, and in terms of length and breadth, the subsequent earths
are larger. [93]**  **"O Bhagavan! In each of the thirty lakh narakavāsas of
this Ratnaprabhā earth, have all beings, all bhūtas, all jīvas, and all sattvas
been born in the past as earth-bodied, non-bodied, air-bodied, plant-bodied, and
hell-bodied?" "Yes, Gautama! They have been born many times or an infinite
number of times. This should be said up to the seventh earth. The special
feature is that the number of narakavāsas in each earth should be mentioned
there."**  **"O Bhagavan! In the regions bordering the narakavāsas of this
Ratnaprabhā earth, are the earth-bodied, up to plant-bodied, jīvas, great in
karma, great in action, great in outflow, and great in suffering?" "Yes,
Gautama! The earth-bodied, up to plant-bodied, jīvas in the regions bordering
the narakavāsas of this Ratnaprabhā earth are great in karma, great in action,
great in outflow, and great in suffering."**  **"Similarly, this should be said
up to the seventh earth."**

## Translation:  **[256] The *Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra* Commentary**  This sutra
presents two important questions and their answers. The first question is: "O
Bhagavan! Have all beings, all *bhutas*, all *jivas*, and all *sattvas* been
born in these types of hells before?" Bhagavan said, "Yes, Gautama! All worldly
*jivas* have been born in each of these hells many times or even an infinite
number of times in the past. The world is eternal, and from time immemorial, all
worldly *jivas* have been undergoing birth and death. Therefore, they have been
born in these hells many times or an infinite number of times. It is said,
'There is no such caste and no such womb where this *jiva* has not been born and
died an infinite number of times.'  The words *pran*, *bhut*, *jiva*, and
*sattva* appear in the original text. The *acharyas* have explained them as
follows: 'The term *pran* refers to the two-sensed, three-sensed, and four-
sensed *jivas*. The term *bhut* refers to plants. The term *jiva* refers to the
five-sensed *jivas*. The remaining *jivas* of the earth body, water body, fire
body, and air body are encompassed by the term *sattva*.  The present sutra has
the reading 'पुढवीकाइयात्ताए जाव वणस्सइकाइयत्ताए'. This generally encompasses
the earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied, air-bodied, and plant-bodied
*jivas*. Here, in the *Ratna Prabha* etc., there is an inquiry about the *jivas*
born in those respective forms. Since fire-bodied *jivas* are not born in these
hellish earths, they should be excluded, and the rest should be understood. The
*vrittikara* has also mentioned the same. Therefore, the original meaning is
understood in this way.  The second question is: "Are the earth-bodied, water-
bodied, fire-bodied, air-bodied, and plant-bodied *jivas* who are born up to the
*Ratna Prabha* etc., those who have *maha-karma*, *maha-kriya*, *maha-pasrava*,
and *maha-vedana*?" Bhagavan said, "Yes, Gautama! They are those who have *maha-
karma* up to *maha-vedana*."  The origin of this question arises from the doubt
that these *jivas* are currently in a one-sensed state. They are not yet in that
state, nor do they have the means to perform great sinful acts and great
endeavors, etc. So how can they have *maha-karma*, *maha-kriya*, *maha-pasrava*,
and *maha-vedana*? In resolving this, it is said that these *jivas* have not
been freed from the impressions of the great actions they performed in their
previous births, such as *pranatipat* etc. Therefore, they are still those who
have *maha-kriya*. The cause of *maha-kriya* is *maha-ashrava*. That *maha-
ashrava* was also theirs in their previous births, and they have not been freed
from it. Therefore...  1. *Pran*, *dvitri-chatur* are said, *bhutas* are also
remembered. *Jivas* are to be known as five-sensed, the rest are *sattvas*
mentioned.  2. "Born in the earth body, water body, air body, plant body, and
hell? Bhagavan said, 'Yes' etc." - *Malayavritti*

## Third Section:  Uddesakarthasangrahani Gathaas  [257 Mahamasrava are also
present there. Due to Mahamasrava and Mahakriya, they have abundant
Asatavedaniya Karma, therefore they are Mahakarmi and due to this, they are also
Mahavedani.   Uddesakarthasangrahani Gathaas 64:  1.  **Pudhvi Mogahitta Narga
Sanganamaeva Bahallan / Vikkhambhaparikkhvevano Ganso Ya Phaso Ya // 1 //**
* The number of earths, the extent of hell, and the assembly of Narakas are
vast.  2.  **Tesim Mahalayaye Uvma Devena Hoi Kayavva / Jivaa Ya Poggala
Bakkamati Taaha Sasaya Niraya // 2 //**     * To illustrate their vastness, the
Devata gives an example: Just as there are countless living beings and Pudgalas,
so too are there countless Narakas.  3.  **Uvvaayaparimaanam Avaharucchattameva
Sanghayanam / Santhana Vanna Gandha Phasa Usasamahaare // 3 //**     * Their
size, the highest level of removal, their assembly, their form, color, smell,
touch, and breath are all vast.  4.  **Lesa Vitthi Naane Joguvaoge Taaha

pain: heat and cold.  The earth is vast, and all living beings are born on it.
**These are the Sangrahani Gathaas.**  **The Uddesaka is complete.**  [94] This
Uddesaka discusses the following topics:  * The number of earths * The extent of
hell * The assembly of Narakas * Their thickness, diameter, and circumference *
Their color, smell, and touch * The Devata's analogy to illustrate their
vastness * The transmigration of living beings and Pudgalas within them * The
eternal and non-eternal forms * Their origin (where they are born from) * The
number born at one time * Their removal, height, and assembly * Their form,
color, smell, touch, breath, and food * Their vision, knowledge, yoga, use, and
state of being * Their hunger, thirst, exhaustion, and pain * The birth of the
five great men on the seventh earth * The two types of pain: heat and cold *
Their location, their rising, the touch of the earth, and the birth of all
living beings.  **The second Uddesaka is complete.**

## Third Understanding - Third Objective  The third objective is introduced to
further elaborate on the topic of Niryāṇikas. Its initial sūtra is as follows:
**"The pudgala-pariṇāma of Niryāṇikas is 95."**  **"Bhante! In the realm of
Rāyaṇaprabhā, how do the Niryāṇikas experience pudgala-pariṇāma?"**  **"Gotama!
From the state of Aṇi-jāya to the state of Amaṇāma, and so on, up to the state
of Aheṣattamā, this is the way."**  **"Here, the assembly of humans, the
Kesavas, the aquatic beings, the Mandaḷiyas, the Rāyas, and those who have
undertaken great endeavors, all experience this."** (1)  **"The duration of life
for humans is different, for Tiryaṇmaṇus it is four months, for Devas it is half
a month, and for Niryāṇikas it is a period of intense suffering."** (2)  **"The
pudgalas that are not in accordance with the niyamas become their food. Their
physical form is like a lump of clay, and their niyamas are like a rope."** (3)
**"The Niryāṇikas experience intense suffering, their bodies are disfigured, and
their physical form is like a lump of clay."** (4)  **"They experience intense
suffering, they are constantly tormented, and they are destined for hell."** (5)
**"The Niryāṇikas are born in the realm of Devas due to their past karma, or due
to their present karma."** (6)  **"The lifespan of a Niryāṇika is 500 yojanas.
They experience intense suffering, and their bodies are filled with pain."** (7)
**"They have no happiness, only suffering. They are constantly tormented in
hell."** (8)  **"Those who have subtle bodies and those who have gross bodies,
all experience suffering. They are constantly tormented, and they are destined
for hell."** (9)

## 260] [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra] In hell, the Naryikas experience extreme cold,
extreme heat, extreme hunger, extreme thirst, extreme fear, and hundreds of
sorrows continuously (without stopping). // 10 // These verses mention the
duration of Vikurvana, the transformation of undesirable Pudgalas, inauspicious
Vikurvana, eternal Asata, momentary Sata in the Upapata Kala, jumping up and
down, not having Sata even for the blink of an eye, the disintegration of the
Vaikriya-Sharira, and the hundreds of types of pain experienced by the Naryikas.
// 11 // The third Naryaka Uddeshaka is complete. / The description of the
Naryikas is finished. Discussion - This Sutra and these verses mention the
transformation of the Pudgalas like food, etc., of the Naryika beings. The
transformation of the Pudgalas that the Naryika beings consume is always
inauspicious, Akant, unpleasant, un-Manojnya, and un-Manam. The transformation
of the Pudgalas consumed by the Naryikas from Ratnaprabha to Tamas-Tama:prabha
is always inauspicious. / Similarly, the Sutras related to pain, Leshya, name,
Gotra, Arati, fear, sorrow, hunger, thirst, disease, Ucchvasa, Anutapa, anger,
pride, Maya, greed, Ahar-Sanjna, Bhaya-Sanjna, Maithuna-Sanjna, and Parigraha-
Sanjna should also be mentioned. / That is, the transformation of these twenty
is also inauspicious for the Naryikas, i.e., it is inauspicious, Akant,
unpleasant, un-Manojnya, and un-Manam. Here, the statement of the Parigraha-
Sanjna transformation is in the seventh Sutra related to the Earth, and the
first verse is mentioned after it. Therefore, the word 'Ettha' in the verse
should be taken as the seventh Earth. / The first verse mentions how beings
generally go to this seventh Earth. Those who are Naravrishabha Vasudeva, who
are very glorious, powerful, prosperous, and extremely attached to sensual
pleasures, etc., from an external physical perspective, are often born in this
seventh Earth due to their involvement in many wars, etc., destructive
activities, and their attachment to possessions and pleasures, etc. / Similarly,
those who are like Tandal-Matsya, who are violent and cruel in their intentions,
Vasu, etc., Mandalik kings, and Subhumi, etc., Chakravartis, and those who are
like Kalasokarik, who are householders who undertake great endeavors, are often
born in this seventh Earth. / The word 'Ativayanti' found in the verse indicates
'generally'. (1) The second verse mentions the peak duration of Vikurvana for
the Naryikas and, incidentally, for others as well - the peak Vikurvana for the
Naryikas lasts until the Antarmuhurta Kala. / The peak Vikurvana for the
Tiryanch and humans lasts for four Antarmuhurtas, and the peak Vikurvana for the
Devas lasts for fifteen days (half a month). 1. Sangrahini Verses - Poggal-

## Third Rebirth: The Pudgala Pariṇāma of the Narakas [261]  The Pudgala that is
undesirable is consumed by the Narakas in the form of food and other things.
Their body structure is *Huṇḍa* and that too is of the lowest kind. This is
about the *Bhavadhārṇīya* body because in the *Gāthā* about the *Uttara-
vaikriya* body it is said:  (3) All Narakas have only *Vikurvaṇā* that is
*Aśubha*. Even though they think of creating good *Vikriyā*, due to the arising
of unfavorable karma, their *Vikurvaṇā* is definitely *Aśubha*. Their *Uttara-
vaikriya* body and the *Bhavadhārṇīya* body are devoid of *Sanhanana* because
they are only influenced by bones and the *Uttara-vaikriya* body is also *Huṇḍa-
sanstāna* because from their *Bhavapratyay* arises the *Huṇḍa-sanstāna*
*Nāmakarma*.  (4) In all the Naraka realms, whether a being is in the lowest
state or the highest state, at the time of birth, they experience only *Asāta*.
Due to the continuation of the great suffering experienced at the time of death
in the previous life, they experience *Asāta* from birth. After birth, they also
experience only *Asāta* and they complete the entire Naraka existence in
*Asāta*. There is not even a trace of happiness.  (5) Even though in the above
*Gāthā* it is said that the Narakas experience only suffering, there is a slight
exception. It is explained in this sixth *Gāthā*. Due to *Upapāta*, some Naraka
beings experience *Sāta* at the time of *Upapāta*. Those who in the previous
life attained death naturally without burning or piercing, do not have a very
complex *Pariṇāma*. At that time, they do not have the *Prādhīrupa* (mental)
suffering bound from the previous life, nor the pain caused by the nature of the
realm, nor the pain caused by *Paramādharmika* actions or mutual hostility. In
this situation, due to the influence of suffering, some beings experience
*Sāta*. Due to the influence of the Devas, some beings experience *Sāta* for a
short time due to the influence of the Devas. For example, Baldeva went to
Naraka to alleviate the suffering of Krishna Vasudeva. Similarly, due to the
influence of the previous *Sāṅgatīka* Devas, the Narakas experience *Sāta* for a
short time. After that, according to the rule, they experience the pain caused
by the nature of the realm or other pains.  (6) Due to *Adhyavasāya*, some
Narakas experience *Sāta* at the time of the birth of *Samyaktvā* or even after
that, perhaps due to a special auspicious *Adhyavasāya*, even while experiencing
external pain caused by the realm, etc. The *Āgama* says that at the time of the
birth of *Samyaktvā*, the being experiences joy just like a person born blind
experiences joy when they gain sight. Even after that, while experiencing
external pain caused by the realm, they experience the arising of *Sāta* while
feeling special emotions like *Guṇānumoḍana* of the *Tīrthaṅkaras*, etc. Due to
the experience of karma, the Naraka beings experience *Sāta* for a moment due to
the external cause of the *Kalyāṇaka* of the birth, initiation, knowledge, and
liberation of the *Tīrthaṅkaras*, etc., and due to the cause of the arising of
the *Vipāka* of various *Sāta* *Vedaniya* *Karma*.

[262] [Jiva-Jivami-gama-sutra] The Nairyaika Jivas, when cooked in cauldrons and
pierced with spears, etc., are terrified and writhe in agony, leaping up to five
hundred yojanas. They leap from a minimum of one kos to a maximum of five
hundred yojanas. [7] There is also a reading: "The Nairyaika Jivas, who are
constantly being cooked in the hells, do not even have a moment of happiness,
not even for the blink of an eye. There is only suffering, constant suffering."
[8] The pudgala of the Nairyaika's Vaikriya body is shattered into thousands of
pieces as soon as the Jiva leaves the body. The disintegration of other bodies
is also mentioned in this context. The Tejas Karman body, the Sukshma body
(i.e., the body of the Sukshma Namkarma), the bodies of the Paryapta and
Aparyapta Jivas, the Audarika body, the Vaikriya and Praharaka bodies are also
subtle, not perceptible to the naked eye, and the bodies of the Aparyapta Jivas
disintegrate as soon as they are left by the Jivas. The atoms of their bodies
are shattered. [9] These Naraka Jivas constantly experience hundreds of types of
suffering in the hells, such as extreme cold, extreme heat, extreme thirst,
extreme hunger, extreme fear, etc. [10] After the above ten verses, the eleventh
verse summarizes all that has been said in the previous verses, which is clear
from the original meaning. Thus, the third objective of the Naraka description
is complete. With this, the description of the Nairyaikas is also complete. [1]
"Neraiyanuppamo Gauya Ukkoas Pancajoyanasyai" - this is a reading in some
places.

The third state of existence, the state of the Tiryanchas, is described in the
third section of the Narakoddeshak. This section provides various details about
the Narak (hell) and the Narakas (hell beings). After describing the Narakas,
the first distinction in the four types of beings who end their cycle of births
and deaths, we now discuss the state of the Tiryanchas.   There are 96 types of
Tiryanchas. [1] What are the Tiryanchas? The Tiryanchas are classified into five
categories:  1. Egidiya-Tiryanchas 2. Beiviya-Tiryanchas 3. Teindiya-Tiryanchas
4. Charivya-Tiryanchas 5. Panchidiya-Tiryanchas  What are the Egidiya-
Tiryanchas? The Egidiya-Tiryanchas are classified into five categories: 1.
Pudhavikaiya-Egidiya-Tiryanchas 2. Aakkaiya-Egidiya-Tiryanchas 3. Jalakaiya-

The third understanding: The nature of the Tiryancha (non-human) beings. [265]
There are two types of Tiryancha beings: those that arise from the Samucchima
(water) and those that arise from the Aprajatta (non-water) Samucchima. What are
the Tiryancha beings that arise from the Samucchima? There are two types of
Tiryancha beings that arise from the Samucchima: those that arise from the
Pajatta (water) Samucchima and those that arise from the Aprajatta (non-water)
Samucchima.  What are the Tiryancha beings that arise from the Samucchima? There
are two types of Tiryancha beings that arise from the Samucchima: those that
arise from the Palaya (earth) and those that arise from the Jalaya (water). What
are the Tiryancha beings that arise from the Palaya? There are two types of
Tiryancha beings that arise from the Palaya: those that arise from the Chauppaya
(four-footed) and those that arise from the Parisappa (crawling) Palaya.  What
are the Tiryancha beings that arise from the Chauppaya? There are two types of
Tiryancha beings that arise from the Chauppaya: those that arise from the
Samucchima Chauppaya and those that arise from the Gambhava (birth) Chauppaya.
Just as there are two types of Jalaya, there are also two types of Chauppaya.
What are the Tiryancha beings that arise from the Parisappa? There are two types
of Tiryancha beings that arise from the Parisappa: those that arise from the
Uraga (snake) Parisappa and those that arise from the Bhuya (earth) Parisappa.
What are the Tiryancha beings that arise from the Uraga Parisappa? There are two
types of Tiryancha beings that arise from the Uraga Parisappa: just as there are
two types of Jalaya, there are also two types of Uraga Parisappa. Similarly,
there are two types of Bhuya Parisappa. What are the Tiryancha beings that arise
from the Khahaya (air) Palaya? There are two types of Tiryancha beings that
arise from the Khahaya: those that arise from the Samucchima Khahaya and those
that arise from the Gambhava Khahaya.  What are the Tiryancha beings that arise
from the Samucchima Khahaya? There are two types of Tiryancha beings that arise
from the Samucchima Khahaya: those that arise from the Pajatta Samucchima
Khahaya and those that arise from the Aprajatta Samucchima Khahaya. Similarly,
there are two types of Gambhava Khahaya.  Thus, there are two types of Tiryancha
beings that arise from the Khahaya.  What are the Tiryancha beings that arise
from the Samucchima? There are three types of Tiryancha beings that arise from
the Samucchima: those that arise from the Anda (egg), those that arise from the
Pota (womb), and those that arise from the Samucchima. There are three types of
Anda: Itthi (female), Purisa (male), and Napusaka (neuter). There are three
types of Pota: Itthi (female), Purisa (male), and Napusaka (neuter). Those that
arise from the Samucchima are all Napusaka (neuter).  66. [2] What is the nature
of the two-sense Tiryancha beings?

[266] Honey-eating beings (Hanivajiva) are of two types, namely: sufficient two-
sensed (Dwindriya) and insufficient two-sensed. This is the statement of the
two-sensed non-human beings (Tiryakyonika). Similarly, it should be said for the
four-sensed. What are the five-sensed non-human beings? They are of three types,
namely: aquatic five-sensed (Jalachar Panchendriya Ti.), terrestrial five-sensed
(Sthalachar Panchendriya Ti.) and aerial five-sensed (Khechar Panchendriya
Tiryakyonika). What are the aquatic five-sensed non-human beings? They are of
two types, namely: those born from eggs (Sammuchhim Jalachar Panchendriya Ti.)
and those born from the womb (Garbhavyautkrantik Jalachar Panchendriya Ti.).
What are the egg-born aquatic five-sensed non-human beings? They are of two
types, namely: sufficient egg-born and insufficient egg-born aquatic five-sensed

the womb-born aquatic five-sensed non-human beings? They are of two types,
namely: sufficient womb-born and insufficient womb-born aquatic five-sensed non-
human beings. This is the description of the womb-born aquatic beings. What are
the terrestrial five-sensed non-human beings? They are of two types, namely:
quadruped terrestrial five-sensed (Chatushpad Sthalachar Panchendriya) and
creeping terrestrial five-sensed (Parisarp Sthalachar Panchendriya
Tiryakyonika). What are the quadruped terrestrial five-sensed non-human beings?
They are of two types, namely: egg-born quadruped terrestrial five-sensed and
womb-born quadruped terrestrial five-sensed non-human beings. Just as it was
said in the case of aquatic beings, so also these four types should be known.
This is the statement of the quadruped terrestrial five-sensed non-human beings.
What are the creeping terrestrial five-sensed non-human beings? They are of two
types, namely: snake-like creeping terrestrial five-sensed (Urag Parisarp
Sthalachar Panchendriya Ti.) and serpent-like creeping terrestrial five-sensed
(Bhujag Parisarp Sthalachar Panchendriya Ti.). What are the snake-like creeping
terrestrial five-sensed non-human beings? They are of two types, namely: just as
the four types of aquatic beings were mentioned, so also they should be
mentioned here. Similarly, the four types of serpent-like beings should be
mentioned. This is the statement of the serpent-like beings. With this, the
statement of the terrestrial five-sensed non-human beings is also complete. What
are the aerial five-sensed non-human beings?

## Third Chapter: The Authority of the Transmigratory Beings [267]  There are
two types of transmigratory beings, namely, the **Sammūchhim Khechara
Panchendriya** and the **Garbhavyutkrāntika Khechara Panchendriya**. What are
the **Sammūchhim Khechara Panchendriya**? They are of two types, namely, the
**Paryāpta Sammūchhim Khechara Panchendriya** and the **Aparyāpta Sammūchhim
Khechara Panchendriya**. The same should be said about the
**Garbhavyutkrāntika**.  **O Bhagavan! How many types of Yonisangraha are there
for the Khechara Panchendriya Transmigratory Beings?**  **Gautama! There are
three types of Yonisangraha, namely, Andaja, Potaja, and Sammūchhim.**  **Andaja
are of three types:** Female, Male, and Neuter.  **Potaja are of three types:**
Female, Male, and Neuter.  **Sammūchhim are all Neuter.**  **Discussion:** The
distinctions of the Transmigratory Beings are established in the scriptures,
therefore, there is no need for clarification. Only the clarification of
Yonisangraha is as follows:  **Yonisangraha means the distinction made based on
the Yoni (birth).**  **The birth of birds is of three types:** Those born from
eggs, such as peacocks, etc.; those born from pods, such as wagtails, etc.; and
those born from Sammūchhim, such as sparrows, etc.  **Generally, there are four
types of Yonisangraha:** 1. Jarāyuja, 2. Andaja, 3. Potaja, and 4. Sammūchhim.
**There is no mention of Jarāyuja in birds. However, excluding Andaja, the rest,
both Jarāyuja and Ajarāyuja Garbhaja, are included in Potaja, making three
types of Yonisangraha consistent.**  **Andaja are of all three types:** Female,
Male, and Neuter.  **Potaja are also of all three genders.**  **Sammūchhim born
beings are only Neuter, because their Neuter Veda is definitely manifested.**
**Dvāraprarupaṇā 97. [1] O Bhagavan! How many types of Lesas are there for the
Jivas?**  **Gautama! There are six types of Lesas, namely, Kaṇhaleśa to
Sukkaleśa.**  **O Bhagavan! Are the Jivas Sammadṛṣṭi, Micchāviṭṭhi, or
Sammāmicchāviṭṭhi?**  **Gautama! They are Sammadṛṣṭi, Micchāviṭṭhi, and
Sammāmicchāviṭṭhi.**  **O Bhagavan! Are the Jivas Jñānī, Ajñānī?**  **Gautama!
They are Jñānī, Ajñānī, and possess three types of Jñāna and three types of
Ajñāna.**  **O Bhagavan! Are the Jivas Mana-yogi, Vai-yogi, or Kāya-yogi?**
**Except for Andaja, all other Jarāyuja or Ajarāyuja Garbhavyutkrāntika
Panchendriya are included in Potaja. Therefore, three types of Yonisangraha are
mentioned, not four.**  **Also, there are no Jarāyuja in birds, therefore, three
types of Yonisangraha are mentioned here.**

## Third Chapter: The Authority of the Tiryanch  Gautama! Except for those with
countless years of life, those who have attained the state of non-action
(akarmabhumi), and those who are in the state of Antarvipi, all beings are born
from all places. O Lord! How long is the lifespan of those beings? Gautama! The
lifespan of those beings is countless parts of the lowest (jghanya) to the
highest (utkrista) Palyopama.   O Lord! How many Samudghatas (stages of
existence) are there for those beings? Gautama! There are five Samudghatas,
namely: Vedanasamudghata, etc., up to Taijasasamudghata.   O Lord! Do those
beings die with or without Samvahata (attachment) at the time of death? Gautama!
They die both with and without Samvahata.   O Lord! Where are those beings born
after death? Where do they go? Are they born in the Nairyika (hell) or in the
Tiryanch (animal) realm? Such questions should be asked. Gautama! As it is said
in the Vyutkrantipad (reverse order) of Prajnapanasutra, so it should be said
here. (It is said in the second chapter, see there.)   O Lord! How many lakhs of
Yoni-pramukh (species-leading) Jati-kul-koti (species-family-groups) are there
for those beings? Gautama! There are twelve lakhs of Yoni-pramukh Jati-kul-koti.
The clarity of Leshya (color), Drishti (vision), Jnana (knowledge), Yoga
(concentration), Upayoga (application), etc., found in the Khechar (birds) is
evident from the original text.   The Udvartana (evolution) should be understood
from the Vyutkrantipad. This information is given here. The Vyutkrantipad is in
the Prajnapanasutra, and the Udvartana mentioned there should be understood
here. This is explained in the second chapter of this Jivaabhigamsutra, which
the inquisitive can also see. This Sutra states that there are twelve lakhs of
Yoni-pramukh Jati-kul-koti for Khechar.   The gross example of Jati-kul-yoni has
been explained by the ancient teachers as follows: Jati means Tiryanch-jati
(animal species), its Kul (family) are Krimi (worms), Kiit (insects), Vrishchik
(scorpions), etc.   These Kul are Yoni-pramukh, meaning there are many Kul in
one Yoni. For example, in the six-fold Yoni, there are Krimi-kul, Koti-kul,
Vrishchik-kul, etc. Alternatively, 'Jati-kul' can be considered as one word.
The difference between Jati-kul and Yoni is that there are many Jati-kul in one
Yoni. For example, in the same six-fold Yoni, there are Krimi-jati-kul, Kiit-
jati-kul, and Vrishchik-jati-kul, etc. Thus, due to the difference in species
within the same Yoni, there are many Yoni-pramukh Jati-kul.   Regarding the
Dvaras (gates), the Sangrahini (collection) verse is as follows:   Yoni-sangrah,
Leshya, Ditti, Naane, Ya, Yog, Upayoga, Uvvaaya, Thii, Samudghata, Chayan, Jati-
kul-vihi.   This Sutra discusses Yoni-sangrah, Leshya, Drishti, Jnana, Yoga,
Upayoga, Uvvaaya, Thii, Samudghata, Chayan, and Jati-kul-koti.

## Third Classification: Gandhaanga Praroopana  [271] Their state is inferior to
Antarmukhoorta and superior to the first category of the excellent. If they die
and go to hell, they go to the fifth earth. They have ten lakh Jaatikulkodi.
**Question:** Gautam! What is the Yonisangraha of the quadruped terrestrial
five-sense Tiryaakyonika?  **Answer:** Gautam! Their Yonisangraha is of two
types, namely Jarayuja (Potaj) and Sammoochhima. Jarayuja are of three types,
namely female, male, and eunuch. Those who are Sammoochhima are all eunuchs.
**Question:** O Bhagavan! How many Leshya are said for those beings?
**Answer:** Gautam! It should be said like all the Khechara. The special feature
is that their state is inferior to Antarmukhoorta and superior to three
Palyopama. If they die and go to hell, they go to the fourth hell earth. They
have ten lakh Jaatikulkodi.  **Question:** Gautam! What is the Yonisangraha of
the aquatic five-sense Tiryaakyonika?  **Answer:** Gautam! It should be said
like the Bhujparisho. The special feature is that if they die and go to hell,
they go to the seventh earth. They have twelve and a half lakh Jaatikulkodi.
**Question:** O Bhagavan! How many Jaatikulkodi are said for the four-sense
beings?  **Answer:** Gautam! Nine lakh Jaatikulkodi are said.  **Question:** O
Bhagavan! How many Jaatikulkodi are said for the three-sense beings?
**Answer:** Gautam! Eight lakh Jaatikulkodi are said.  **Question:** O Bhagavan!
How many Jaatikulkodi are said for the two-sense beings?  **Answer:** Gautam!
Seven lakh Jaatikulkodi are said.  **Discussion:** All other statements are
established by the text. Only the Yonisangraha of the quadruped terrestrial
five-sense Tiryaakyonika is said to be of two types, namely Potaj and
Sammoochhima. Here, in Potaj, all the Jarayuja or Ajarayuja Garbhaja beings,
other than the egg-born, are included. Therefore, two types of Yonisangraha are
said. Otherwise, cow etc. are Jarayuja and snake etc. are egg-born - these two
types and one Sammoochhima, thus three types of Yonisangraha are said. But here
only two types are said, therefore, in Potaj, all Jarayuja and Ajarayuja
Garbhaja should be understood.  Up to this point, the statement of Jaatikulkodi
of Yoni-jatiya was made. Now, the opportunity for different jatiya has arrived,
therefore, the Praroopana of different jatiya Gandhaanga is done.  **Gandhaanga
Praroopana 98:**  **Question:** O Bhanta! What is the Gandha Panna?  **Answer:**
O Bhanta! What is the Gandhasaya Panna?  **Answer:** Gautam! The Gandha and
Gandhasaya Panna are seven.  **Question:** O Bhanta! How many Pushpajaatikulkodi
Joonipa-muha-sayasahassa are there?  **Answer:** Gautam! Sixteen
Pushpajaatikulkodi Joonipa-muha-sayasahassa are there, namely four Jalayaana,
four Thalayaana, four Maharakhkiyaana, and four Mahaguummiyaana. But those who
are Ajar...

## Third Chapter: Classification of Fragrant Substances [273 /  The Lord said,
"Gautama! There are seven fragrant substances (gandhang) and seven hundred sub-
species of gandhang. Broadly, the seven gandhang are as follows: 1. Root, 2.
Bark, 3. Wood, 4. Exudate, 5. Leaf, 6. Flower, and 7. Fruit.  "Musta, Valuka,
Usira, etc. are derived from the word 'root'. Suvarna Chhal (gold bark), etc.
are barks. Chandan, Agaru, etc. are derived from wood. Kapoor, etc. are
exudates. From leaves, we have Jatipatra, Tamalpatra, etc. From flowers, we have
Priyangu, Nagar, etc.  "From fruits, we have Jaiphal, Ilayachi, Laung, etc.
These are the seven gandhang in a broad sense.  "When these seven gandhang are
multiplied by five colors, we get thirty-five varieties. These are fragrant, so
when multiplied by one (35 x 1 = 35), we get thirty-five varieties. In each
color variety, five tastes are found due to the difference in substances.
Therefore, multiplying the aforementioned 35 by 5, we get 175 (35 x 5 = 175).
"There are texts that mention touch, but in the aforementioned gandhang, only
four touches - Mad, Lagha, Sheet, and Ushna - are considered in practice.
Therefore, multiplying the aforementioned 175 varieties by 4, we get 700 (175 x
4 = 700) sub-species of gandhang."  After this, a question was asked about the
total number of flower species. In response, the Lord said, "There are 16 lakh
(1.6 million) species of flowers.  "There are four lakh (400,000) species of
flowers that grow in water, such as lotus. There are four lakh (400,000) species
of land-based flowers, such as Korant. There are four lakh (400,000) species of
flowers from large trees, such as Mahua. And there are four lakh (400,000)
species of flowers from large shrubs, such as Jati.  "In this way, sixteen lakh
(1.6 million) species of flowers have been counted. There are four types of
creepers and four hundred sub-species. There are four types of creepers in the
original sense, and four hundred types due to sub-species variations. The four
types are not clearly available.  "The original commentator also did not clarify
them. There are one hundred types of creepers in the original sense and one
hundred sub-species. There are three types of green plants in the original sense
and three hundred sub-species. There are three types of green plants: aquatic,
terrestrial, and amphibious. Each has one hundred sub-species, therefore, three
hundred sub-species of green plants are mentioned.  "There are said to be a
thousand types of fruits with seeds, such as brinjal, and a thousand types of
fruits with a stalk. All these three hundred types and others, as well as all
types of fruits, etc., are found under green plants.  "1. Root, bark, wood,
exudate, leaf, flower, and fruit are the gandhang. They are to be understood by
their color and other differences, as well as their fragrance and taste. // 1 //
"This is the explanation in two verses: Musta, Suvarna Chhal, Agaru, Valuka,
Tamalpatra, etc. are gandhang. // 1 //  "Multiplying by seven hundred, by five
colors, by fragrance, by taste, and by touch, we get the varieties. // 2 //"

## Translation:  [274] The **Jīvānīvāmigamasūtra** states that the
**haritakāya** (green-bodied) belongs to the **vanaspatikāya** (plant body),
which in turn is part of the **sthāvarakāya** (stationary body). The
**sthāvarakāya** is further included within the **jīva** (living beings). Thus,
according to the sūtra, through self-understanding, understanding from others,
contemplation through **arthālochanā** (interpretation), deep thinking through
**yukti** (reasoning), and **pūrvāpara** (previous and subsequent) examination,
all worldly beings are categorized into these two categories: **sakāya** (having
a body) and **sthāvarakāya** (stationary body).  In this context, one should
understand the **prājīva** (living being) analogy. Just as the term "**jīva**"
encompasses all **tras** (mobile beings), **sthāvar** (stationary beings),
**sūkṣma-bādar** (subtle and gross), **paryāpta-aparyāpta** (sufficient and
insufficient), and **ṣaṭkāya** (six categories of beings), similarly, one should
understand that all beings in the world are included within these 84 lakh (8.4
million) **jīvayonīs** (types of births).  The mention of 84 lakh **yonīs** here
is merely an indication. One should understand other **jātikulkoṭi** (categories
of birth) as well. For example, there are 12 lakh birds, 9 lakh
**bhujaparisaṛpa** (reptiles with limbs), 10 lakh **urparisaṛpa** (reptiles
without limbs), 10 lakh quadrupeds, 12.5 lakh aquatic animals, 1 lakh
**caturindriya** (four-sensed beings), 8 lakh **trīndriya** (three-sensed
beings), 7 lakh **dvīndriya** (two-sensed beings), and 16 lakh **puṣpajāti**
(flower-born beings). Combining these, we get 33.5 lakh. Therefore, the mention
of 84 lakh **yonīs** here is merely an indication; there are other **kulkoṭi**
(categories) as well.  Elsewhere, **kulkoṭi** are listed as follows: 12 lakh
**pṛthvīkāya** (earth-bodied), 7 lakh **apkāya** (water-bodied), 3 lakh
**tejasakāya** (fire-bodied), 7 lakh **vāyukāya** (air-bodied), 7 lakh
**dvīndriya** (two-sensed), 8 lakh **trīndriya** (three-sensed), 9 lakh
**caturindriya** (four-sensed), 12.5 lakh **jalacāra** (aquatic), 10 lakh
**sthalačara** (terrestrial), 12 lakh **khečara** (aerial), 10 lakh
**urparisaṛpa** (reptiles without limbs), 9 lakh **bhujaparisaṛpa** (reptiles
with limbs), 25 lakh **nāraka** (hell beings), 26 lakh **devatā** (deities), and
12 lakh **manuṣya** (humans). In total, there are 1 crore 57 lakh (15.7 million)
**kulkoṭi**.  The calculation of 84 lakh **jīvayonīs** can also be understood in
this way: there are 32 lakh **yonīs** for **tras** (mobile beings). This is
broken down as follows: 2 lakh **dvīndriya** (two-sensed), 2 lakh **trīndriya**
(three-sensed), 2 lakh **caturindriya** (four-sensed), 4 lakh
**tiryapanceṇdriya** (five-sensed animals), 4 lakh **nāraka** (hell beings), 4
lakh **dev** (deities), and 14 lakh **manuṣya** (humans). These total 32 lakh
**yonīs** for **tras** (mobile beings).  There are 52 lakh **yonīs** for
**sthāvar** (stationary beings): 7 lakh **pṛthvīkāya** (earth-bodied), 7 lakh
**apkāya** (water-bodied), 7 lakh **tejasakāya** (fire-bodied), 7 lakh
**vāyukāya** (air-bodied), and 24 lakh **vanaspati** (plants). This totals 52
lakh **yonīs** for **sthāvar** (stationary beings).  Combining 32 lakh **tras**
(mobile beings) and 52 lakh **sthāvar** (stationary beings), we get 84 lakh
**jīvayonīs** (types of births).  Regarding **vimāna** (celestial vehicles), the
question is: 99. **Asthi** (Venerable Sir), what are the **vimāna** (celestial
vehicles) like in terms of **sotthiya** (excellence)? What is their **sotthiya-
vattai** (excellence of form), **sotthiya-prabhāi** (excellence of radiance),
**sotthiya-kantāi** (excellence of beauty), **sotthiya-vannāi** (excellence of
color), **sotthiya-lesāi** (excellence of decoration), **sotthiya-jžžayāi**
(excellence of sound), **sotthiya-singārāi** (excellence of adornment),
**sotthiya-kaḍāi** (excellence of construction), **sotthiya-siṭṭāi** (excellence
of arrangement), and **sotthiya-uttaradisagāi** (excellence of direction)?
**Asthi** (Venerable Sir): 1. According to the **ṭīkākara** (commentator), the
reading is "**acchiain pracchiyavattai**" etc.

[Question about Vimanas] [275]  "How big are the Vimanas called Swastika,
Swastikavarta, Swastikaprabha, Swastikakanta, Swastikavarna, Swastikaleshya,
Swastikadhvaja, Swastikashringara, Swastikakuta, Swastikashishta and
Swastikottaravatansaka?" "Gotama, they are." "How big are they, Bhagavan?"
"Gotama, the distance from which the sun rises and the distance from which the
sun sets (this is one Avasantarai), three such Avasantarai-sized areas
constitute one Vikrama (pace) of a Deva. If that Deva travels with that
excellent, swift, divine Deva-speed, for one day, two days, or even for six
months, then he can cross some Vimanas, but not others." "Gotama, these are the
sizes of those Vimanas." "Bhagavan, are there Vimanas called Achi, Achiravart,
etc., up to Achiruttaraavatansaka?" "Yes, Gotama, there are." "How big are those
Vimanas, Bhagavan?" "Gotama, just as there are nine Sotthiyai, five Avasantarai
constitute one Vikrama of a Deva, and so on." "Bhagavan, are there Vimanas
called Kama, Kamavart, etc., up to Kamuttaraavatansaka?" "Yes, Gotama, there
are." "How big are those Vimanas, Bhagavan?" "Gotama, just as there are nine
Sotthiyoni, seven Avasantarai constitute one Vikrama, and so on." "Bhagavan, are
there Vimanas called Vinaya, Vejayanta, Jayanta, Aparajita?" "Yes, Gotama, there
are." "How big are those Vimanas, Bhagavan?" "Gotama, just as the sun rises,
nine Avasantarai, and so on. These Vimanas cannot be crossed. These are the
sizes of the Vimanas, Samanau-so! The Tirkkhajoniyauddeso is complete." [99]

feature is that here, seven avakāśāntara praमाण क्षेत्र should be called one

Are there vimānas called Vijay, Vaijayanta, Jayanta, and Aparājita? Yes,
Gautama! There are. Bhagavān! How large are those vimānas? Gautama! The same
description should be given, except that here, nine avakāśāntara praमाण क्षेत्र

that deva can reach beyond some vimānas and cannot reach beyond some vimānas if
he travels for one day, two days, or up to six months / O Āyushman Śramaṇa!
Those vimānas are said to be that large. The first Tiryaṅyoni Uddesaka is
complete / The discussion in this sūtra is about vimānas with special names and
about their extent / The etymology of the word 'vimāna' has been given by the
Vṛttikāra as follows: where vi-specially, the happiness of those who are gone is
experienced by the virtuous beings, those are vimānas / Here, the names of the
vimānas are first given as Svastika etc., while the Vṛttikāra Malayagiri has
explained by assuming the reading Aci, Aciravārta etc. first. He has mentioned
the names Svastika, Svastikavārta etc. at number two. Thus, there is a
difference in the order of the names / The description is the same. The simile
of a deva has been used to explain the importance of the vimānas. Just as a
deva, in the most excellent day, the area in which the sun rises and the area in
which it sets is called avakāśāntara, so much area (that deva) crosses in one
padanyāsa / With such excellent, swift, and divine speed, if he continues to
travel for one day, two days, and up to six months, then also he reaches beyond
some vimānas and cannot reach beyond some vimānas. Those vimānas are that large.
1. Especially, the virtuous beings experience the happiness of those who are
gone, thus they are vimānas /  For Private & Personal use only

## Third Understanding: Questions about the Vimanas [277]  On the first day of
the Kark Sankranti, the most auspicious day in Jambudvipa, the sun appears to
rise from a distance of forty-seven thousand two hundred sixty yojanas and one
yojana divided into six parts (twenty-one sixtieth parts). 47263 1/10 yojanas is
the extent of its rising point, and the same is the extent of its setting point.
The rising point and the setting point together make a total of 94526 1/10
yojanas. This is the extent of one Avashaantar. Since there are three such
Avashaantars, the total extent of one padanyas of that deva is twenty-eight lakh
three thousand five hundred eighty yojanas and one yojana divided into sixty
parts (28,03,580 1/60).   Even if a deva with such strength were to walk
continuously for one day, two days, or even for the auspicious six months, he
would still be able to cross some of those Vimanas, but not others. These
Vimanas are so large. This is a simile to understand the greatness of Vimanas
like Swastika, etc.   In response to the question about the greatness of Achi,
Achirawart, etc., one should know the same, except that here, the extent of one
padanyas of that deva should be understood as five Avashaantars.   In the case
of Kama, Kamawart, etc., Vimanas, one should also know the same, except that the
extent of one padanyas of that deva should be understood as seven Avashaantars.
The same should be known about Vijay, Vaijayant, Jayant, and Aparajit. The
difference is that here, the extent of one padanyas of that deva should be
understood as nine Avashaantars. O venerable Shraman! These Vimanas are so
large.   ## First Tiryaak Uddeshak Complete  1. **Javi Udai Suro Javi So Athamei
Avarenam / Tiyapanasattanavgunam Kaun Patteyem Patteyem // 1 //**    - The sun
rises and sets in the same way. The distance is to be understood as three times
seven times nine times the Kaun.   2. **Siyalis Sahasssa Do Ya Saya Joyanaana
Tebatta / Igavis Sadvibhaga Kakkhadamaimmi Pechch Nara // 2 //**    - Forty-two
thousand two hundred yojanas and twenty-one sixtieth parts are seen by humans in
the Kakkhadamaimmi.  3. **Evam Dugunam Kaun Gunijjae Tiyapanasattamaaihim /
Magayphalem Cha Jam Tam Kamparimanam Biyaanahi // 3 //**    - Multiply the Kaun
by two and then by three times seven. The result is the extent of the Kama.  4.
**Chattari Vi Sakammehi, Chandaigaihim Janti Chhammas / Tahavi Ya Na Janti Param
Kesinchhi Sura Vimanaai // 4 //**    - Even if they walk for six months with all
their strength and speed, even then, some devas cannot cross some Vimanas.

## Third Classification: Specific Information about Earth-bodied Beings [279]
There are two types of subtle earth-bodied beings: sufficient and insufficient.
This is the statement about subtle earth-bodied beings. What are coarse earth-
bodied beings? There are two types of coarse earth-bodied beings: sufficient and
insufficient. Thus, as stated in the *Prajnapana* text, one should say. There
are seven types of smooth (soft) earth-bodied beings and many types of rough
earth-bodied beings, even countless. This is the statement about coarse earth-
bodied beings. This is the statement about earth-bodied beings. Thus, as stated
in the *Prajnapana* text, one should make the complete statement. The same
should be said about plant-bodied beings, where there may be a countable number,
an uncountable number, or an infinite number of plant-bodied beings. This is the
statement about coarse plant-bodied beings. This is the statement about plant-
bodied beings. What are embodied beings? They are said to be of four types: two-
sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed. What are two-sensed beings?
They are said to be of many types. Thus, as stated in the *Prajnapana* text, one
should make the complete statement until the authority of the *Sarvarthasiddha*
gods is reached. This is the statement about the *Anuttaropapatika* gods. Along
with this, there is the statement about the gods, the statement about the five-
sensed beings, and the complete statement about embodied beings.
**Discussion:** Here, the intention of the teachers who state that there are six
types of beings who end their cycle of existence is explained. 1. Earth-bodied,
2. Water-bodied, 3. Fire-bodied, 4. Air-bodied, 5. Plant-bodied, and 6.
Stationary-bodied - all worldly beings are included in these six categories. In
this context, everything that was said in the previous classifications of
stationary and immobile beings has been said. Therefore, one should know the
statement according to the statement made in the first verse of the *Prajnapana*
sutra, as the sutra-maker has provided information here. Inquisitive people can
obtain specific information from there.  **Specific Information about Earth-
bodied Beings**  101. "Venerable sir, what are the types of earth?" "There are
six types of earth, as follows: sandy earth, pure earth, clay earth, stone
earth, sugar earth, and rough earth."  "Venerable sir, how long does sandy earth
remain in existence?" "For one thousand years, with an interval of one
*muhurta*."  "Venerable sir, how long does pure earth remain in existence?" "For
twelve thousand years, with an interval of one *muhurta*."  "Venerable sir, how
long does clay earth remain in existence?" "For fourteen thousand years, with an
interval of one *muhurta*."  "Venerable sir, how long does stone earth remain in
existence?" "For sixteen thousand years, with an interval of one *muhurta*."
"Venerable sir, how long does sugar earth remain in existence?" "For eighteen
thousand years, with an interval of one *muhurta*."

## Third Chapter: Specific Information Regarding Earth-bodied Beings [281
Discussions]  This sutra presents several specific topics related to Earth-
bodied beings, etc. To address these, questions about Earth are asked again.
In response to a question about the types of Earth, the Lord said that there are
six types of Earth:  1. **Shlakshnaprithvi:** This refers to soft, smooth soil.
It is as soft as powdered flour. 2. **Shuddhaprithvi:** The soil found in the
middle of mountains, etc., is Shuddhaprithvi. 3. **Balukaprithvi:** Fine sand is
Balukaprithvi. 4. **Manahshilaprithvi:** Manahshila, etc., is Manahshilaprithvi.
5. **Sharkaraprithvi:** Gravel, pebbles, etc., are Sharkaraprithvi. 6.
**Kharaprithvi:** Stony Earth is Kharaprithvi.  After describing these six types
of Earth, questions were asked about their duration. The answer stated:  1.
**Shlakshnaprithvi:** Its minimum duration is an Antarmuhurta and its maximum
duration is one thousand years. 2. **Shuddhaprithvi:** Its minimum duration is
an Antarmuhurta and its maximum duration is twelve thousand years. 3.
**Balukaprithvi:** Its minimum duration is an Antarmuhurta and its maximum
duration is fourteen thousand years. 4. **Manahshilaprithvi:** Its minimum
duration is an Antarmuhurta and its maximum duration is sixteen thousand years.
5. **Sharkaraprithvi:** Its minimum duration is an Antarmuhurta and its maximum
duration is eighteen thousand years. 6. **Kharaprithvi:** Its minimum duration
is an Antarmuhurta and its maximum duration is twenty-two thousand years.
**Earth Duration Chart:**  | Earth Type | Minimum Duration | Maximum Duration |
|---|---|---| | Shlakshnaprithvi | Antarmuhurta | One thousand years | |
Shuddhaprithvi | Antarmuhurta | Twelve thousand years | | Balukaprithvi |
Antarmuhurta | Fourteen thousand years | | Manahshilaprithvi | Antarmuhurta |
Sixteen thousand years | | Sharkaraprithvi | Antarmuhurta | Eighteen thousand
years | | Kharaprithvi | Antarmuhurta | Twenty-two thousand years |  Since the
topic of duration is being discussed, questions arise about the duration of
Nairyikas, etc., in the order of the twenty-four Dandakas. These questions and
their answers should be understood according to the fourth position of the
Prajnapanapad, up to the duration of the Devas of Sarvarthasiddha. There is a
detailed description of duration there. Therefore, instead of mentioning it
here, it is suggested to refer to that section.  After discussing the topic of
duration of existence, questions arise about the duration of the body.
**[Verse 1]**  "Shlakshna, Shuddha, Baluka, Manahshila, Sharkara, and
Kharaprithvi. These have durations of twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen, and
twenty-two thousand years respectively."

## 282] [The Sutra on the Approach of the Soul (Jiva) remains / The meaning of
"Kayasthiti" is - to remain in the general or specific form of the soul, which
is the intended synonym / In "Bhavasthiti," the state of the present existence
is assumed, and in "Kayasthiti," the state is intended as long as the soul
remains with its life-form synonym! In the present context, the Kayasthiti of
the soul is asked. The one who sustains life is the soul. There are two types of
life - Dravya-pran and Bhava-pran / Five senses, mind-speech-body these three
forces, lifespan and breathing, these ten are Dravya-pran, and knowledge,
perception, happiness, and vitality, these four are Bhava-pran / Here, both
types of life are taken / Therefore, the meaning of the question is - how long
does the soul remain in the form of life, in terms of sustaining life? The Lord
answered that the soul remains in the form of life for all time. It remains
alive in the worldly state by taking Dravya-Bhava-pran, and in the liberated
state by taking Bhava-pran. Therefore, it remains in the form of life for all
time. There is not a single moment when the soul is devoid of this state of life
/ Or, the word "Jiva" here does not refer to a specific soul, but to the soul in
general / Therefore, there is no fault in considering life-sustaining as the
characteristic of the soul. That is, the soul remains in the form of the soul.
It has always lived, lives, and will continue to live. Thus, Kayasthiti is said
in relation to the general soul, taking the soul / Similarly, in the case of the
Earth-body (Prithvi-kaya) etc., the general meaning should be understood. The
Earth-body will also always remain in the form of the Earth-body, generally,
there will never be a time when there will be no Earth-bodied beings. Therefore,
their Kayasthiti is said to be for all time / Thus, the way Kayasthiti is said
in the eighteenth "Kayasthiti" word of the understanding through the doors of
motion, senses, body, etc., should be said here / These doors are twenty-two: 1.
Soul, 2. Motion, 3. Senses, 4. Body, 5. Yoga, 6. Vedas, 7. Passions, 8. Leshya,
9. Rightness, 10. Knowledge, 11. Perception, 12. Restraint, 13. Use, 14. Food,
15. Speaker, 16. Protection, 17. Sufficient, 18. Subtle, 19. Knower, 20.
Existence-Proving, 21. Existing-Body, and 22. Ultimate / Thus, the Sutras
related to Water-body (Ap), Fire-body (Tejas), Air-body (Vayu), Plant-body
(Vanaspati), and Animal-body (Trasa-kaya) should also be understood like the
Earth-body. The statement related to the non-attachment is 101-2. "O Venerable!
For how long is the Earth-body (Padappanna-puthvikaiya)?" "Go-yama! As many
times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many
times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many

it take for a newly arisen earth-bodied being to become nilapa?" "Gautama! For a
newly arisen earth-bodied being, it takes an innumerable number of utsarpini and
avasarpini kalpas, both in the inferior and superior positions. For a newly
arisen earth-bodied being, there is no nilapa." "Venerable one! How long does it
take for a newly arisen plant-bodied being to become nilapa?" "Gautama! For
newly arisen plant-bodied beings, it cannot be said that they become nilapa in a
certain amount of time, in either the inferior or superior positions. These
beings cannot become nilapa." "Venerable one! How long does it take for a newly
arisen water-bodied being to become nilapa?" "Gautama! For a newly arisen water-

both in the inferior and superior positions. It should be understood that there
is a significant difference between the inferior and superior positions."

## 284] [Jiva-jiva-abhigamsutra] _ In the same way, one should understand the
nirlepanā of the newly arisen apkāyika, tejaskāyika, and vāyukāyika jivas. In
response to the question regarding the nirlepanā of newly arisen vanaspatikāyika
jivas, it has been said that their nirlepanā is not possible in either the
jghanyapada or the utkrishtpada. Because these jivas are anantananta /
Therefore, it is not possible to say "they will become nirlipta or apahrita in
this much time" / They cannot be said by the above-mentioned pada, therefore
they are called 'ayada'. The time of nirlepanā for newly arisen trasakāyika
jivas is sāgaropamashatapṛthaktva in the jghanyapada, meaning that their apahara

## Third Proposition: Statement of the Ascetic with Impure Leshya  (285) "Does
the Ascetic with Impure Leshya know and see the Dev, Devi, and Ascetic with
Impure Leshya through a soul free from the defilement of pain, etc.?  Gautama!
This meaning is not supported, i.e., he does not know or see."  (103) "Does the
Ascetic with Impure Leshya know and see the Dev, Devi, and Ascetic with Pure
Leshya through a soul free from the defilement of pain, etc.? Gautama! This
meaning is not supported."  "Does the Ascetic with Impure Leshya know and see
the Dev, Devi, and Ascetic with Impure Leshya through a soul with the defilement
of pain, etc.? Gautama! This meaning is not supported."  "Does the Ascetic with
Impure Leshya know and see the Dev, Devi, and Ascetic with Impure Leshya through
a soul with the defilement of pain, etc.? Gautama! This meaning is not correct."
"Does the Ascetic with Impure Leshya know and see the Dev, Devi, and Ascetic
with Impure Leshya through a soul that is neither completely free from the
defilement of pain, etc., nor completely bound by it? Gautama! This meaning is
not supported."  "Does the Ascetic with Impure Leshya know and see the Dev,
Devi, and Ascetic with Pure Leshya through a soul that is both bound and
unbound? Gautama! This meaning is not supported."  "Does the Ascetic with Pure
Leshya know and see the Dev, Devi, and Ascetic with Impure Leshya through a soul
that is unbound by the defilement of pain, etc.? Yes, Gautama! He knows and
sees."  "Just as six Palapas are mentioned for the Ascetic with Impure Leshya,
so too six Palapas should be mentioned for the Ascetic with Pure Leshya. Does
the Ascetic with Pure Leshya know and see the Dev, Devi, and Ascetic with Pure
Leshya through a soul that is both bound and unbound? Yes, Gautama! He knows and
sees."  "In the previous Sutra, the state of being and the absence of
defilement, etc., were mentioned. The Ascetic with Pure Leshya understands this
statement correctly, while the Ascetic with Impure Leshya does not understand it
correctly..."

[286] [The text from the Jiva-Jiva-Migam Sutra does not explain this. / In this
context, questions related to knowledge and perception have been raised
regarding the Angara with pure Leshya and the Angara with impure Leshya. Impure
Leshya refers to Krishna-Neela-Kapota Leshya. Asamvahat means devoid of
suffering and other disturbances, and Samvahat means having suffering and other
disturbances. / Samvahat-Asamvahat means neither completely having nor
completely devoid of suffering and other disturbances. / Regarding the Angara
with impure Leshya, six Palapakas have been stated as follows: (1) Knowing the
Devadi with impure Leshya while being Asamvahat, (2) Knowing the Devadi with
pure Leshya while being Asamvahat, (3) Knowing the Devadi with impure Leshya
while being Samvahat, (4) Knowing the Devadi with pure Leshya while being
Samvahat, (5) Knowing the Devadi with impure Leshya while being Samvahat-
Asamvahat, (6) Knowing the Devadi with pure Leshya while being Samvahat-
Asamvahat. / In all these six Palapakas, knowing and seeing the Angara with
impure Leshya is prohibited. Because due to impure Leshya, that Angara does not
know or see any object correctly. Regarding the Angara with pure Leshya, six
Palapakas should be stated in the same way as mentioned above, and in all of
them, knowing and seeing the Devadi objects should be stated. The Angara with
pure Leshya knows and sees objects correctly. / Due to pure Leshya, there is
correct knowledge and perception, otherwise not. The original commentator has
said that the Angara with pure Leshya knows the beautiful or ugly object in its
true form. / Suffering is not an obstacle for him. / His suffering is also not
extremely ugly. The implication is that the Angara with impure Leshya does not
know or see objects in the right perspective, while the Angara with pure Leshya
knows and sees objects correctly.   104. "Annuthiya Nam, Bante! They think this
way, they speak this way, they understand this way, they perceive this way. /
And indeed, a single Jiva performs two actions at the same time, such as -
Sammattakriya and Micchattkriya. / When he performs Sammattakriya, he also
performs Micchattkriya, and when he performs Micchattkriya, he also performs
Sammattakriya. / Due to the performance of Sammattakriya, he performs
Micchattkriya, and due to the performance of Micchattkriya, he performs
Sammattakriya."

## Third Proposition: The impossibility of simultaneous Samyak-Kriya and Mithya-
Kriya  [287] The other-worldly ones say, speak, explain, and declare that "one
being performs two actions at the same time, Samyak-Kriya and Mithya-Kriya. When
they perform Samyak-Kriya, they also perform Mithya-Kriya, and when they perform
Mithya-Kriya, they also perform Samyak-Kriya. They perform Mithya-Kriya while
performing Samyak-Kriya, and they perform Samyak-Kriya while performing Mithya-
Kriya. Thus, one being performs two actions at the same time, namely Samyak-
Kriya and Mithya-Kriya."  O Bhagavan! What is the nature of their statement?  O
Gautama! Those other-worldly ones who say, speak, explain, and declare that one
being performs two actions at the same time, Samyak-Kriya and Mithya-Kriya, are
speaking falsely.  O Gautama! I say and declare that one being performs only one
action at a time, either Samyak-Kriya or Mithya-Kriya. When they perform Samyak-
Kriya, they do not perform Mithya-Kriya, and when they perform Mithya-Kriya,
they do not perform Samyak-Kriya. They do not perform Mithya-Kriya while
performing Samyak-Kriya, and they do not perform Samyak-Kriya while performing
Mithya-Kriya. Thus, one being performs only one action at a time, either Samyak-
Kriya or Mithya-Kriya.  This is the second refutation of the Tiryanch-yonik
authority. [104]  **Discussion:** This sutra refutes the belief of the other-
worldly ones that a being can perform both Samyak-Kriya and Mithya-Kriya
simultaneously. The other-worldly ones state, elaborate, explain, and firmly
declare that "one being performs both Samyak-Kriya and Mithya-Kriya at the same
time."

[288] The *jivajivaabhigamsutra* exists and also performs *mithyakriya*. The
action with beautiful *adhyavasaya* is *samyakriya* and the action with ugly
*adhyavasaya* is *mithyakriya*. At the time when the *jiva* performs
*samyakriya*, it also performs *mithyakriya*, and at the time when it performs
*mithyakriya*, it also performs *samyakriya*. Because the nature of the *jiva*
is to perform both actions. The *jiva* has the nature of performing both actions
in a combined form. Therefore, whatever good or bad action the *jiva* is
inclined towards, its nature of performing both actions remains present. Due to
the nature of performing both actions, its action is also of both forms. When
milk and water are mixed, it must be called of both forms, not one form.
Therefore, at the time when the *jiva* is performing *samyakriya*, the tendency
of its nature of performing both actions is also happening, otherwise, the
tendency cannot be complete. Due to the tendency of the nature of performing
both actions, at the time when *samyakriya* is happening, *mithyakriya* is also
happening, and at the time when *mithyakriya* is happening, *samyakriya* is also
happening. Therefore, a *jiva* can perform both actions at the same time -
*samyakriya* and *mithyakriya*. The belief of these *anyatheethikas* is false.
The Lord says, "O Gautama! A *jiva* can perform only one action at a time -
*samyakriya* or *mithyakriya*. It cannot perform both actions together because
there is mutual avoidance and opposition between them. If *samyakriya* is
happening, then *mithyakriya* cannot happen, and if *mithyakriya* is happening,
then *samyakriya* cannot happen. The *jiva* does not have the nature of
performing both actions. If the nature of performing both actions is assumed,
then *mithyatva* will never cease, and in such a situation, there will be a lack
of liberation. Therefore, it is proven that when performing *samyakriya*, it
does not perform *mithyakriya*, and when performing *mithyakriya*, it does not
perform *samyakriya*. *Samyakriya* and *mithyakriya* leave each other, they
cannot exist together. Therefore, this is the correct principle that a *jiva*
can perform only one action at a time - *samyakriya* or *mithyakriya*, both
actions are never possible together. // The second *uddeshaka* in the
*tiryakyonika* authority of the third *pratipatti* ends. //

After discussing the rights of the Tiryanchikas in the third chapter, now the
rights of humans, which are in order, are discussed. Its first sutra is 105.
"What are humans?" "Humans are of two types, namely: 1. Sammuchhima humans and
2. Garbhavyutkrantika humans." [105] "O Bhagavan! How many types of humans are
there?" "Gautama! Humans are of two types, namely: 1. Sammuchhima humans and 2.
Garbhavyutkrantika humans." [105] "O Bhagavan! How many types of Sammuchhima
humans are there?" "Gautama! Sammuchhima humans are of only one type." "O
Bhagavan! Where are these Sammuchhima humans born?" "Gautama! In the human realm
(born in 14 impure places), etc., as described in the Prajnapanasutra, should be
said here completely until the discussion of Sammuchhima humans is complete."
Discussion: The Prajnapanasutra's first chapter provides a detailed description
of the 14 impure places of birth of Sammuchhima humans and their lifespan of
only a few moments, etc. This has already been discussed in the second chapter
of this Jeevajeevaabhigamsutra. [106] The curious can refer to it. [106] "O
Bhagavan! How many types of Garbhavyutkrantika humans are there?" "Gautama!
Garbhavyutkrantika humans are of three types, namely: 1. Karmabhumika, 2.
Akarmabhumika, and 3. Prantípika." [107]

## 29.] [Jīvā Jīvābhigama Sūtra 108. How many types of Antaradīvaga are there?
Antaradīvaga are twenty-eight types, such as - Ekoruk, Ābhāṣik, Vaiṣāṇik,
Nāngolik, Hayakarna etc., Ādarshamukha etc., Aśvamukha etc., Aśvakarna etc.,
Ukkamukha etc., Ghanadanta etc., up to Śuddhadanta. [108]  O Bhagavan! How many
types of Prāntīpik humans are there? Gautama! Prāntīpik are twenty-eight types,
such as - Ekoruk, Ābhāṣik, Vaiṣāṇik, Nāngolik, Hayakarna etc., Ādarshamukha
etc., Aśvamukha etc., Aśvakarna etc., Ukkamukha etc., Ghanadanta etc., up to
Śuddhadanta.  **Explanation:** In the present Sūtras, after mentioning the three
types of Garbhaja humans - Karmabhūmik, Akarmabhūmik and Antarvīpik, it is also
mentioned in an unsequential manner (astyānānupūyampi), i.e., in a non-
sequential order. Based on this principle, questions and answers have been given
regarding Antaradīpik. Due to the presence of islands within islands inside the
salt ocean, they are called Antaradīp, and the humans residing in them are
called Antarapik based on the principle of "Tātsthyāt Tavyapadeshaḥ", just like
the men residing in Punjab are called Punjabis. Prāntīpik humans are of twenty-
eight types, namely: 1. Ekoruk, 2. Ābhāṣik, 3. Vaiṣāṇik, 4. Nāngolik, 5.
Hayakarna, 6. Gajakarna, 7. Gokarna, 8. Śaṣkulikarna, 9. Prādarshamukha, 10.
Meṇḍhamukha, 11. Ayomukha, 12. Gomukha, 13. Aśvamukha, 14. Hastimukha, 15.
Simhamukha, 16. Vyāghramukha, 17. Aśvakarna, 18. Simhakara, 19. Akara, 20.
Karṇaprāvaraṇa, 21. Ukkamukha, 22. Meghamukha, 23. Vidyutdanta, 24. Vidyujjihva,
25. Dhanadanta, 26. Laṣṭadanta, 27. Gūḍhadanta and 28. Śuddhadanta. The humans
residing in these islands are also known by the same name. The detailed
description of these Prāntīpik is given in the following Sūtras. The description
of the Ekoruk island of the Ekoruk humans is given in 109.  **109.** O Bhagavan!
Where is the island called Ekoruk, the abode of the Ekoruk humans in the
southern direction?

## Third Chapter: Description of the Ekoruk Island of the Ekoruk Humans  [291] O
Gautama! South of Mount Meru in Jambudvipa, three hundred yojanas into the salt
sea from the extreme northeast of the Chull (Ksulla) Himavan mountain, a
landmass called Ekoruk Island is said to be the home of the Ekoruk humans. This
island is three hundred yojanas in length and breadth, and its circumference is
slightly more than nine hundred and fifty yojanas. It is surrounded by a
Padmavaravedika and a forest. This Padmavaravedika is eight yojanas high, five
hundred dhanus wide, and encircles the Ekoruk Island on all sides. The
description of this Padmavaravedika is as follows: its foundation is made of
vajra, etc. The description of the vedika should be understood as in the
Rajaprashniyasutra.  The discussion here is about the Ekoruk Island of the
Ekoruk humans in the south. The Ekoruk humans are also found on the Shikhari
mountain, but they are located in the north of Mount Meru. The adjective "in the
south" is used here to distinguish them. Where is the Ekoruk Island of the
Ekoruk humans in the south? This is the essence of the question. The answer is
that this Ekoruk Island of the Ekoruk humans in the south is located three
hundred yojanas into the salt sea from the extreme northeast (ishan kona) of the
Chull Himavan mountain, south of Mount Meru in Jambudvipa. This Ekoruk Island is
three hundred yojanas in length and breadth, and its circumference is slightly
more than nine hundred and fifty yojanas. It is surrounded by a Padmavaravedika,
and around that, a forest. This Padmavaravedika is eight yojanas high and five
hundred dhanus wide. Its description should be understood as the same as the
Padmavaravedika described in the Rajaprashniyasutra. For example, its foundation
is made of vajra gems, etc.  The description of the Padmavaravedika and the
forest should be understood as the same as the description of the
Padmavaravedika and the forest in front of the Jagati of Jambudvipa, as
described by the Sutrakar himself. Therefore, that description is not given
here.  [110] This Padmavaravedika is completely surrounded by a forest. This
forest is two yojanas in diameter, with a circumference equal to the vedika.
This forest is very green and dense, appearing black and black-colored. The
description of this forest should be understood as in the Rajaprashniyasutra.
The color, smell, touch, sound of the grass, as well as the wells, the
utpataparvat, the earth-stone-slab, etc., should also be described. There are
many Vanavyantara Devas and Devis who rise and sit there, and they wander around
experiencing happiness.

[292] Description of the Ekorukdvipa 111. [1] O Bhagavan! How is the land of
Ekorukdvipa described? _ Gautama! The inner land of Ekorukdvipa is said to be
very flat and beautiful. _ Just as the skin of a Mruj (a type of drum) is flat,
so is the land there. _ Similarly, one should also mention the softness of a bed
or describe the earth-stone slab. On that stone slab, many men and women of
Ekorukdvipa rise and sit, experiencing the fruits of their past good deeds. _
The present sutra describes the land structure of Ekorukdvipa. The land there is
perfectly flat. Various similes are used to describe this flatness. _ The sutra
explicitly states 'Pralingapukkharei va', which means 'Aaling', meaning Mruj. _
Mruj is a type of drum. _ Pushkar means skin. _ Just as the skin of a Mruj and
drum is perfectly flat, so is the land of Ekorukdvipa perfectly flat and
beautiful. _ The word 'Yavat' should be understood to include other similes,
such as the smooth and flat surface of a drum, the flat surface of water in a
full pond, the palm of the hand, the moon, the sun, the surface of a mirror,
etc. _ Just as the skin of sheep, bull, deer, lion, tiger, wolf, and cheetah is
made extremely flat by stretching it with large nails, so is the land there
extremely flat and beautiful. That land is adorned with various auspicious forms
like Pravart, Pratyavart, Shreni, Prasreni, Swastik, Sovastik, Pushyaman,
Vardhaman, Matsyand, Makarand, Jar Mar Puspavali, Padmapatra, Sagar Tarang,
Vasanti Lata, Padmalata, etc., and is beautiful, with beautiful radiance,
beautiful splendor, shining bright rays, and light, adorned with various types
of five-colored grasses and gems. _ That land is soft to the touch. To describe
this soft touch, one should mention the bed. The implication is that the land is
soft to the touch like deer skin, cotton, wool, butter, and cotton. _ That land
is full of gems, clean, smooth, rubbed, polished, free from stones, pure,
spotless, free from pebbles, bright, beautiful, radiant, auspicious, beautiful
to look at, and a model.

## Third Rebirth: The Kalpavriksha named Chitrang and Chitraras  **[297]**
Shining lightning, blazing fire without smoke, pure heated gold from fire, the
cluster of blooming Kinshuk, Ashoka and Japa flowers, the rays of gem-stones,
the group of excellent Hingulu, all appear radiant with their respective colors
and forms. Similarly, those Jyotishikha (Jyotishka) Kalpavriksha are adorned
with their many types of diverse Visrasa outcomes, shining brightly. Their light
is pleasant, not sharp but soft, their heat is not intense. Just as the peaks of
mountains remain in one place, so too do these remain in their own place.
Intermingling with their light, they illuminate, brighten and radiate the
objects in their domain from all sides. These Kalpavriksha are devoid of Kusha-
Vikusha and other such things at their roots, and are extremely beautiful due to
their splendor.  **[5]** **[8]**  O Venerable Shraman! In that Egoruk island,
there are many Kalpavriksha named Chitrang, scattered here and there. Just as a
theater (Natya Shala) is adorned with various paintings, is delightful, is
bright with garlands of excellent flowers, is beautiful with scattered clusters
of blooming flowers, is adorned with garlands of various types of intertwined
flowers, and is extremely captivating due to the brilliance of the beauty of the
garlands, which are tied together by skilled artists, and are arranged with
great skill on all sides, and is adorned with garlands of five colors hanging
far apart, and is radiant with a garland of flowers hanging in the front, so too
are those Chitrang Kalpavriksha adorned with many, numerous and diverse Visrasa
outcomes, and are adorned with garlands. They are devoid of Kusha-Vikusha at
their roots, and are extremely beautiful due to their splendor.  **[6]**
**[111]** **[9]**  O Venerable Shraman! In that Egoruk island, there are many
Kalpavriksha named Chitraras, scattered here and there. Just as a fragrant,
beautiful, and delightful Kalmasali, which is difficult to obtain, is extremely
sweet due to the presence of the essence of sugar, jaggery, and honey, and is
the best in terms of color and fragrance, or just as a chariot is adorned with
skilled, well-dressed, and beautiful Sun-worshippers, and is adorned with
Kalmasali, which is spread out like a canopy, and is adorned with various types
of fragrant substances, and is adorned with many garlands, or just as a well-
filled treasure chest is adorned with various types of fragrant substances, so
too are those Chitraras Kalpavriksha adorned with fragrant substances, and are
powerful due to their Visrasa outcomes.

can enter and exit those buildings comfortably, the steps (rows) of the ascent
of those buildings are close together, being spacious, comfortable movement and
approach is possible in them, and they are congenial to the mind. They are those
banyan trees endowed with various kinds of buildings. Their roots are devoid of
kush and vikush, and they are extremely resplendent with beauty.  [12] O

The **Ivani-Abhigamsutra** describes the physical characteristics of women in
the following way:  Their limbs are slender at the bottom, like the tail of a
serpent, round, equal in size, and joined together at their joints. They are
graceful, extremely desirable, and beautiful. Their nails are copper-colored.
Their palms are fleshy, their fingers strong, soft, and excellent. The lines on
their hands are smooth. Their hands have distinct and well-formed lines
representing the Sun, Moon, Conch, Wheel, and Swastika. Their chest and abdomen
are full and prominent. Their cheeks are plump, their necks are four finger-
breadths long and resemble a beautiful conch. Their chins are fleshy,
beautifully shaped, and auspicious. Their lower lip is red like a pomegranate
flower, bright, strong, and slightly full, making it look good. Their upper lip
is beautiful. Their teeth are white like curd, water droplets, the moon, tubers,
and spring buds, and are without any holes. Their palate and tongue are red like
a lotus leaf, soft, and delicate. Their nose is straight, prominent, upright,
and sharp like a Nerium flower bud. Their eyes are beautiful, with some white,
some red, and some dark shades, like the open petals of a lotus in autumn and a
blue lotus blooming in moonlight, and are marked with black pupils in the
middle. Their eyes are fringed with eyelashes, lively, long reaching to the
ears, and slightly reddish (copper-colored). Their eyebrows are slightly curved
like a bow, beautiful, black, and of the same size as the clouds, long, well-
formed, black, and smooth. Their ears are slightly attached to the head and
well-proportioned. Their cheeks (the area between the cheek and ear) are fleshy,
smooth, and pleasing. Their forehead is square, broad, and flat. Their face is
pure and full like the moon on Kartik Purnima. Their head is elevated like an
umbrella. Their hair is curly, smooth, and long.   They possess the following
thirty-two auspicious marks: 1. Umbrella, 2. Flag, 3. Dice, 4. Stupa, 5.
Garland, 6. Water Pot, 7. Pitcher, 8. Well, 9. Swastika, 10. Banner, 11. Barley,
12. Fish, 13. Pitcher, 14. Excellent Chariot, 15. Makara (mythical sea
creature), 16. Parrot's Perch, 17. Goad, 18. Eight-legged Spider, 19. Well-
established Foundation, 20. Peacock, 21. Garland, 22. Elephants Bathing Lakshmi,
23. Torana (archway), 24. King of the Earth, 25. Ocean, 26. House, 27. Palace,
28. Mirror, 29. Beautiful Elephant, 30. Bull, 31. Lion, and 32. Fly Whisk.
These women of the Ekavruk Island walk like swans. They have sweet voices and
tones like the cuckoo, are charming, and loved by all. Their bodies do not
wrinkle, and their hair does not turn white. They are free from deformities,
discolouration, diseases, misfortune, and sorrow. They are slightly shorter than
men. They are naturally adorned and wear excellent clothes. They are skilled in
graceful walking, laughter, speech, gestures, elegance, conversation, and proper
treatment and behaviour. Their breasts, hips, face, hands, feet, and eyes are
very beautiful. They are beautiful in complexion, graceful, youthful, and
elegant. They are as wondrous to behold as the Apsaras who roam in Nandana Van
(heavenly garden). These women bring joy to the beholder, are beautiful,
attractive, and exemplary.

## Third Rebirth: Description of the Men of the Ekahohaka Island  [307] O
Bhagavan! How often do those women desire food?  Gautama! They desire food every
other day, that is, on the fourth day.   [111] (15) O Bhagavan! What kind of
food do those men eat?  Gautama! Those men of the Manaygana clan eat earth,
flowers, and fruits, O Shraman!   O Bhagavan! What is the taste of that earth?
Gautama! It tastes like jaggery, sugar candy, sugar, mishri, lotus root,
parpatmodak, sugar made from special flowers, sugar made from special lotuses,
akositha, vijaya, maha-vijaya, adarshopama, anopma (these are special sweet
substances).   Or, the taste of that earth is like the milk of four cows that
have been milked four times and have been fed four times. The milk of these four
cows is given to three cows, the milk of these three cows is given to two cows,
and the milk of these two cows is given to one cow. The milk of that one cow is
called four times transformed and four-fold transformed.   What is the taste of
those flowers and fruits?  Gautama! The taste of those flowers and fruits is
like the taste of a sweet dish made from four times transformed and four-fold
transformed sugar candy, prepared with the best ingredients, and served in a
forest with a hundred thousand trees, with a fragrant aroma, with a delicious
taste, and with a sweet flavor. It is also like the taste of a sweet dish made
from twenty, twenty, ten, ten, five, five, two, two, and one times transformed
and four-fold transformed sugar candy.   Is that not so, O Shraman?   O
Bhagavan! Those men of the Manaygana clan live in tree houses, O Shraman!   O
Bhagavan! What are the features of those trees?  Gautama! Those trees have
features like a cage, a viewing room, a roofed room, a hundred features, a
feature of a tree, a feature of a gate, a feature of a tower, a feature of a
wall, a feature of a balcony, a feature of a passage, a feature of a courtyard,
a feature of a well, a feature of a pillar, a feature of a wall, and many other
features that are suitable for resting, sleeping, and sitting. Those men of the
Manaygana clan live in those trees, O Shraman!

[308] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra] Is the taste of cow's milk, which has been
transformed into a sweet dish by adding jaggery, sugar, and mishri, cooked on a
slow fire, and possessing auspicious color, fragrance, taste, and touch, similar
to the taste of cow's milk? Gautama! This is not supported. The taste of that
earth is even more desirable and pleasing.  /  O Bhagavan! What is the taste of
the flowers and fruits there? Gautama! Like the food of the Chaturanga
Chakravarti, known as Kalyana Bhojan, which is produced from a lakh cows, which
is of the best color, fragrance, taste, and touch, is worthy of tasting, is
worthy of tasting again and again, which is deepaniya (digestive), vahaniya
(nourishing), darpaneya (enhancing enthusiasm), madaniya (intoxicating), and
which is enjoyable to all the senses and the body, is that the taste of those
flowers and fruits? Gautama! This is not right. The taste of those flowers and
fruits is even more desirable, radiant, dearer, pleasing, and more pleasing. O
Bhagavan! How do they live in such dwellings after consuming such food? Ayushman
Gautama! Those humans live in trees transformed into houses.  /  Bhagavan! What
is the shape of those trees? Gautama! They are shaped like the peak of a
mountain, like a theater, like an umbrella, like a flag, like a stupa, like a
toran, like a gopura, like a vedika, like a chopyal (intoxicated elephant), like
an attalika, like a royal palace, like a haveli, like a window, like a water
palace, like a Vallabhi (house with balconies), and O Ayushman Shraman! There
are also trees there which are of various types of buildings, beds, seats, etc.,
and have a pleasant cool shade. 111. (16) Are there any houses or house-like
structures on that island, Bhante?  /  Those human beings live in tree-houses,
Shramanausho!  /  Are there any villages, towns, or settlements on that island,
Bhante?  /  Those human beings live in the desired world, Shramanausho!  /  Are
there any artisans, laborers, farmers, merchants, or traders on that island,
Bhante?  /  Those human beings live in a state of complete freedom from all
kinds of work, Shramanausho. 1. If the milk of one lakh cows that graze on the
sugarcane of the Pund jati is given to fifty thousand cows, and the milk of
those fifty thousand cows is given to twenty-five thousand cows, and so on, in a
sequence of giving milk to half the number of cows, the milk of the last cow in
that sequence, made into kheer with various nuts and other ingredients, is
called the Kalyana Bhojan of the Chakravarti.

island?  O Gautama!  This meaning is not supported.  O Ayushman Shraman!  Those
people live on trees that have become like houses.  O Bhagavan!  Are there
villages, cities, or settlements in the Ekoruk island?  O Ayushman Shraman!
There are no villages, etc. there.  They are free to move as they wish.  O
Bhagavan!  Are there weapons, writing materials, agriculture, goods, and trade
in the Ekoruk island?  O Ayushman Shraman!  These things are not there.  They
are free from weapons, writing materials, agriculture, goods, and trade.  O
Bhagavan!  Are there silver, gold, bronze, clothes, gems, pearls, and abundant
wealth, gems, pearls, conch shells, stones, corals, and other precious materials
in the Ekoruk island?  Yes, Gautama!  There are, but those people do not have a
strong attachment to them.  O Bhagavan!  Are there kings, princes, gods
(enjoying worldly pleasures), sword-bearers (officials who wear golden swords
given by the king), Mandaviks (owners of deserted dwellings), Kombikas, Ibyas
(wealthy people), Sethas, generals, and Sarthavahahs (leading merchants who
travel to other countries with many merchants) in the Ekoruk island?  O Ayushman
Shraman!  All these things are not there.  They are free from the behavior of
wealth and respect, meaning that everyone is equal there, there is no
inequality.

[318] There are twenty-eight Antardvipas and fifty-six Antarvipas. The Himavan
mountain is the boundary between the Bharat and Haimvat regions in Jambudvipa.
It touches the Lavanasamudra from its east and west ends. / From the point where
the Lavanasamudra water touches, two tusk-shaped teeth protrude in the east-west
direction. The tooth that protrudes in the northeast corner has an island called
Akoruk, 300 yojanas long and wide and slightly more than 949 yojanas in
circumference, in the Lavanasamudra at a distance of 300 yojanas from the
Himavan mountain. / It is adorned on all sides by a Padmavaravedika, 300 dhanus
wide and two kos high. From the end of the same Himavan mountain, in the
southeast corner, at a distance of 300 yojanas, one finds another tooth, on
which there is an island called Abhashik, as long and wide as the Akoruk island.
From the west end of the same Himavan mountain, in the southwest direction
(Nairitakoona), after entering the Lavanasamudra for 300 yojanas, one finds a
tooth, on which there is an island called Langoolik of the same size. And from
the west end of the same Himavan mountain, in the northwest direction (Vayavya
Koona), at a distance of 300 yojanas in the Lavanasamudra, one finds a tooth, on
which there is an island called Vaishanik of the same size as mentioned earlier.
Thus, these four islands are in the four directions from the Himavan mountain
and are of equal size. Their shape, nature, and manifestation are clear from the
original text. 112. "Bante! What is the name given to the island of the
Hayakanna humans in the south?" "Go-yama! The Hayakanna island is named after
the Hayakanna humans who live in the south, at a distance of four hundred
yojanas from the Lavanasamudra, at the southernmost end of the Egolyadvipa, in
the north-west direction. It is four hundred yojanas long and wide, and its
circumference is twelve hundred yojanas and a little more. / It has a
Padmavaravedika like the Egolyadvipa. / "Bante! What about the island of the
Gajakanna humans in the south?" "Go-yama! The Abhasiyadvipa is named after the
Gajakanna humans who live in the south, at a distance of four hundred yojanas
from the Lavanasamudra, at the southernmost end of the Abhasiyadvipa, in the
south-east direction. It is the same as the Hayakanna island. / / "What about
the island of the Gokaranna humans?" "The Vesanivvipa is named after the
Gokaranna humans who live in the south, at a distance of four hundred yojanas
from the Lavanasamudra, at the southernmost end of the Vesanivvipa, in the
south-west direction. It is the same as the Hayakanna island. / "What about the
island of the Safkulik humans?" "Go-yama! The Gangolyadvipa is named after the
Safkulik humans who live in the south, at a distance of four hundred yojanas
from the Lavanasamudra, at the southernmost end of the Gangolyadvipa, in the
north-west direction. It is the same as the Hayakanna island. / "What about the
island of the Ayansamuh humans?" "The Ayansamuh island is named after the
Ayansamuh humans who live in the south, at a distance of five hundred yojanas
from the Lavanasamudra, at the southernmost end of the Hayakanna island, in the
north-west direction. / It is five hundred yojanas long and wide; the Prasamuh
humans are six hundred yojanas, the Asakanna humans are seven hundred yojanas,
the Ukkamuh humans are eight hundred yojanas, and the Ghanvant humans are nine
hundred yojanas."

## Translation:  [320] Gautama! Four hundred yojanas from the northwestern
extremity of the Langoolik island in the salt sea, there is an island called
Shakulikarna. The rest of the description should be understood like the
Hayakarna humans. O Lord! What about the Adarshamukha humans? Gautama! Five
hundred yojanas from the northeastern extremity of the Hayakarna island, there
is an island called Adarshamukha, inhabited by the Dakshinatya Adarshamukha
humans. It is five hundred yojanas long and wide. Four islands, starting with
Ashvamukha, are located six hundred yojanas further, four islands starting with
Ashvakarna are located seven hundred yojanas further, four islands starting with
Ulkamukha are located eight hundred yojanas further, and four islands starting
with Ghanadanta are located nine hundred yojanas further. The circumference of
the Ekoroot island and others should be understood as slightly more than nine
hundred and seventy-five yojanas, and the circumference of the Hayakarna and
others should be understood as slightly more than twelve hundred and sixty-five
yojanas. // 1 // The circumference of the Adarshamukha and others is slightly
more than fifteen hundred and eighty-one yojanas. In this way, these four
islands are of equal measure in each group. The difference in Avagahan,
Vishkambha, and Pariidhi should be understood. The Avagahan, Vishkambha, and
Pariidhi of the first, second, third, and fourth groups have been stated. The
fourth group has a Praayam-Vishkambha of six hundred yojanas and a Pariidhi of
slightly more than 1897 yojanas. The fifth group has a Praayam-Vishkambha of
seven hundred yojanas and a Pariidhi of slightly more than 2213 yojanas. The
sixth group has a Praayam-Vishkambha of eight hundred yojanas and a Pariidhi of
slightly more than 2529 yojanas. The seventh group has a Praayam-Vishkambha of
nine hundred yojanas and a Pariidhi of slightly more than 2845 yojanas. The
Avagahan is the same as the Praayam-Vishkambha. (The Pariidhi of the second
group is 316 yojanas more than the first group, and the Pariidhi should be
increased by 316-316 yojanas in this order. The word "Visheshadhik" should be
used with all.) // 2 // O Auspicious Shraman! The rest of the description should
be understood like the Ekoroot island, up to the Shuddhadant island, until those
humans are born in the Devaloka. O Lord! Where is the Ekoroot island, inhabited
by the Ekoroot humans of the north direction, mentioned? Gautama! Three hundred
yojanas from the northeastern extremity of the Shikhari Varshadhara mountain,
north of the Meru mountain in the Jambudvipa island, in the salt sea, there is
an island called Ekoroot, inhabited by the Ekoroot humans of the north
direction. The rest of the description should be understood like the Ekoroot
island of the south direction, with the difference that these are located in the
Vidishas of the Shikhari Varshadhara mountain. The description should be made in
this way. The description should be made up to the Shuddhadant island. This is
the complete description of the Antaradvipa humans. Discussion: The description
of the four Antaradvipas, Ekoroot, Prabhashik, Langoolik, and Vaishanik, has
been done in the discussion of the previous Sutra. Four hundred yojanas further
from these four islands, starting with Ekoroot, in each Vidisha, in the order of
northeast, etc., there are four islands, each four hundred yojanas long and
wide, with a circumference of slightly more than 1265 yojanas, adorned with the
aforementioned Padmavaravedika and Vanakhanda, and four hundred yojanas away
from the Jambudvipa, there are Hayakarna, Gajakarna, Gokarna, and...

## Third Chapter: Description of Devas [327]  In these abodes, many
aforementioned abode-dwelling Devas reside. There are ten categories of these
abode-dwelling Devas - starting with Asurakumaras and ending with
Stanitakumaras.   The marks inscribed on the crowns or ornaments of the Devas of
these ten categories are as follows: 1. Chudamani, 2. Naga's hood, 3. Garuda, 4.
Vajra, 5. Crown marked with a full Kalash, 6. Lion, 7. Makara, 8. Hosti's mark,
9. Superior horse, and 10. Vaddha Manak (Sikora).  These abode-dwelling Devas,
marked with the aforementioned signs, are beautiful, with great intellect, great
radiance, great strength, great fame, great influence, and immense happiness.
They have chests adorned with garlands, arms adorned with bracelets and armlets,
ear ornaments touching their cheeks, and ear-lobes adorned with earrings. They
wear various ornaments on their hands, diverse flower garlands, and crowns on
their heads. They wear auspicious, excellent clothes, and are adorned with
auspicious, superior garlands and unguents. They have radiant bodies, wear long
flower garlands, and illuminate the ten directions with their divine color,
divine fragrance, divine touch, divine power, divine nature, divine wealth,
divine radiance, divine brilliance, divine splendor, divine light, divine
brilliance, and divine aura. They rule over their respective abodes, their
thousands of Samanik Devas, their almost thirty Devas, their Lokapalas, their
chief consorts, their councils, their armies, their army commanders, their
protectors, and many other abode-dwelling Devas and Devis. They perform and
cause to be performed the duties of leadership, priesthood, governance, and
generalship, and while doing so, they enjoy divine and enjoyable pleasures,
accompanied by the great sound produced by divine dancing, singing, musical
instruments, stringed instruments, drums, cymbals, flutes, and Dhanamridanga.
Generally, after the questions and answers regarding the dwelling places of the
abode-dwelling Devas, a specific question was asked about the dwelling place of
the Asurakumaras. In response, it was said that there are sixty-four lakh abodes
of Asurakumar Devas in a region of one lakh seventy-eight thousand yojanas,
excluding one thousand yojanas above and below the Ratnapraba earth. These
abodes are round on the outside, square on the inside, and have a base
resembling the petals of a lotus. One should understand the description of these
abodes as before.  Many Asurakumar Devas reside in these abodes. They are black,
have eyes like red rubies, lips like Bimba fruit, teeth like white flowers,
black hair, wear one earring on their left ear, have bodies smeared with wet
sandalwood, wear extremely fine clothes, resembling Silindhra flowers, which are
slightly red and do not cause any discomfort. They have crossed the first stage
of youth (Kumar) and are in the second stage of youth (Bhadra Yauvana), not yet
reaching the third stage. They have arms adorned with beautiful ornaments, such
as Talabhangaka (armlet), Trutita (arm protector), and other superior ornaments,
and are adorned with pure gems and jewels. They have fingers adorned with ten
rings, wear crowns marked with Chudamani, are beautiful, have great intellect,
great radiance, great fame, great influence, great happiness, and chests adorned
with garlands. The rest of their description is as before. They enjoy divine and
enjoyable pleasures.

[330] What is the position of the gods in the inner council of Asura king
Chamar? What is the position of the gods in the middle council and what is the
position of the gods in the outer council? What is the position of the goddesses
in the inner council, the middle council and the outer council? Gautama! The
position of the gods in the inner council of Asura king Chamar is 2.5 palyopama,
the position of the gods in the middle council is 2 palyopama and the position
of the gods in the outer council is 1.5 palyopama. The position of the goddesses
in the inner council is 1.5 palyopama, the position of the goddesses in the
middle council is 1 palyopama and the position of the goddesses in the outer
council is 0.5 palyopama.  /  O Lord! Why is it said that Asura king Chamar has
three councils - Samita, Chanda and Jata?  /  The inner council is called
Samita, the middle council is called Chanda and the outer council is called
Jata? Gautama! The gods in the inner council of Asura king Chamar come when
called, they do not come without being called.  /  The gods in the middle
council come when called and also come without being called. The gods in the
outer council come without being called.  /  Gautama! The second reason is that
Asura king Chamar, when any kind of high-low, auspicious-inauspicious family
work arises, consults with the inner council, takes their consent. He informs
the middle council about his decided work, explaining the reasons etc. to them
clearly and he wanders giving instructions to the outer council. For this
reason, O Gautama! It is said that Asura king Chamar has three councils -
Samita, Chanda and Jata. The inner council is called Samita, the middle council
is called Chanda and the outer council is called Jata.  [119.]  "Where, O
Venerable One, are the abodes of the Asura princes?" "Just as in the city of
Thana, there are many houses, so also are there many abodes of the Asura king."
"O Venerable One, how many councils are there of the Asura king?" "There are
three councils, namely - Samita, Chanda and Jata. The inner one is Samita, the
middle one is Chanda and the outer one is Jata." "O Venerable One, how many
thousands of gods are there in the inner council of the Asura king? How many
thousands of gods are there in the middle council and how many hundreds of gods
are there in the outer council?" "O Venerable One, there are twenty thousand
gods in the inner council of the Asura king.  1. Two collection verses
describing the number and position of the council - Twenty-four, twenty-eight,
thirty-two thousand gods of Chamar, the three are prominent, and there are also
two and a half hundred gods.  /  Two and a half, two, one and a half, in order,
the position of the gods, one and a half, two, the position of the goddesses in

## Third Question: The Statement of the Naga Kumaras  [333] "Bhūyānanda, tell
me, how long do the Naga Kumaras stay in the inner circle of the Naga Kumaras'
abode? How long do the Devis stay in the outer circle?  "Gotama, the Devas in
the inner circle of the Naga Kumaras stay for a little more than half a
*paliovam*, the Devas in the middle circle stay for half a *paliovam*, and the
Devas in the outer circle stay for a little less than half a *paliovam*. The
Devis in the inner circle stay for half a *paliovam* less than a *desoon*, the
Devis in the middle circle stay for a little more than a quarter *paliovam*, and
the Devis in the outer circle stay for a quarter *paliovam*.  "The meaning is
like that of the *chamara* [elephant's tail]. The *pravesas* [entrances] of the
*veṇudevas* [flute-playing Devas] and others, with their great noise and speed,
should be understood as being without any particular time, like the *parisa*
[circle] of the *parṇa* [leaf] and *bhūyānanda* [abundant joy]. The *parisa* is
like the *parṇa* and *bhūyānanda*. The *vāhiṇilla* [those who do not carry] are
like the *parṇa* [leaf], and the *uttarilla* [those who do not answer] are like
*bhūyānanda*. The *parimāṇa* [quantity] and *sthiti* [duration] are also fixed."
[120] "O Bhagavan, where are the abodes of the Naga Kumaras mentioned?"
"Gotama, one should know the statement as it is mentioned in the *sthānapad*
[place-chapter]. The question of the abode of the Naga Kumaras in the south
should also be asked, where the Naga Kumarendra and Naga Kumararāja Dhṛṇa reside
and enjoy divine pleasures."  "O Bhagavan, how many *parisa* [circles] does the
Naga Kumarendra Naga Kumararāja Dhṛṇa have?"  "Gotama, three *parisa* are
mentioned. Their names are the same as those mentioned for the *parisa* of the
*chamarendra* [elephant-tail king]."  "O Bhagavan, how many thousand Devas are
there in the inner *parisa* of the Naga Kumarendra Naga Kumararāja Dhṛṇa? How
many hundred Devis are there in the outer *parisa*?"  "Gotama, there are sixty
thousand Devas in the inner *parisa* of the Naga Kumarendra Naga Kumararāja
Dhṛṇa, seventy thousand Devas in the middle *parisa*, and eighty thousand Devas
in the outer *parisa*. There are 175 Devis in the inner *parisa*, 150 in the
middle *parisa*, and 125 in the outer *parisa*."  "How long is the duration of
the Devas in the inner *parisa* of the Naga Kumararāja Dhṛṇa? How long is the
duration of the Devas in the middle *parisa* and the outer *parisa*? How long is
the duration of the Devis in the inner *parisa*, the middle *parisa*, and the
outer *parisa*?"  "Gotama, the duration of the Devas in the inner *parisa* of
the Naga Kumararāja Dhṛṇa is a little more than half a *paliovam*, the duration
of the Devas in the middle *parisa* is half a *paliovam*, and the duration of
the Devas in the outer *parisa* is a little less than half a *paliovam*. The
duration of the Devis in the inner *parisa* is half a *paliovam* less than a
*desoon*, the duration of the Devis in the middle *parisa* is a little more than
a quarter *paliovam*, and the duration of the Devis in the outer *parisa* is a
quarter *paliovam*."  "The meaning of the three types of *parisa* should be
understood like the previous statement about the *chamarendra*."

the inner council, 200 Devis in the middle council and 175 Devis in the outer
council. O Bhagavan! What is the extent of the Devas in the inner council of
Naga Kumarendra, Naga Kumararaj, Bhutananda? What is the extent of the Devis in
the outer council? Gautama! The extent of the Devas in the inner council of
Bhutananda is Deshona Palyopama, the extent of the Devas in the middle council
is slightly more than half Palyopama and the extent of the Devas in the outer
council is half Palyopama. The extent of the Devis in the inner council is half
Palyopama, the extent of the Devis in the middle council is Deshona half
Palyopama and the extent of the Devis in the outer council is slightly more than
a quarter Palyopama. The meaning of the councils should be known like that of
Chamarendra. The rest, starting from Venudeva and ending with Mahaghosh, should
be described completely according to the description of the location. There is a
difference in the councils, which is as follows: The council of the Indra, the
lord of the abode in the South direction, should be described like that of
Dharanendra and the council of the Indra, the lord of the abode in the North
direction, should be described like that of Bhutananda. The number and extent of
the Devas and Devis in the councils should also be known in the same way.
Discussion: The present sutras describe the abodes, councils, evidence of the
councils and extent of the Asura Kumaras and Naga Kumaras, the lords of the
abodes, which is clear from the original text. Further, there is information
about the residents of the abodes like Suparna Kumaras, etc., which should be
known like that of Dharanendra and Bhutananda. The description of the lords of
the abodes in the South direction should be known like that of Dharanendra and
the description of the lords of the abodes in the North direction should be
known like that of Bhutananda. There is a difference in the number of abodes,
names of the Indras and their quantity, etc., in these lords of the abodes,
which has been described by the previous teachers in seven verses, the meaning
of which is as follows: 1. Chausatthi Asuraanam Chulasiicheva Hoi Naagaanam /
Baavattari Suvanne Vayukumaaraanam Chhannauh // 1 // (Rest on the next page)

## The Authority of the Inner and Outer Realms of the Third Stage of Liberation
**121.** "Venerable Sir, what is the arrangement of the abodes (earthly
mansions) of the gods of the inner realms? As long as they dwell in the place of
their abode."  "Venerable Sir, what is the arrangement of the abodes of the gods
of the Pisacaya realm? As long as they dwell in the place of their abode."
"Venerable Sir, the two Pisacaya Kumaras, the sons of the Pisacaya King, dwell
and remain in the realm of the Great Time."  "Venerable Sir, when the time comes
for the Pisacaya Kumaras to be born, the Pisacaya Kumari, the daughter of the
Pisacaya King, dwells and remains in the great abode."  "Venerable Sir, how many
periods are there in the time of the Pisacaya Kumari and the Pisacaya Kumaras?"
"Gotama, there are three periods: the Isa, the Tudya, and the Bhadarha. There is
the inner Isa, the middle Tudya, and the outer Bhadarha."  "Venerable Sir, how
many days are there in the inner period of the Pisacaya Kumari and the Pisacaya
Kumaras? How many days are there in the outer period?"  "Gotama, in the inner
period of the Pisacaya Kumari and the Pisacaya Kumaras, there are eight thousand
days. In the middle period, there are five thousand days. In the outer period,
there are twelve thousand days. In the inner period, there is one day. In the
middle period, there is one day. In the outer period, there is one day."
"Venerable Sir, how long do the gods dwell in the inner period of the Pisacaya
Kumari and the Pisacaya Kumaras? How long do the gods dwell in the middle
period? How long do the gods dwell in the outer period? How long do the gods
dwell in the outer period?"  "Gotama, in the inner period of the Pisacaya Kumari
and the Pisacaya Kumaras, the gods dwell for an entire half-palya. In the middle
period, the gods dwell for a half-palya. In the outer period, the gods dwell for
a quarter-palya. In the inner period, the gods dwell for a quarter-palya. In the
middle period, the gods dwell for a quarter-palya. In the outer period, the gods
dwell for a quarter-palya."  "The eighth is the one who is the best of the best.
And so on, in the same way, until the last one."

[338] Jivajivaabhigamsutra [121]  O Bhagavan! Where are the abodes (earthly
cities) of the Vanavyantara Devas said to be? As it is said in the Sthanapad,
one should state it, as long as they wander enjoying divine pleasures. O
Bhagavan! Where are the abodes of the Pisacha Devas said to be? As it is said in
the Sthanapad, one should state it, as long as they wander enjoying divine
pleasures. There, two Pisacha Kumar Rajas named Kala and Maha Kala reside, as
long as they wander. O Bhagavan! Where are the abodes of the Pisacha Kumaras of
the south direction said to be? One should state it, as long as they wander
enjoying pleasures. There, the great Pisacha Kumar Indra Pisacha Kumar Raja
resides, as long as they wander enjoying pleasures. O Bhagavan! How many
councils does the Pisacha Kumar Indra Pisacha Raja Kala have? Gautama! There are
three councils. They are as follows: Isha, Trutita, and Dridharatha. The inner
council is called Isha. The middle council is Trutita, and the outer council is
called Dridharatha. O Bhagavan! How many thousand Devas are there in the inner
council of the Pisacha Kumar Indra Pisacha Raja Kala? How many hundred Devis are
there in the outer council? Gautama! There are eight thousand Devas in the inner
council of the Pisacha Kumar Indra Pisacha Raja Kala, ten thousand Devas in the
middle council, and twelve thousand Devas in the outer council. There are one
hundred Devis in the inner council, one hundred in the middle council, and one
hundred in the outer council as well. O Bhagavan! What is the extent of the
Devas of the inner council of the Pisacha Kumar Indra Pisacha Raja? What is the
extent of the Devas of the middle council and the outer council? What is the
extent of the Devis of the outer council? Gautama! The extent of the Devas of
the inner council of the Pisacha Kumar Indra Pisacha Raja Kala is half a
Palyopam, the extent of the Devas of the middle council is half a Palyopam, and
the extent of the Devas of the outer council is slightly more than a quarter
Palyopam. The extent of the Devis of the inner council is a Palyopam, the extent
of the Devis of the middle council is a quarter Palyopam, and the extent of the
Devis of the outer council is slightly more than a quarter Palyopam. The meaning
of the councils should be stated like the statement of Chamarendra. Similarly,
one should state about the Vanavyantaras of the north direction. All the above
statements should be stated up to the Gandharva Indra named Giteyash.
Discussion: This Sutra contains questions and answers regarding the earthly
cities of the Vanavyantaras. The question is asked: Where are the abodes
(earthly cities) of the Vanavyantara Devas? In the answer, it is informed to
state according to the second Sthanapad of the Prajnapanasutra. In short, the
description given in the Prajnapanasutra is as follows: Above the one thousand
Yojan thick Ratnamay Kand of this Ratnaprabahaprithvi, after descending one
hundred Yojan and leaving one hundred Yojan below, there are countless earthly
(like earth houses) lakhs of cities of the Vanavyantara Devas in the middle
eight hundred Yojan.

## Third Rebirth: The Authority of the Vanavyantara [339]  These [cities] are
round on the outside, square on the inside, and are constructed with a
foundation like the seed of a lotus. They are surrounded by deep and wide
ditches and moats. They are equipped with ramparts, atalaka (covered halls),
doors, toranas (gateways), and gateways, as described in Sutra 117. These
buildings are pleasing, beautiful, and well-proportioned. Many Vanavyantara
gods, including Pisacha, reside in these cities. These gods are very fickle,
playful, and fond of humor due to their restless minds. They are deeply attached
to serious laughter, songs, and dances. They are adorned with garlands of
flowers, kalangi (a type of head ornament), crowns, earrings, and other
ornaments as they desire. Their chests are adorned with long, beautiful, and
blooming garlands of various flowers, made from fragrant flowers that bloom in
all seasons. They enjoy sensual pleasures as they desire, possess forms and
bodies as they wish, wear various colors, and wear the finest, varied, and
bright clothes. They are fond of amusement, love (sexual play), quarrels, games,
and noise. They are full of laughter and conversation. They carry swords, maces,
spears, and lances in their hands. They are adorned with various symbols made of
many gems and jewels. They are powerful, radiant, glorious, strong, noble,
capable, happy, and have chests adorned with garlands. Their arms are strong and
bound with bracelets. Angada (a type of ornament) and earrings touch their
cheeks. They wear ear ornaments. Their bodies are extremely radiant. They wear
long garlands. They move about, illuminating and radiating the ten directions
with their divine color, divine fragrance, divine touch, divine solidity, divine
form, divine power, divine radiance, divine brilliance, divine shadow (luster),
divine fire (light), divine energy, and divine aura. They rule over their
millions of earth-dwelling city dwellers, their thousands of Samanika gods,
their chief queens, their councils, their armies, their army commanders, their
protectors, and many other Vanavyantara gods and goddesses. They enjoy divine
pleasures with great festivity, dancing, singing, and playing musical
instruments like the veena, tal (cymbals), taal (rhythm), trutit ghan (a type of
drum), mridanga (a type of drum), and other instruments, creating a great sound.
This description is general for the Vanavyantara. In particular, the description
of the Pisacha and other Vanavyantara should be understood in the same way. That
is, in those earth-dwelling cities, the Pisacha gods rule over their own
buildings, Samanika gods, and goddesses. In these cities, two Pisacha kings,
Kala and Maha Kala, reside. They are powerful, radiant, and enjoy divine
pleasures. Kala is the king of the Pisacha in the southern region, and Maha Kala
is the king of the Pisacha in the northern region. Kala, the Pisacha king, rules
over countless earth-dwelling cities like millions of cities, four thousand
Samanika gods, four chief queens, three councils, seven armies, seven...

[340] The commander-in-chief of the Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamata army, who commands
sixteen thousand primary protectors of the gods, and many gods and goddesses
from the southern direction, wanders around. The Pisacha-chandra, the king of
the Pisachas, has three councils: Isha, Trutita, and Dridharatha. The inner
council is called Isha, the middle council is called Trutita, and the outer
council is called Dridharatha. The inner council has eight thousand gods, the
middle council has ten thousand gods, and the outer council has twelve thousand
gods. The number of goddesses in all three councils is the same - one hundred.
Their positions are as follows: The gods of the inner council have a position of
half a Palyopam. The gods of the middle council have a position of a little more
than half a Palyopam. The gods of the outer council have a position of a little
more than a quarter of a Palyopam. The goddesses of the inner council have a
position of a little more than a quarter of a Palyopam. The goddesses of the
middle council have a position of a quarter of a Palyopam. The goddesses of the
outer council have a position of a little more than a quarter of a Palyopam. The
meaning of the councils should be understood in the same way as it was said in
the case of Chamarendra, etc. The description of the later Pisacha-kumar gods is
also similar to that of the southern ones. Their Indra is Mahakal. Mahakal's
description is the same as that of Kal. Similarly, the description of the
Bhutas, up to the Gandharva-devas' Indra, Gitayash, is the same. There is a
difference in this description, with each having their own Indra. The difference
in Indras is described in two verses as follows: (1) Two Indras of the Pisachas
- Kal and Mahakal (2) Two Indras of the Bhutas - Surup and Pratirup (3) Two
Indras of the Yakshas - Purnabhadra and Manibhadra (4) Two Indras of the
Rakshasas - Bhima and Maha-bhima (5) Two Indras of the Kinnaras - Kinnara and
Kimpurusha (6) Two Indras of the Kimpurushas - Satpurusha and Mahapurusha (7)
Two Indras of the Atikayas - Atikaya and Maha-kaya (8) Two Indras of the
Gandharvas - Giterati and Gitayash 1. Kale ya Maha-kale Suruv-padiruv

## Third Section: Description of the Vimanas of the Jyotishka Devas [341]  It
has been said that among the two Indras, the first is the Indra of the Devas in
the southern direction, and the second is the Indra of the Vanavyantara Devas in
the northern direction. Here, the authority of the Vanavyantara Devas ends.
Further, information about the Jyotishka Devas is given.  **Description of the
Vimanas of the Jyotishka Devas [122]**  "O Bhagavan! Where are the Vimanas of
the Jyotishka Devas located?"  "O Bhagavan! Where do the Jyotishka Devas
reside?"  "Gautama! Above the islands and oceans, and from the very level and
beautiful land of this Ratnapraba earth, going up seven hundred and ninety
yojanas, in a region of one hundred and ten yojanas in height, there are
countless lakhs of Vimanas of the Jyotishka Devas, called Jyotishi-Vimanas, in a
slanting position. (This has been said by me and other previous Tirthankaras)."
"These Vimanas are of the shape of a half-Kabiṭa - and so on, as described in
the Sthānapada. There, the Jyotishkendra, Jyotishkarāja, Chandra and Surya, the
two Indras, reside and enjoy great pleasures."  "O Bhagavan! How many Parisadas
are there for the Jyotishkendra, Jyotishkarāja Surya?"  "Gautama! Three
Parisadas are mentioned, namely: Tumba, Truṭita and Pretya. The inner Parisada
is called Tumba, the middle Parisada is called Truṭita, and the outer Parisada
is called Pretya. The rest of the description should be understood like that of
the Kala Indra. Their quantity (number of Devas and Devis) and position should
also be understood in the same way. The meaning of Parisada should be understood
like that of the Chamarendra. According to the statement of Surya, the statement
of Chandra should also be understood."  **Discussion:** From the very level and
beautiful land of this Ratnapraba earth, going up seven hundred and ninety (790)
yojanas...

The Jyotishka Kshetra is located at a height of one hundred and ten Yojanas from
the surface of the earth, within the outer boundary of the
Jeevajeevaabhigamsutra, and extends for countless Yojanas diagonally. This
celestial realm is home to countless lakhs of Jyotishka Vimanas, the aerial
vehicles of the Jyotishka Devas. These Vimanas are shaped like half a Kabitha,
entirely made of crystal. They are white in color, with a radiant glow, and rise
up from the front, extending in all directions. They are adorned with various
jewels, gold, and gems, making them beautifully intricate. They are adorned with
victory flags, banners, and umbrellas, and are very tall, reaching the sky. They
are studded with jewels in their lattices and shine brightly like objects
revealed after removing a cage. They are adorned with mounds of jewels and gems,
and have blooming hundred-petaled and lotus flowers. They are beautifully
decorated with tilak marks and crescent moons made of jewels, and adorned with
garlands of various jewels. They are smooth both inside and outside, and their
bases are adorned with golden hairs. They are pleasant to touch, prosperous,
beautiful, joyful, visible, attractive, and extremely beautiful. Many Jyotishka
Devas reside in these Vimanas, including Brihaspati, Chandra, Surya, Shukra,
Shani, Rahu, Dhumeketu, Budha, and Angaraka (Mangal). They are all slightly
reddish in color, like heated, tempered gold. These Jyotishka Devas, along with
the planets that roam the Jyotishka Kshetra, the constellations that are
constantly in motion, the stars of five colors in various shapes, and the
celestial bodies that move, travel, and rotate endlessly, all reside in these
Vimanas. Each of them has a symbol of their name on their crown. They are all
very powerful and roam, illuminating all ten directions. These Jyotishka Devas
rule over their lakhs of Vimanas, their thousands of Samanika Devas, their chief
consorts, their councils, their armies and army commanders, their thousands of
self-protecting Devas, and many other Jyotishka Devas and Devis. Among them,
Chandrama and Surya, the Jyotishka Kendra and Jyotishka Raja, are the two
Indras, who are very powerful and illuminate all ten directions. They rule over
their lakhs of Vimanas, their four thousand Samanika Devas, their four chief
consorts, their three councils, their seven armies and army commanders, their
sixteen thousand self-protecting Devas, and many other Jyotishka Devas and
Devis. These two Indras, Surya and Chandra, have three councils each. Their
names are Tumba, Trutita, and Pretya. The inner council is called Tumba, the
middle council is called Trutita, and the outer council is called Pretya. The
number of Devas and Devis in these councils and their positions should be known
like the Kal Indra. The meaning of the councils should be understood according
to the description of the Adi Adhikar Chamarendra. The authority of Chandrama
should be understood in the same way as that of Surya.

"Where, O Blessed One, are the Island-Oceans situated?" "How many, O Blessed
One, are the Island-Oceans?" "How large, O Blessed One, are those Island-
Oceans?" "What is the shape, O Blessed One, of those Island-Oceans?" "What is
the nature of their shape, O Blessed One?" "Gautama, the Island beginning with
Jambudvipa and the Ocean beginning with the Salt Ocean, are all of one shape,
being circular. They are of many kinds in terms of their extent, being twice as
large as the previous one, with waves appearing, adorned with many lotuses,
padmas, kumudas, nalins, beautiful, fragrant, pundarikas, maha-pundarikas,
satapatras, sahasrapatras, with their blooming pollen, each surrounded by a
lotus-platform, and each surrounded by a forest-section. O Ayushman Shraman, in

## Third Chapter: The Statement of Islands and Seas in the Context of the
Tiryanch Lok  [345] The Jambudvipa is surrounded on all sides by a group of
lattices (jalī) which are spread out in all directions. This group of lattices
is half a yojana high, five hundred dhanus wide, made of all precious gems,
pure, soft, smooth, beautiful, and very beautiful.  In the Tiryanch Lok, the
Jambudvipa is the first of the islands and seas. It is the beginning of the
islands and seas, and their end is in the Svayambhu Ramanasamudra. Therefore,
the Jambudvipa is the innermost of all the islands and seas. It is the smallest
because all the seas and islands beyond it are twice as large as the previous
one.  Beyond the Jambudvipa is the Lavanasamudra, which is two lakh yojanas
wide. Beyond that is the Dhatukikhand, which is four lakh yojanas wide. In this
way, the size doubles with each successive sea and island.  The Jambudvipa is
spherical in shape. This roundness is explained through similes. It is round
like a malpua cooked in oil. A malpua cooked in ghee does not have the same
roundness as one cooked in oil, hence the epithet "tellapay" (cooked in oil).
Another simile is that of a chariot wheel. The Jambudvipa is round like a
chariot wheel. The third simile is that of a lotus seed. It is round like a
lotus seed. The fourth simile is that of a full moon. The Jambudvipa is round
like the full moon. It is not round like a bangle.  The Jambudvipa is one lakh
yojanas long and wide, and its circumference (parikshep gheeraav) is three lakh
sixteen thousand two hundred twenty-seven (316227) yojanas, three kos, one
hundred twenty-eight dhanus, and slightly more than thirteen and a half angulas.
(The circumference is approximately three times the diameter).  Around the
Jambudvipa is a jagati, which is like the rampart of a city. The jagati is eight
yojanas high and twelve yojanas wide at the base, four yojanas wide in the
middle and at the top, meaning it is shaped like a raised go-puccha (tail of a
cow). It is entirely made of precious gems. It is pure like light and crystal,
smooth like a cloth made of fine threads because it is made of smooth particles,
smooth like a crumpled cloth, polished like a stone statue rubbed with a smooth
stone, free from natural dust, free from external dirt, free from blemishes like
darkness, free from shadows because of its bright light, impressive in its form,
beautiful in its unique beauty, full of rays of light, illuminating external
objects, pleasing to the mind, not tiring the mind or the eyes when looked at,
therefore it is worth seeing. Its form is very attractive to those who see it.
Its form remains as new as ever, therefore it is a prototype.  This jagati is
surrounded by a lattice (jalaktak). Just as there are windows and skylights in
the walls of a building, there are lattices all around. This group of lattices
is two kos high and five hundred dhanus wide. This is the measurement of one
lattice. This jalaktak (group of lattices) ...

The Third Discourse: Description of the Padmavaravedika [From 347]  "What is a
Padmavaravedika, Venerable Sir?"  "Well, a Padmavaravedika is a platform, a
platform where, in that particular place, in those particular regions, in those
particular Vedikas, in those particular Vedika-bhaasas, in those particular
Vedika-sisa-phalas, in those particular Vedika-pudantaras, in those particular
Khamas, in those particular Khamba-bhaasas, in those particular Khamba-soses, in
those particular Khamba-pudantaras, in those particular Suis, in those
particular Sui-muhas, in those particular Sui-phalas, in those particular Sui-
pudantaras, in those particular Pakkhas, in those particular Pakkha-bhaasas, in
those particular Pakkha-perantaras, there are many, many Uppa-laais, Pau-maais,
even up to a hundred thousand Pattaais, all adorned with Achchaais, Sahaais,
Lanhaais, Dhatthaais, Mattaa-is, Gorayaais, Nimmalaais, Nippankaais,
Nikkankadchchaayaais, Sapphabaais, Samiriyaais, Saujjoyaais, Pasaadiyaais,
Darisanijjaais, Abhiruvaais, Padiruvaais, Maha-maha-Vasikkachchattasamayaais,
and Pannaattaais, O Samanau-so!"  "So, Venerable Sir, that is what is called a
Padmavaravedika."  "Venerable Sir, is it a Sasaya or an Asasaya?"  "Well, it is
a Sasaya, it is an Asasaya."  "So, Venerable Sir, that is what is called a
Sasaya, an Asasaya."  "Well, it is a Sasaya because of the Dabdhattaya; it is an
Asasaya because of the Vanna-pajjavehis, Gandha-pajjavehis, Rasa-pajjavehis, and
Phasa-panjjavehis."  "So, Venerable Sir, that is what is called a Sasaya, an
Asasaya."  "Venerable Sir, how long does the Kalamo last?"  "Well, it has never
been, it is now, and it will never be. It is, it was, and it will be. It is a
Sasaya according to the Dhuva-niyaya, an Akkhaya, an Anvaya, a Pravatiya, a
Niccha Padmavaravediya."  [125] In the exact middle of that world, there is said
to be a vast Padmavaravedika. That Padmavaravedika is half a yojana high and
five hundred dhanus wide. It is made of all jewels. Its circumference is equal
to the circumference of the middle part of the world. This Padmavaravedika is
made of all jewels, it is pure, it is beautiful, it is perfect. The description
of that Padmavaravedika is as follows: its Nems (the parts that rise above the
ground) are made of Vajraratna, its Mula-paayas (the base) are made of
Rishtaratra, its pillars are made of Vaiduryaratna, its Pattis (panels) are made
of gold and silver, its joints are made of Vajra, its Suchias (these Suchias are
like sandals that hold the Pattis together, preventing them from disintegrating)
are made of Lohitakshararatna! The pictures of human beings and other bodies
that are drawn here are made of many kinds of jewels, and the pictures of pairs
of men and women are also made of many kinds of jewels. The pictures that are
drawn in addition to the human pictures are all made of many kinds of jewels.
The pictures of pairs of many beings are also made of various jewels. Its
Pakkha-ajuu-baaju parts (the sides) are made of Ankaratnas. The large, large
Prushta-vanshas are made of a jewel called Jyotiraratna. The bamboo that is
placed on both sides of the large vanshas in a slanting manner to keep them
stable is also made of Jyotiraratna. The long wooden planks that are placed on
top of the bamboo on the roof are made of silver. The Prohadanias (large kimdias
for covering) that are placed on top of the Kambas (pillars) to cover them are
made of gold, and the Punchhanias (small kimdias like soft grass for dense
covering) are made of Vajraratna. The covering above the Punchhani and below the
Kavel is made of white silver.

348]] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra] The Padmavaravedika is adorned with garlands of
gold, hanging from all directions. Some are made of precious stones, some are
shaped like small bells, some are shaped like large bells, some are made of
pearls, some are made of gems, some are made of gold, and some are shaped like
lotus flowers. These garlands are suspended from long, golden canopies,
decorated with gold leaf, and adorned with various necklaces and half-necklaces
of different types of gems. They are spaced close together, swaying gently in
the breeze coming from the east, west, north, and south, vibrating, stretching
out, and clanging together. The sound produced by these garlands is loud, yet
pleasing, charming, and soothing to the ears and minds of the listeners. These
garlands, filled with pleasing sounds, adorn all directions with their beauty.
In different places on the Padmavaravedika, there are carvings of groups of
horses, elephants, men, Kinnaras, Kimpurushas, Mahoragas, Gandharvas, and bulls,
all made of precious stones, pure, and perfect in form. In different places on
the Padmavaravedika, there are rows of horses, rows of bulls, etc., all made of
precious stones, pure, and perfect in form. In different places on the
Padmavaravedika, there are double rows of horses, double rows of bulls, etc.,
all made of precious stones, pure, and perfect in form. In different places on
the Padmavaravedika, there are pairs of horses, pairs of bulls, etc., all made
of precious stones, perfect in form.  On the Padmavaravedika, there are many
lotus vines, naga vines, ashoka vines, champaca vines, chautavana vines, vasanti
vines, atimukta vines, kunda vines, and shyamala vines, all perpetually
blooming, with well-arranged and distinctive flower clusters. These vines are
made of precious stones, smooth, soft, fragrant, sweet, lotus-like, pure,
spotless, flawless, radiant, luminous, bright, pleasing, beautiful, and perfect
in form. (On the Padmavaravedika, there are many auspicious swastikas, all made
of precious stones and pure.)  O Bhagavan! Why is the Padmavaravedika called the
Padmavaravedika?  Gautama! On the Padmavaravedika, in different places, on the
platforms (elevated places for sitting), on the sides of the platforms, between
two platforms, around the pillars, on the tops of the pillars, in the spaces
between two pillars, on the moldings that connect two panels, and on the faces
of the moldings...

Third Pratipatti: On the Vanakhanda-dharma, below and above the signs, in the
intervals between the two signs, in the sides of the vedika, in one region of
the sides, in the intervals of the two sides, there are many utpala (lotus),
padma (sun-evolved lotus), kumuda (moon-evolved lotus), nalina, subhaga,
saugandhika, pundarlka (white lotus), mahapundarlka (large white lotus),
shatapatra, sahasrapatra, and other diverse lotuses. These lotuses are all-
jeweled, clean, and beautiful, and are replicas.  These lotuses are like large
umbrellas (chattris) planted during the rainy season. O venerable ascetic!
Therefore, this padmavara-vedika is called padmavara-vedika. O Lord! Is the
padmavara-vedika eternal or non-eternal? Gautama! It is somewhat eternal and
somewhat non-eternal.   O Lord! Why is it said that the padmavara-vedika is
somewhat eternal and somewhat non-eternal? Gautama! It is eternal in terms of
substance and non-eternal in terms of color-modifications, taste-modifications,
smell-modifications, and touch-modifications. Therefore, O Gautama, it is said
that the padmavara-vedika is somewhat eternal and somewhat non-eternal.  O Lord!
For how long will the padmavara-vedika last? Gautama! It was not that it 'never
was', it is not that 'it never is', and it is not that 'it will never be'. It
was, is, and will always be. It is permanent, fixed, eternal, imperishable,
indestructible, stable, and eternal.  This is the description of the padmavara-
vedika. Vanakhanda-varnana 126 [1] "Then, going further, one sees in that great
forest the padmavara-vedika, which extends for two yojanas, surrounded by the
horizon, with various hues from black to white, up to..."

(1) The vast forest tract described as being beyond the rampart (prākārakalpa)
and outside the lotus-covered dais is said to be more than two yojanas in
circumference, equal to the circumference of the rampart. This forest tract is
dark in color due to its lush greenery and dense shade. The roots of the trees
in this forest have penetrated deep into the earth, and the trees are endowed
with excellent tubers, trunks, bark, branches, tender shoots, leaves, flowers,
fruits, and seeds. The trees are spread out in all directions and quarters,
their branches and sub-branches forming a rounded appearance. They are
beautiful, well-formed, and charming in appearance. Each tree has a single
trunk, and the girth of the trunk is so vast that even many men cannot encompass
it with their outstretched arms.  (2) The leaves of these trees are unperforated
and dense, so closely set that no gaps are visible between them. The leaves do
not fall to the ground due to the wind, and there is no disease affecting the
leaves. The old or whitened leaves that do fall are blown away by the wind and
deposited elsewhere. The dense foliage of the new, lustrous leaves creates a
darkness in the middle portion, making the trees appear beautiful and worth
beholding.  (3) The tree-tops are adorned with continuously emerging tender
shoots and delicate, radiant, and trembling young leaves. These trees are always
in blossom, always in bud, always in leaf, always in cluster, always in bunch,
always in pair, always in bend, and always in obeisance. Thus, these trees, ever
in blossom up to being ever in obeisance, bear the well-distributed, beautiful,
garland-like appearance.  (4) Upon these trees are seated numerous pairs of
parrots, peacocks, cuckoos, kokils, cakravākas, hamsa, and other birds, calling
out from afar.

## Third Chapter: Description of the Forest  [351] The advanced words that are
heard, continue to chirp and chatter, adding to the beauty of these trees. A
community of intoxicated bees and wasps, who gather honey, hover over them.
Intoxicated by the nectar they have collected from other places, the buzzing
bees, engrossed in the consumption of pollen, hum sweetly, filling the trees
with their sound. The flowers and fruits of these trees remain hidden within
them. These trees are covered with leaves and flowers from the outside. These
trees are free from all kinds of diseases, free from thorns. Their fruits are
delicious and have a smooth touch. These trees are adorned with various types of
clusters, shrubs, and vine-covered arbors. Many types of flags flutter on them.
To irrigate these trees, beautiful net-like structures are built in square
wells, round ponds, and long lamps. These trees release such a unique and
pleasant fragrance that one cannot be satisfied with it. The beds of these trees
are auspicious, and the flags on them are also multi-faceted.  Many chariots,
carts, vehicles, Yugya (a type of carriage famous in the Golldesh region),
Shivika, and Syandamanika are left under them (due to the abundance of shade).
That forest is picturesque, joyful, smooth, soft, thick, sweet, watery,
spotless, pure, with unblemished radiance, luminous, radiant, shining, majestic,
beautiful, attractive, and exemplary. Inside that forest is a very even and
beautiful land. That land is as smooth as the stretched leather of a Mruj (a
type of musical instrument), as smooth as the stretched leather of a Mridanga,
as smooth as the bottom of a water-filled lake, as smooth as a palm, as smooth
as a mirror, as smooth as the moon, as smooth as the sun, as smooth as the
leather of an Urbhra (a type of drum), as smooth as the leather of a bull, as
smooth as the skin of a Varaha (pig), as smooth as the skin of a lion, as smooth
as the skin of a tiger, as smooth as the skin of a wolf, and as smooth as the
skin of a cheetah. When the skin of all these animals is stretched with
thousands of nails, it becomes perfectly smooth (hence these similes are used to
describe the smoothness of that land). That forest is adorned with gems, various
types of five-colored gems, flower garlands, lotus petals, ocean waves, spring
vines, lotus vines, and various other pictures, all arranged in a pattern, in a
series, in a row, in a swastika, in a sauvastika, in a Pushyamana, in a
Vardhamana, in a Matsyandaka, in a Makaranda, in a Jarmarala, and with grass.
Those gems are radiant, luminous, shining, and have a black-like, five-colored
appearance. That forest is adorned with such five-colored gems and grass.  The
discussion presented in this sutra describes the forest. This forest, which is
about two yojanas in extent and has a circumference equal to that of the earth,
is dark and appears dark due to its lush greenery and abundance of shade. The
word "Yavat" is given further, from which other adjectives given elsewhere
should be understood as follows:  * Harie Hariobhaase - The forest is green in
some places and appears green. * Nile Niloabhaase - The forest is blue in some
places and appears blue. * Leaves that have not crossed the green stage and
reached the black stage are called blue.  Due to these combinations, the forest
is called blue and bluish.

[352] [The ninth section of the Sutrakritanga, the section on the forest, is
described as cool and cool-appearing. When the leaves have passed childhood,
they become cool. Due to their combination, the forest is also cool and appears
cool. Intense, smooth, and sharp are the terms used to describe the black, blue,
and green colors in their own nature. Due to this combination, the forest is
also described as smooth, smooth-appearing, sharp, and sharp-appearing.
Appearance can also be deceptive, like the mirage in the desert, which is a
deceptive appearance of water. Therefore, to negate the deceptive appearance,
other adjectives have been given, such as black and black-shadowed. The forest
appears black and black-shadowed to everyone equally. This indicates its
inconsistency. Deceptive appearance does not appear the same to everyone. Blue
and blue-shadowed, cool and cool-shadowed. The forest is blue and blue-shadowed.
It is cool and cool-shadowed. Here, the word "shadow" should be understood as
the opposite of sunlight. Dense-shadowed. The trees in this forest have dense
shade in the middle because there are many branches and twigs spread out in the
middle. This makes their shade dense. Delightful. This forest is delightful.
Like a multitude of great rain clouds filled with water. The description of the
trees in the forest is clear from the original text, which is given in
parentheses. The land of that forest is extremely delightful and flat. Various
similes have been given to describe its flatness. The flatness of the land has
been compared to the stretched skin of various animals like a buffalo, a drum, a
lake, a palm, a mirror, the moon, the sun, the skin of a bull, and the skin of a
bull. When the skin of these animals is stretched with the help of nails, it
becomes completely smooth and flat, without any wrinkles. Similarly, the land is
flat, not bumpy, uneven, or high and low. Therefore, it is extremely delightful.
Not only that, but various kinds of paintings are drawn on that flat land. These
paintings include paintings of mountains, valleys, rows, series, swastikas,
auspicious swastikas, prosperous men, growing standards, fish-shaped ornaments,
crocodile-shaped ornaments, and five-colored jewels with the characteristics of
a jar-shaped ornament. Paintings of flower garlands, bird feathers, ocean waves,
spring creepers, lotus creepers, etc., are painted with five-colored jewels and
grass. Those jewels are of five colors, they are lustrous, radiant, and
illuminating. The next section of the sutra describes the five types of jewels
and grass through similes. It is as follows: 126. [2] There, those black grasses
and jewels, they are described as having this color and appearance. They are
like charcoal, collyrium, antimony, lampblack, ink, a kind of red earth, and a
kind of red earth. 1-In some manuscripts, the reading "ink" and "a kind of red
earth" is not present.

Rather, their color is more desirable, lovely, dear, charming, and delightful.
[126] (2) Among those grasses and gems, the ones that are of black color are
described as follows: like a rain-filled cloud at the beginning of the rainy
season, or like the Sauveera-aanjana or aanjana gem, or like the Khanjana (a

or like a cuckoo, or like an elephant, or like an elephant calf, or like a black

Bhagavan! Is the color of those white grasses and gems like this? Gautam! This
is not true. / The color of those grasses and gems is said to be even more
desirable, beautiful, pleasing, and attractive. [126] (7) Bhagavan! What is the
fragrance of those grasses and gems said to be like? Like that of Koष्ट (a type
of fragrant substance) pots, Patra pots, Choya pots (a type of fragrant
substance), Tagar pots, Elaichi pots, Chandan pots, 1. 'Kirimeripudaan wa' is

Jivajivabhigamasutram  The fragrance that emanates and spreads all around when
the Jain ritual substances such as kunkuma (saffron), ushira (vetiver),
champaka, marava, damana, jati (jasmine), juhī (jasmine), mallika (jasmine),
navamallika, vasantilata, kevada, and camphor are opened, split, crushed, broken
into small pieces, scattered, thrown upwards, consumed, or transferred from one
vessel to another, is so extensive, pleasant, and satisfying to the nose and
mind, O Lord! Is that the fragrance of those grasses and gems? Gautama, this is
not true. Even more desirable, charming, beloved, pleasant, and delightful is
the fragrance of those grasses and gems.  The touch of those grasses and gems is
said to be like the soft touch of ajina (a type of cloth), wool, bura (a plant),
makshika (honey), hamsa-garbhalika (a type of flower), sirisa flower cluster,
the mass of petals of a newly bloomed lotus, is it so? No, this is not correct.
The touch of those grasses and gems is even more delightful, charming, beloved,
pleasant, and delightful than that.  The sound that emanates and spreads all
around when those grasses and gems are gently moved by the northern, southern,
eastern, and western winds, causing them to tremble, shake, sway, and collide,
is it like the sound of the sibya (a musical instrument), sandamani (a musical
instrument), the chariot, the well-decorated, bejeweled, garlanded, and
festooned royal umbrella with its melodious jingling, the sound of the golden
palace with its intricate carvings and decorations, or the sound of the
skillfully crafted and ornamented chariot wheel? No, this is not correct. The
sound that emanates from the gentle movement of those grasses and gems by the
winds is even more magnificent, pleasant, and delightful to the ears.

[Third Chapter: Description of the Forest] Those who understand the subtle.
What kind of sound is produced by the vibration of the grass and gems, caused by
the wind coming from the east, west, south, and north, especially when it
vibrates, vibrates repeatedly, is agitated, moved, and pulsates, and when it is
stimulated?  Like a Shibika (a special palanquin with a covered canopy), a
Syandamanika (a large palanquin, the size of a man, with a special jumpan), and
a Sangram Rath (whose platform is the size of a man's waist), which is adorned
with umbrellas, flags, large bells hanging on both sides, a magnificent torana,
Nandighosh (the sound of twelve types of musical instruments), small bells
(ghughrus), adorned with golden garlands all around, made of tinish wood with
beautiful and charming pictures of the Himalayas, inlaid with gold, with well-
fitted axles and a strong axle, with iron bands on the wheels, adorned with
excellent horses, driven by a skilled and expert charioteer, with thirty-two
tunir, each with one hundred arrows, with a helmet as its crown, full of various
weapons like bows, arrows, spears, and their coverings, and decorated for the
battle of warriors, when it moves rapidly in the royal court, or in the inner
palace, or on the floor inlaid with gems, going back and forth, what kind of
generous, pleasing, ear and mind-satisfying sound comes out from all sides, is
that the sound of those grasses and gems?  O Gautam! This meaning is not true.
O Bhagavan! Just as a Vaitalika (a mangalpathica) Veena, which is played even in
the absence of a taal, is adorned with a murcchana called Uttaramanda (under the
Gandhar swara), is placed properly in the lap of the player, is rubbed with a
cone (vadan danda) made of sandalwood, is held by a skilled male or female
player, and when it is vibrated gently and especially, played, agitated, moved,
pulsated, rubbed, and stimulated in the morning and evening, what kind of
generous, pleasing, ear and mind-satisfying sound comes out from all sides, is
that the sound of those grasses and gems?

Himalayas, Malaya Mountains or Mount Meru, who are gathered in one place, who

listeners, songs with beautiful bends of the limbs, songs of the best beauty,
what is the sound that comes out of the mouths of those Kinnaras etc. who sing
such divine songs? Yes Gautam! The sound produced by the vibration of those
grasses and gems is of this kind. Discussion - In that forest area, the sound
that comes out when the grasses and gems are vibrated and driven by the wind is
described in this sutra section. Shri Gautam Swami has mentioned three similes
for that level. The first simile is - a palanquin (shibika or jumpan) or a war
chariot adorned with various types of weapons, whose wheels are studded with
iron plates, which is equipped with excellent horses and a charioteer, which is
equipped with an umbrella and a flag, which is equipped with large bells on both
sides, in which there is a Nandighosh (the sound of twelve types of instruments)
- such a chariot or palanquin when it moves rapidly in the royal court, in the
inner apartments or in the courtyard studded with gems, what is the sound like
that of those grasses and gems? The Lord said - No / It is even more desirable,
radiant, dear, pleasing and beautiful that sound / After this, Shri Gautam Swami
mentioned the second simile / It is as follows - O Bhagavan! In the morning or
in the evening, the Vaitalika (Mangalpathika) Veena (which is played even
without rhythm - when it is equipped with the seventh murcchana called
Uttarmanda of the Gandharva note, when the skilled player of that Veena
establishes that Veena well in his lap and plays it with a playing stick made of
sandalwood essence, then the sound that comes out of that Veena, which satisfies
the ears and mind, is that the sound of those grasses and gems? There are seven
murcchana of the Gandharva note - Nandi, Y, Khutti, Ma, Puri, Ya or the fourth
Asuddhgandhara. Uttar Gandhara is the fifth murcchana // 1 //

## The Description of the Forest Section:  **(359) The six rules of the
Suhmuत्तर are to be understood.**  **(2)**  There are seven Mūrcchanās: Nandī,
Kṣudra, Pūrṇā, Śuddhagāndhārā, Uttaragāndhārā, Sūkṣmōttara-āyāma, and
Uttaramandā. These Mūrcchanās are significant because they make the singer and
the listener feel as if they are in a trance, distinct from other sounds. As it
is said, "The Mūrcchanā is said to be a means of making the sound distinct from
other sounds. The throat also makes a sound like a trance."  When the
Uttaramandā Mūrcchanā, which is within the Gāndhāra svar, reaches its peak, it
makes the listeners feel as if they are in a trance. Not only that, but the
singer, while performing the specific sounds, also becomes like someone in a
trance.  **Is the sound of the Vīnā, which is imbued with the Uttaramandā
Mūrcchanā, like the sound of those blades of grass and gems?**  Upon being asked
by Śrī Gautama, the Lord says, "No, the sound of those blades of grass and gems
is even more pleasing, attractive, dear, delightful, and charming than this
sound."  **Again, Śrī Gautama gives a third comparison:**  "O Lord! Is the sound
of the Kinnaras, Kimpuruṣas, Mahoragas, or Gandharvas, who reside in the
Bhadraśāla forest, Nandana forest, Somanaś forest, Paṇḍaka forest, or who are
seated in the caves of the Himāvan mountain, Malaya mountain, or Mandara
mountain, who are gathered in one place, sitting facing each other, seated in
such a way that they are not hindered by the rubbing of another, and are not
hindered by their own limbs, with joy playing on their bodies, who are engaged
in play with delight, who have a fondness for song, whose minds are delighted by
drama, etc., is the sound of their singing, which is composed of eight types of
songs and is accompanied by the qualities of songs mentioned later, free from
defects, and imbued with rhythm and beat, like the sound of those blades of
grass and gems?"  **There are eight types of songs:**  1. **Gady**: sung with
the flow of sounds. 2. **Pady**: in the form of Chanda, etc. 3. **Kathy**: songs
with a narrative. 4. **Padabaddha**: in the form of one letter, etc., like "Te".
5. **Pādabaddha**: in the form of the fourth part of a verse. 6. **Utkṣipta**:
which is begun first. 7. **Pravartaka**: which is begun from the beginning and
is accompanied by an exclamation. 8. **Mandaka**: which is in the middle part,
with all the qualities of Mūrcchanā, etc., and is sung with a slow and gentle
sound.  **This eight-fold song should have a pleasing ending, i.e., the song
should end gradually in a pleasing manner, and should be composed of seven
notes.**  **The seven notes of the song are as follows:**  **Saje Risaha
Gandhāre Majjhime Pancame Sare** **Dhevae Ceva Nesāe Sara Satta Viyāhiyā**
**Saḍja, Ṛṣabha, Gāndhāra, Madhyama, Pañcama, Dhaivat, and Naiṣāda, these are
the seven notes.**  **These seven notes emerge from the navel region of a man or
a woman, as it is said, "Saptasara Nābiyo".**  **Aṣṭaras-Samprāyakta**: This
song should be imbued with sentiments like Śṛngāra, etc., and with the essence
of the text.  **Ṣaḍdoṣa-Viprāyukta**: This song should be free from six defects.
**These six defects are as follows:**  **Bhiyam Duyama Uppiṭṭham Uttālam Ca
Kamaso Muṇeyavvam** **Kāgasaramāṇuṇāsaṁ Chhaddoṣā Hoti Geyassa**  **These are
the six defects of the song.**

## 360] Within the Jeevajeevaabhigamsutra, there are six defects of singing:
Druta, Uppicch (agitated), Uttala, Kakaswara, and Anunas (singing through the
nose).  The eleven qualities of singing are described in detail in the
Swaraprabhrut section of the Ekadashagunalankaar Purva.  Currently, the Purva is
incomplete, therefore, one should learn about these qualities from the remaining
parts of the Purva, such as the Bharata, Vishakhila, and other singing
scriptures.  The eight qualities of singing with the eight qualities are as
follows:  Punnam, Rattam, Alankiyam, Vattam, Taheva Avighoot, Mahuram, Samam,
Sullaliyam.    1. **Punnam:**  A song that is complete and full of musical
notes. 2. **Rattam:**  A song that is sung with passion and attachment to the
raga. 3. **Alankiyam:**  A song that is adorned with unique and special musical
notes. 4. **Vattam:**  A song where the lyrics and notes are clearly pronounced.
5. **Avighoot:**  A song that is free from dissonance and harshness. 6.
**Mahuram:**  A song that is sung with a sweet and melodious voice. 7.
**Samam:**  A song that is in harmony with the rhythm, tempo, and notes. 8.
**Sullaliyam:**  A song that is pleasing to the ears and sung with a beautiful
and refined style.  These are the qualities of a good song.  A song that is sung
with three melodious sounds on the flute is called **Gujjanta Vansakuharam**.  A
song that is sung with passion and attachment to the raga is called **Rattam**.
A song that is sung with purity from the chest, throat, and head is called
**Tristhanakaranashuddha**.  This means that the chest and throat are free from
phlegm, and the head is calm and composed.  A song that is sung in harmony with
the flute and the stringed instruments is called **Sakuhara Gujjanta
Vansatantoususampoutta**.  A song that is sung in harmony with the hand claps is
called **Talsusamprayukta**.  A song that is sung in harmony with the rhythm,
tempo, and notes of the stringed instruments is called **Talsamam
Layasamprayukta Grahasusamprayukta**.  A song that is captivating and enchanting
is called **Manoharam**.  A song that is sung with a soft voice and incorporates
the notes of the stringed instruments is called **Maduribhitapadasanchaar**.  A
song that brings joy and delight to the listeners is called **Suraee**.  A song
that is sung with beautiful and graceful gestures is called **Sunati**.  A song
that has a unique and beautiful form is called **Varchaaruroopam**.  When the
Kinnaras, Kimpurushas, Mahoragas, and Gandharvas sing a song with these
qualities, they are filled with joy and delight.  The sound that comes out of
their mouths is so beautiful, it is like the sound of the finest jewels and
grasses.  Sri Gautam Swami asked, "Is the sound of these jewels and grasses
really so beautiful?"  The Lord replied, "Yes, Gautam! The sound of these jewels
and grasses is truly beautiful."

[Description of the ponds, etc., in the forest] [The explanation of the forests
like Bhadrashala, etc., found in Sutra 361 is as follows. The four forests,
Bhadrashala, etc., are on Mount Sumeru. Of these, the Bhadrashala forest is on
the lower part of Mount Meru, the Nandana forest is on the first belt of Meru,
the Saumanasa forest is on the second belt, and the Pandaka forest is all around
the Chulika. The Mahahimavan is in the north of the Himavat region. It is called
the Varshadhara mountain because it is its boundary. Description of the ponds,
etc., in the forest] [127. (1) In that forest, in that place, in that place,
there are many small ponds, round or lotus-shaped pushkarinis, canals with
ditches, winding canals, lakes, rows of lakes, many rows of canals (where well
water is brought by canals) and many rows of wells. They are clean, made of soft
earth. Their banks are even, their edges are made of silver, the stones on the
edge are vajra-like. Their bottom is made of tapaniya (gold). Their surrounding
elevated areas are made of vaiduryamani and crystal. Their soft bottoms are like
butter. They have golden and pure silver sand. They are all pleasant to enter
and exit. Their ghats are strong, made of various kinds of gems. The wells and
ponds are square. Their water-holding capacity is gradually deeper and deeper,
and their water is deep and cool. The lotus leaves, tubers, and lotus stalks in
them are covered with water. There are many utpala, kumuda, nalina, subhaga,
fragrant, pundarika, satapatra, sahasrapatra flowers in bloom, and they are full
of pollen. All these lotuses are surrounded by bees, i.e., the bees keep
drinking their nectar. All these reservoirs are full of clean and pure water.
Many fish and tortoises roam around, many birds 1. According to the usage, the
meaning of 'suj' is special silver. 2. 'Parihatya' means many.

[Third Chapter: Description of the groves and courtyards of the Banakhanda] [365
In those praaligharas (palaces) and aadarshdharas (ideal places), there are many
hansasan (swan-shaped seats) and dishaswastikasan (seats with auspicious symbols
in four directions), which are made of all precious gems and are beautiful. / In
those places and parts of that Banakhanda, there are many jaai (mandapas (bower)
adorned with jasmine flowers), juhi mandapas, mallika mandapas, navamalika
mandapas, vasantillata mandapas, dadhivasuka mandapas, surilli mandapas,
tambulinaagavalli mandapas, mudrika-draksha mandapas, nagalatta mandapas, prati
muktaka mandapas, mandapas of special apfoya plants, maluka mandapas (trees with
single-seeded fruits) and shyamalata mandapas. These are always in bloom,
budding, and sprouting, and they are all made of precious gems, clean, and
beautiful. / In those jaai mandapas and shyamalata mandapas, there are many
earth-stone slabs, some of which are like hansasan (swan-shaped), some are like
kraunchasan (crane-shaped), some are like garudasana (garuda-shaped), some are
like unnatasana (elevated seat), some are like pranatasana (prostrate seat),
some are like bhadrasana (auspicious seat), some are like dirghasana (long
seat), some are like pakshyasana (bird-shaped seat), some are like makarasana
(crocodile-shaped seat), vrishabhasana (bull-shaped seat), simhasana (lion-
shaped seat), padmasana (lotus-shaped seat), and some are like disha-
swastikasana (seats with auspicious symbols in four directions). O Ayushman
Shraman! There are many earth-stone slabs there, which are similar in nature to
the specific marks and names, and the main sleeping and sitting places. Their
touch is as soft as ajinak (deer skin), cotton, bur plant, butter, and hansatull
(swan down), and they are soft. / They are all made of precious gems, clean, and
beautiful. There are many vanavyantara devas (celestial beings of the forest)
and devis (goddesses) who rest comfortably, lie down, stand, sit, turn over,
enjoy, behave as they wish, play, and engage in amorous play. / In this way,
those vanavyantara devis and devas experience the fruits of their good and
beneficial actions, the results of their religious practices, austerities, and
other auspicious deeds performed in their previous lives. 126. (5) In that
jagati (world) above and inside the padmavaravedika (lotus-shaped platform),
there is a large forest called Banakhanda, which is slightly less than two
yojanas in extent, with a circumference equal to the perimeter of the vedika. /
It is of the color of the sky, devoid of the sound of grass and humans, and is
pleasant. / There, many vanavyantara devas and devis live, dwell, stand, sit,
turn over, enjoy, play, and are delighted. They experience the special fruits of
their good and beneficial actions, the results of their good and auspicious
deeds performed in their previous lives. / 1. The reading 'samalayamandava' is
not found in some places. 2. The reading 'mansalsugutuvisitthasanthanasanthiya'
is also found in some places. Those stone slabs are fleshy - not hard, very
smooth, and of a special nature. 1

be "Jiwa Jiwa Abhigamsutra Kali Kanti wala hai" etc., should be mentioned here.
Only the description of the words "trinan" and "mani" should not be mentioned
here (because here, due to the obstruction of the Padmavar Vedika and the
absence of wind, there is no sound). Here, many Vanvyantar Devis and Devas are
present, lying down, standing, sitting, turning over, romancing, performing
actions as desired, playing, engaging in romantic play, and experiencing the
beneficial results of their past good religious practices, their well-performed
austerities, etc., and their good merits, the beneficial results of their good
deeds. The description of the forest section outside the Padmavar Vedika was

Vrishabha, Ghoda, Manushya, Magar, Pakshi, Sarpa, Kinnara, Ruru (deer), Sarabha
(octopus), Chamar, Hathi, Vanalata, and Padmalata. It is very attractive due to
the presence of Vajravedikamas on its pillars. This gate is so radiant that it
appears to be illuminated not by natural light but by the power of the
Vidyaadharas, who are holders of special knowledge and are paired together. This
gate is adorned with thousands of ornaments. It is radiant, exceptionally
radiant, and the eyes of those who see it are fixed upon it. Touching this gate
is very auspicious and brings happiness. Its form is very beautiful. This gate
is joyful, worth seeing, beautiful, and very charming. The special description
of that gate is as follows: Its foundation is made of Vajra, its pillars are
made of Rishtaratna, its columns are made of Vaiduryaratna, its floor is made of
gold and adorned with five types of precious stones and gems. Its threshold is
made of the Hansagarbha gem, its Indra-keel is made of the Gomayaka gem, and its
door-branches are made of Lohitaksha gems. Its Uttaranga (horizontal beam above
the door) is made of Jyotir-as gem, its doors are made of Vaiduryamani, the
nails joining the two panels are made of Lohitaksha-rasna, its joints are made
of Vajra, its Sutikagruh (birth chamber) is made of various gems, its Argala
(door bolt) is made of Vajra gems, its Pavartan-pithika (where the Indra-keel is

Both its doors are seamless and dense. On both sides of the gate, there are 168
Bhittigullika (wall niches) and 168 Gomanasi (beds). On this gate are paintings
of Vyala-sarya made of various gems, and there are also various gem-made
figurines playing. The top part of this gate is made of Vajra gem, and the peak
of that top part is made of silver. The part of the gate below the roof is made
of Tapaneya gold. The windows of this gate are made of gem-bamboo, Lohitaksha-
bamboo, and silver-ground. Its sides and outer sides are made of Ankaratna. It
has Jyotir-as gem bamboo and bamboo-chavel (roof), silver plates, Jatarup gold
Ohaadani (sparse covering), Vajra gem upper Punchani (dense covering), and all-

The English translation preserving the Jain terms is as follows:  The
Jivajivabhigama Sutra says that the Vijayadvara (the victorious gateway) has a
silver canopy. It is profusely decorated with gem-studded, golden spires and a
golden stupa (small pinnacle). The whiteness of that gateway is like conch
shells, pure and solidified curd, cow's milk, foam, and a multitude of silver.
It is adorned with tilaka gems and half-moons, and decorated with garlands of
precious stones. It is made of soft and delicate pudgala (material) aggregates
both inside and outside, with layers of golden sand. This Vijayadvara is
pleasant to touch, auspicious, beautiful in form, palatial, worth seeing,
charming, and exemplary.  On both sides of the Vijayadvara, there are two
nisedhikas (seating places) described. In those two nisedhikas, there are rows
of two chandana (sandalwood) kalasas (pots/vases). Those chandana kalasas are
placed on excellent lotus flowers, filled with fragrant and superior water,
smeared with chandana, having garlands of flowers around their necks, and
covered with lotus petals. They are made of all kinds of jewels, are clean and
smooth, and are extremely beautiful, like great Mahendra-kumbhas (large pots).
On both sides of the Vijayadvara, there are also two rows of nagadantas
(elephant tusks). Those nagadantas are surrounded by pearl nets, golden
garlands, and lattices of gavaaksha (windows). Many of those nagadantas have
garlands of black threads and white threads tied around them.  Those garlands
are hanging down, decorated with golden plates, and shining with various
ornaments and decorations, extremely pleasing and delightful to see.  On the
chests of those nagadantas, there are two more rows of nagadantas described,
which are also surrounded by pearl nets and other similar decorations.  Among
those nagadantas, many are made of reddish-yellow (rajata) gems. And among those
reddish-yellow gems, many dhupa-ghadis (incense burners) made of vaidurya
(beryl) gems are described. Those dhupa-ghadis emit the fragrance of excellent
agaru (agarwood), turukka (frankincense), and other fragrant substances, which
completely fill the nostrils of people with their excellent scent.

The Tṛtīya Pratipatti describes the doors of Jambūdvīpa as follows:  [The doors]
are adorned with 369 ratnamālās (garlands of jewels) and small ghantikās
(bells), and are raised to a certain height in the front portion. The upper part
is projecting forward and well-hammered, their form is like the lower half of a
serpent, i.e., extremely simple and elongated, and therefore possessing the
nature of the lower part of a serpent. They are entirely made of vajrarātna
(diamond-like jewel), are clear, soft, and exactly similar.  O venerable
ascetic! Those nāgadantakas (elephant tusks) are said to be like great gajadanta
(elephant tusks). On those nāgadantakas, many flower garlands strung on black
cords are hanging, many flower garlands strung on blue cords are hanging, and
likewise, flower garlands strung on white cords are hanging. In those garlands,
there are golden pendants, and they are adorned with golden tassels. The
assemblage of those garlands is beautifully decorated with various kinds of gem-
jewels and half-garlands, and they are extremely, extremely resplendent with
magnificence.  Above those nāgadantakas, there are rows of other nāgadantakas as
well. Those nāgadantakas are hung with golden garlands in the midst of pearl
nets, and with ratnamālās (garlands of jewels) in the shape of windows, and
small ghantikās (bells). O venerable ascetic! Those nāgadantakas are said to be
like great gajadanta (elephant tusks). Among those nāgadantakas, there are said
to be many rājatamaya (silver-like) chīnkas (pendants).  In those rājatamaya
chīnkas, there are dhūpaghaṭikās (incense burners) made of vaiḍūrya-ratna (lapis
lazuli). Those dhūpaghaṭikās are delightful with the pervasive fragrance of
burning black agaru, excellent pine, and frankincense, emitting a fragrance like
that of pleasant substances, appearing like fragrance pellets. They are
extremely resplendent, pervading the surrounding regions with their generous,
delightful, and nose and mind-satisfying fragrance.

those bells is as follows - they are made of gold, their pendants are of diamond
gems, the sides of the bells are made of various gems, their chains are of

as the voice of a Krauncha bird, it is Nandisvara like the sound of a dundubhi,
it is Nandighosha like the sound of twelve types of musical instruments, it is
Simhasvara like the roar of a lion, and it is Manjusvara due to its extremely
pleasant sound, and thus it is Manjughosha. The sound and resonance of these
bells are extremely beautiful. These bells, with their generous, pleasant and
ear and mind-pleasing sounds, pervade the surrounding regions with their
extremely distinguished splendor.  On both sides of that Vijayadvara, there are
rows of two Vananalas. These Vananalas are adorned with tender, soft leaves and
blossoms of various creepers and vines, and are beautified by buzzing bees on
the lotuses. These Vananalas are majestic, visually appealing, beautiful and
charming, and, with their generous, pleasant and nose and mind-pleasing
fragrance, they are extremely splendid in the surrounding regions.  The width of
those Panktis (rows) is four yojanas, and the depth is two yojanas. They are all
equally beautiful. On each of those Panktis, there are described Prasadadrisha
(pavilions) at regular intervals. Those Prasadadrisha are four yojanas high, two
yojanas wide, and are adorned with various gem-studded pinnacles, victory
banners, parasols, and their peaks seem to touch the sky. They are bejeweled
with various gems and are beautiful inside and out, with pleasant fragrance and
touch, and are visually appealing, beautiful and charming.  The floors of those
Prasadadrisha are described as being adorned with various gem-studded lotus
ponds, as if embracing the ground.

## Third Chapter: The Number of Gates of Jambudvipa  [373] The upper parts of
these Prasada-avatanskas are adorned with paintings of Padma-lata, Asoka-lata,
and Shyamala-lata, and they are made of pure gold. They are clean, smooth, and
perfect. These Prasada-avatanskas have very even and beautiful land areas. This
land area is as smooth as the skin stretched over a Mridanga drum, and it is
adorned with jewels. Here, the fragrance, color, and touch of the jewels should
be described as before. In the very center of these perfectly smooth and
beautiful land areas, there are said to be various Mani-pithikas. These Mani-
pithikas are one Yojana long and wide, and half a Yojana thick. They are made of
all jewels and are perfect. Above these Mani-pithikas, there are said to be
various Simhasanas. The description of these Simhasanas is as follows: The lions
of these Simhasanas are made of silver, their legs are made of gold, the lower
part of their legs is made of refined gold, the upper part of their legs is made
of various jewels, their bodies are made of Jambunada gold, their joints are
made of ivory, and their middle part is woven with various jewels. These
Simhasanas are adorned with designs of Eha-mriga, Vrishabha, Padma-lata, etc.,
and their footrests are decorated with various precious jewels. On these
Simhasanas, there are cushions with soft touch, filled with fresh, soft Darbha-
agra (Kusa grass) and very soft saffron, which makes them look beautiful. On
these cushions, there is a sheet of cotton cloth with bells, and on top of that,
a Rajastraana is placed to prevent it from getting dirty. They are covered with
beautiful La, they are beautiful, and they have a soft touch like Mriga-charma
(deer skin), cotton, wool, butter, and Arkatul. These Simhasanas are Prasadiya,
Darsaniya, Abhirūpa, and Pratirūpa. Above these Simhasanas, there are said to be
various Vijayasyas (special garments). These Vijayasyas are white, like the
conch shell, Kunda (Jasmine flower), water drop, and the foam that arises from
churning the water of the Kshirodadhi (ocean of milk). They are made of all
jewels, they are clean, and they are perfect. In the very center of these
Vijayasyas, there are said to be various Vajramaya Ankusas (hook-like). These
Vajramaya Ankusas have strings of pearls of Kumhika (a specific measure known in
Magadha) measure hanging from them. These Kumhika-measure Mukta-malas (pearl
garlands) are surrounded on all sides by garlands of four pearls each, of Ardha-
kumhika measure, which are half the height of the former. These Mukta-malas have
Lambusakas (pendants) of refined gold, and they are adorned with golden
Pratarkas (ornaments) all around, and they are extremely beautiful with Sri
(splendor). Above these Prasada-avatanskas, there are said to be various
Mangalas (auspicious symbols), such as Swastika, etc., and Chatras (umbrellas).
131. (1) On both sides of the gate of Vijayassa, there are two Toranas
(archways) each, which are made of various jewels, as well as Chatras
(umbrellas) with eight auspicious symbols. These Toranas have two men each. 1.
The commentary has the reading 'Astajoyananbahallenam' 'Astajoyanan bahalyena'.
2. 'Veccham' means 'arranged' or 'decorated'. The Chunikrit says 'Vecche
Vanakkatena'.

[1131] (1) Two toranas are mentioned on either side of the Vijayadwar, in both
the Naishadhikaas. These toranas are made of various gems, etc. The description
should be known as before, until there are eight-chapter auspicious substances
and umbrellas above umbrellas on them. Two Shalabhanjikas (leaves) are mentioned
in front of those toranas. As the description of those Shalabhanjikas has been
done earlier, it should be said here in the same way / There are two Nagadantaka
(posts) in front of those toranas / Those Nagadantaka are adorned with garlands
hanging inside the Muktajala, etc. The description should be known as before.
There are many communities of wide garlands woven in black thread in those
Nagadantaka, until they are very beautiful. Two pairs of horses (Sanghataka) are
mentioned in front of those toranas, which are made of all gems, pure, until
they are prototypes. Similarly, there are rows of horses (in one direction) and
paths of horses (rows on either side) and pairs of horses (male-female). Two
Padmalatas are depicted in front of those toranas, until they are prototypes.
Akshat Swastikas are depicted in front of those toranas, which are made of all
gems, pure, until they are prototypes / 1. 'Vairame Thale' is also a reading in
some places / There are Vajral Thals.

## Third Chapter: The Number of Gates of Jambudvipa  [375] Two sandalwood pots
are said to be in front of those toranas. Those sandalwood pots are established
on excellent lotuses, etc. You should know the description as before, O
venerable Shraman! They are all made of jewels, as they are prototypes.  Two
Bhingaraks (Jharis) are said to be in front of those toranas. Those Bhingaraks
are established on excellent lotuses, etc. They are all made of jewels, clean,
as they are prototypes. And O venerable Shraman! Those Bhingaraks are large and
have the nature of the mouth of a maddened elephant.  Two Pradarshaks (mirrors)
are said to be in front of those toranas. The description of those Pradarshaks
is as follows: The Prakanthaks (back part) of these mirrors are made of refined
gold, their Stambhas (the place where the mirror is held in the hand) are of
Vaidurya gems, their Varangs (cheek-like frames) are of Vajra gems, their
Valakshas (hanging chains) are of various gems, their Mandals (where the
reflection falls) are of Anka gems.  These mirrors are Anvarshit (naturally
clean without being polished) and have a clear shadow-lustre, they are round
like the moon. O venerable Shraman! These mirrors are said to be large and of
the size of half the body of the viewer.  Two Vajranabha Stalas are said to be
in front of those toranas. Those Stalas appear to be clean, thrice cleansed with
a broom, etc., and filled with pure, crystal-like rice grains that have been
broken by a pestle, etc.  They are all made of gold, clean, as they are
prototypes. O venerable Shraman! Those Stalas are said to be large, like the
wheel of a chariot.  Two Patris are said to be in front of those toranas. These
Patris are filled with clean water. They appear to be filled with various kinds
of green fruits of five colors (the water and fruits are not real, but only
appear so). They are eternal, in the form of earth-transformation. Only a simile
has been given.  Those Stalas are all made of jewels, as they are prototypes,
and are said to be large, like a Gokalinger (bamboo basket or) wheel.  131. (2)
Two Supatitthagas are established in front of those toranas. Those Supatitthagas
are made of Ganavih (five colors) Pasahanagabhandavirachiya Samvosahhipaddipuna,
all made of jewels, clean, as they are prototypes.  Two Manoguliyaos are
established in front of those toranas. In those Manoguliyaos, many fruits made
of gold and silver are established.  In those fruits made of gold and silver,
many Nagadanta made of Bairam, with pearl nets woven between them, are
established, like gold and ivory.  In those Nagadanta made of Bairam, many
Sikkas made of Rayya are established.  In those Sikkas made of Rayya, many
Vayakaragas are established.  Those Vayakaragas are all made of Veruliya, like
black-thread Sikkas, like white-thread Sikkas, clean, as they are prototypes.
Two Chitta Rayan Karandagas are established in front of those toranas. Those
Rayan Karandagas are like a battlefield, with a Chitta in the middle. The Chitta
Rayan Karandagas are decorated with Veruliya gem garlands, with a layer of
Paddalpacchoyde, with a measure of Sae, and with all kinds of things all around.
1. In the Vritti, it is said 'Vajranabha Stala'. In other places, the reading is
'Vairame Thale'.

## Third Chapter: The Number of Gates of Jambudvipa  [377] Two
**ratnakarandaka** (jewel-boxes) are said to be in front of each of those
**torana** (arches). For example, just as a **chaturanta** (four-directional)
**chakravarti** (universal monarch) is made of various jewels and has various
colors, or a wondrous **ratnakarandaka** with a lid made of **vaidurya** (lapis
lazuli) and **sphatika** (crystal) jewels, illuminates the region all around
with its brilliance, these **ratnakarandaka** are similarly adorned with lids of
**vaidurya** and illuminate the region all around with their brilliance.  Two
**hayakanthaka** (a type of jewel) and two **vrishabhakanthaka** (another type
of jewel) are said to be in front of each of those **torana**. They are all made
of jewels, pure and perfect. Two **phula-changeri** (flower-garlands) are said
to be in each **hayakanthaka** and **vrishabhakanthaka**. Similarly, two
**changeri** of **malya** (garlands), **gandha** (perfume), **churna** (powder),
**vastra** (cloth), and **prabharana** (ornaments) are said to be there.
Similarly, two **siddhārtha** (mustard) and **lomahastaka** (peacock feather)
**changeri** are also present. All of these are made of jewels, pure and
perfect.  Two **pushpa-patala** (flower-panels) and two **lomahast-patala**
(peacock feather-panels) are said to be in front of each of those **torana**,
which are all made of jewels and perfect. Two **simhasana** (thrones) are said
to be in front of each of those **torana**. The description of those
**simhasana** is as follows:  Initially, **chhatra** (umbrellas) with silver
coverings are said to be in front of those **torana**. The shafts of those
**chhatra** are made of **vaidurya** jewels, bright and pure. Their **kanika**
(where the threads are strung) is made of gold, their joints are filled with
**vajra** (diamond) jewels, and they are adorned with garlands of pearls. They
have one thousand **path-shalaka** (threads) made of the finest gold. They have
a cool shade that smells like sandalwood, fragrant like perfume, and fragrant in
all seasons. Various auspicious images are painted on those **chhatra**, and
they are round like the moon.  Two **chamara** (fly whisks) are said to be in
front of each of those **torana**. Those **chamara** have shafts adorned with
various jewels like **chandrakant** (moonstone), **vajra** (diamond),
**vaidurya** (lapis lazuli), etc. (Their shafts are adorned with various jewels,
gold, and gems, pure, bright like the most valuable gold, and painted). Those
**chamara** are white like conch shells, **ankaratna** (a type of gem),
**kunda** (jasmine flower), **dagaraj** (water droplets), and the churned foam
of **amrita** (nectar), with fine and long silver hairs. They are all made of
jewels, pure and perfect.  Two **taila-samudgaka** (a type of base), **kostha-
samudgaka**, **patra-samudgaka**, **choya-samudgaka**, **tagra-samudgaka**,
**ilaichi-samudgaka**, **haritala-samudgaka**, **hingulu-samudgaka**,
**manashila-samudgaka**, and **anjana-samudgaka** are said to be in front of
each of those **torana**. (All of these are fragrant substances. The base on
which they are kept is called **samudgaka**.) All of these **samudgaka** are
made of jewels, pure and perfect.  1. "**Hayakantho hayakanthapramanau

380 [Jivajivaabhigamsutra 134. Why, O Venerable One, is it called Vijayadvara?
"O Gotama! In Vijayadvara, there resides a deva named Vijay, who is a Mahiddhio,
a Mahjju, and has a great influence, and is in a state of Paligrovamali.  He is
the lord of four thousand Samanik devas, four Agrmhisis with their families,
three Parsadas, seven Anikas, seven Anikahipatis, and sixteen thousand
Atmarakshaka devas.  He is the lord of Vijayadvara, the capital of Vijay, and of
many other capitals of Vijay.  He enjoys divine pleasures and delights.
Therefore, O Gotama! it is called Vijayadvara.  O Gotama! The name Vijayadvara
is eternal.  It was not in the past, it is not in the present, and it will not
be in the future, as long as it exists and is eternal.  [134]  135. (1) Where, O
Venerable One, is the capital of Vijay, the deva of Vijay, situated?  "O Gotama!
The capital of Vijay is situated in the Jambudvipa, in the eastern direction, in
the ocean of the Tiryanch, twelve yojanas deep.  The capital of Vijay is
situated there, twelve yojanas in length and breadth, and seventy-seven yojanas
in circumference, with a little more than nine hundred yojanas.  It is
surrounded on all sides by a single wall.  This wall is seventy-seven yojanas in
length, half a yojana in height, half thirteen yojanas in width at the base, one
yojana in width in the middle, and three yojanas in width at the top.  It is
wide at the base, narrow in the middle, and thin at the top.  It is round on the
outside and square on the inside, with a Gopuccha-shaped structure, and is
decorated with all kinds of gems.  It is adorned with twenty-two gardens, such
as the Kinna garden, the Sushikala garden, etc.  These twenty-two gardens are
half a yojana in length, five hundred dhanus in width, and half a yojana in
height.  They are made of precious stones and are very beautiful.  1.

[381 [135] (1) O Bhagavan! Where is the capital city of Vijayadev, called
Vijaya, located? Gautama! After crossing countless islands and seas diagonally
east of Vijayadwar, in another island called 'Jambudvipa', after traveling
twelve thousand yojanas, lies the capital city of Vijayadev, Vijaya, which is
twelve thousand yojanas long and wide, and its circumference is slightly more
than one hundred and nine thousand nine hundred and forty-eight yojanas. The
city of Vijaya is surrounded on all sides by a rampart (fortification). The
rampart is thirty-seven and a half yojanas high, its diameter (width) is twelve
and a half yojanas at the base, six yojanas and one kos in the middle, and three
yojanas and half a kos at the top; thus it is wide at the base, narrow in the
middle, and thin at the top. It is round on the outside and square on the
inside, shaped like a cow's tail. It is entirely made of gold, clean and
perfect. The rampart is adorned with various types of five-year-old
Kapishirshakas (gargoyles), such as black and white gargoyles. These gargoyles
are half a kos in length, five hundred dhanus in width, and slightly less than
half a kos in height. These gargoyles are entirely made of gems, clean and
perfect. 135. (2) In the capital city of Vijaya, there are twenty-five hundred
gates on each side, according to the scriptures. These gates are thirty-three
yojanas and one kos high, thirty-three yojanas and one kos wide, and the same
length in depth. They are made of white metal, clean and perfect. They are
adorned with various types of five-year-old Kapishirshakas (gargoyles), such as
black and white gargoyles. These gargoyles are half a kos in length, five
hundred dhanus in width, and slightly less than half a kos in height. These

[34] Four forest sections are said to be located at a distance of five hundred
yojanas in each direction from the capital city of Vijaya, namely: 1. Ashoka
forest, 2. Saptaparna forest, 3. Champaka forest, and 4. Amra forest. / The
Ashoka forest is in the east, the Saptaparna forest is in the south, the
Champaka forest is in the west, and the Amra forest is in the north. These
forest sections are slightly more than twelve thousand yojanas long and five
hundred yojanas wide. Each of them is surrounded by a rampart, is black, and
appears black. - This description of the forest sections should be understood
until there are many celestial beings and goddesses residing there, sleeping
(because there is no sleep in the celestial realm), staying, sitting, turning
over, enjoying, playing, sporting, engaging in amorous play, and experiencing
the beneficial results of their past good practices, their well-cultivated
austerities, and their good deeds. / In the very middle of these forest
sections, there are said to be separate praasadaavatasakas. These
praasadaavatasakas are sixty-two and a half yojanas high, thirty-one yojanas and
one kos long and wide. These praasadaavatasakas appear to be bound by a radiance
emanating from all sides, or they appear to be smiling with a white radiance.
This description should be understood until there is a very level and pleasant
land inside them, and various paintings of lotus vines, etc., are drawn on the
inner ceilings. / In the very middle of these praasadaavatasakas, there are said
to be separate thrones. Their description should be understood as before, until
the thrones with their families are understood. / Above these
praasadaavatasakas, there are many eight-part auspicious objects, flags, and
umbrellas on umbrellas. There reside four celestial beings who are of great
merit and who are in the state of palyopama. Their names are: 1. Ashoka, 2.
Saptaparna, 3. Champaka, and 4. Amra. They rule over their respective forest
sections, their respective praasadaavatasakas, their respective samanika
celestial beings, their respective chief queens, their respective councils, and
their respective protector celestial beings, and they continue to roam. 136. (2)
In the capital city of Vijaya, there is a very pleasant land in the middle,
which is adorned with five kinds of jewels and is free from the sound of grass,

## Translation:  [396] The _jiva_ souls, bound by their past karmas, wander
about, rising and sitting. In the midst of that multi-splendid land, a great
_upkarikalayan_ resting place is described, which is twelve hundred yojanas long
and wide, and its circumference is slightly more than three thousand seven
hundred ninety-five yojanas. Its thickness is half a _kos_ (one thousand
_dhanus_). It is entirely made of gold, pure and perfect. This _upkarikalayan_
is surrounded on all sides by a _padmavaravedika_ and a forest. The description
of the _padmavaravedika_ and the forest should be mentioned, as the
_vanavyantar_ gods and goddesses dwell there, experiencing auspicious and
virtuous fruits. That forest is slightly less than two yojanas in circumference
and has a circumference equal to the _upkarikalayan_ (slightly more than 3795
yojanas). In the four directions of that _upkarikalayan_, four
_trisopanapratirupaka_ are described. Their description should be mentioned. In
front of those _trisopanapratirupaka_, there are separate _torana_ described,
with umbrellas upon umbrellas. Above that _upkarikalayan_, a multi-splendid land
is described, adorned with jewels. The description of the jewels should be
mentioned. The smell, taste, and touch of the jewels should be described. In the
very center of that multi-splendid land, a great _mula prasadavatansaka_ is
described. That _prasadavatansaka_ is sixty-two and a half yojanas high and
thirty-one yojanas and one _kos_ long and wide. It appears to be laughing with
rays of light emanating from all sides. The previous description should be
known. Inside that _prasadavatansaka_, a multi-splendid land is described, with
the touch of jewels and various paintings on the walls. In the very center of
that multi-splendid land, a great _manipithika_ is described. It is one yojana
long and wide and half a yojana thick. It is made entirely of jewels, pure and
soft. Above that _manipithika_, there is a great throne. The description of the
throne, along with its family, should be mentioned. Above that
_prasadavatansaka_, there are many eight-eight auspicious symbols, flags, and
umbrellas upon umbrellas. Those _prasadavatansaka_ are surrounded on all sides
by four other _prasadavatansaka_ which are half their height. Those
_prasadavatansaka_ are thirty-one yojanas and one _kos_ high, fifteen and a half
yojanas long and wide, half a _kos_ thick, and adorned with rays of light. The
same description should be mentioned. Inside those _prasadavatansaka_, there is
a multi-splendid land with painted ceilings. In the very center of those multi-
splendid lands, there are separate thrones in each. The description of the
thrones should be mentioned. There are _bhadraasana_ described there, equal to
the family of those thrones. Above those _prasadavatansaka_, there are many
auspicious symbols, flags, and umbrellas upon umbrellas. 1. The commentator has
written, "The _pithika_ of the _prasadavatansaka_ etc. of the capital city,"
meaning that it is called " _upkaryoparakara_ " elsewhere. It is said, "
_Grihasthanam smritam rajnām upkaryoparakara_ " (The dwelling place of kings is
remembered as _upkaryoparakara_). 2. In the commentary, it is said, " _Navarama
simhasanānām seshāni parivāra bhūtāni na vaktavyāni_ " (The remaining parts of
the nine thrones, which are part of the family, are not to be mentioned).

[Third Chapter: Description of the Uppaata Sabha] [399 In the north-east of the
Uttarapura, there is a great assembly hall called the Uppaata Sabha. The throne
is empty, devoid of any attendants. In front of the throne, there is a great
repository of scriptures. The repository is adorned with the following:
reddish-brown silk cloth, reddish-brown silk ribbons, reddish-brown silk flags,
reddish-brown silk letters, golden threads, jewel-studded knots, silver-plated
inscriptions, golden ornaments, a reddish-brown inkwell, a white writing
implement, and a Dharma-sastra.  /  The Uppaata Sabha also has eight auspicious
flags, banners, and umbrellas of the highest quality.  /  In the north-east of
the Uppaata Sabha, there is a great sacrificial altar, twelve yojanas long and
wide, and six yojanas high, made of all precious stones and very clean.  /  In
the north-east of the sacrificial altar, there is a great pond called the
Nandapushkarini.  /  [140 /  In the north-east of the Siddhaayatana, there is a
great Uppaata Sabha.  All the descriptions of the Sudharmasabha, including the

[400] In the very center of that multi-auspicious land, there is said to be a
large Mani-pitha. It is one yojana long and wide, and half a yojana thick,
entirely made of jewels and pure. Above that Mani-pitha is a large throne. Here,
the description of the throne should be given, not the description of the
family. On that throne, the materials worthy of Vijayadeva's coronation are
placed. Above the coronation assembly, there should be eight auspicious symbols,
flags, and umbrellas, which are of excellent shape and adorned with sixteen
jewels. To the northeast of that coronation assembly is a vast decoration
assembly. Its description should be similar to that of the coronation assembly,
extending to the Go-mansi. The description of the Mani-pitha should also be
known to be similar to that of the coronation assembly. On that Mani-pitha, the
throne with the family should be described. On that throne, there are many
materials worthy of Vijayadeva's adornment. Above that decoration assembly,
there are eight auspicious symbols, flags, and umbrellas, which are of excellent
shape and adorned with jewels. To the northeast of that decoration assembly,
there is said to be a large business assembly. All the descriptions, up to the
throne without the family, should be similar to that of the coronation assembly.
On that throne, Vijayadeva's book-jewel is placed. The description of that book-
jewel is as follows: its cover is of Risht-ratna, its pages are of silver, its
letters are of Risht-ratna, its thread (in which the pages are strung) is of
malleable gold, its knots on the thread (so that the pages do not come apart)
are of various jewels, its inkpot is of Vaidurya-ratna, its inkpot's chain is of
malleable gold, its lid is of Risht-ratna, its ink is of Risht-ratna, and its
pen is of Vajra-ratna. That book is a religious scripture. Above that business
assembly, there are eight auspicious symbols, flags, and umbrellas, which are of
excellent type and adorned with all jewels. To the northeast of that business
assembly is a vast sacrificial altar. It is two yojanas long and wide, and one
yojana thick. It is entirely made of jewels, pure, and perfect in form. To the
northeast of that sacrificial altar is said to be a large Nand-pushkarini. Its
size and other descriptions should be known to be similar to the previously
described lake. Vijayadeva's arrival and his coronation 141. (1) At that time,
at that moment, Vijayadeva, the victorious, the king, in the assembly of
arrival, in the divine abode, in the divine interval, at a distance of countless
parts of an angula, was adorned with the radiance of Vijayadeva. Then, that
Vijayadeva, being adorned with such radiance, and being in the state of Samadhi,
attained the five types of restraint, namely: restraint of food, restraint of
body, restraint of senses, restraint of breath, and restraint of speech. Then,
that Vijayadeva, having attained the state of the five types of restraint, with
such a mind, with such a thought, with such a path, with such a mind, with such
a resolve, arose the thought: "What was mine before? What is mine now? What
should I do before? What should I do now? 1. The text mentions "in the assembly
of arrival".

The translation preserving the Jain terms is as follows:  The Third Pratipasi:
The Upapata (Manifestation) of Vijaydev and His Abhisheka (Consecration)  [401]
"Karanijaṃ ki me puggavi vā pacchā vā hiyāe suhāe khemāe nissesāe anugāmiyattāe
bhavissato" iti kaṭṭa evaṃ saṃpeheti. Then, the sāmāniya (attendant) devas of
Vijaydev, knowing this kind of adhyavasāya (resolve), citta (thought), prārthita
(prayer) and manogata-saṃkappa (mental intention) of Vijaydev, approach him.
Approaching, they pay obeisance to Vijaydev with folded hands on the head,
saying "Jaya-vijaya!" Having paid obeisance with "Jaya-vijaya!", they speak
thus: "O devaanupiya (dear to the gods)! In the siddhaayatana (sacred precincts)
of your Vijayarājadhānī (capital city of Vijaya), there are one hundred and
eight jina-pratimaas (Jina statues) of the measure of the jināvasesa (height of
the Jinas), and in the Sudharmā-sabhā (the assembly hall), on the maṇavaka-
caitya-stambhas (pillars of the assembly hall), there are many jina-kaṭhās
(relics of the Jinas) placed in vajra-maya-golavaṭṭa-samuggayas (spherical
caskets made of vajra). These are to be worshipped, venerated, honoured,
respected, and properly attended by you, the devaanupiya, and by many other
devas and devis (divine beings) of the Vijayarājadhānī. This is indeed the best
for you in the past, this is indeed the best for you in the future. Thus, what
is to be done by the devaanupiya in the past or in the future, until the
attainment of final liberation, will be beneficial, pleasant, auspicious, and
conducive to the next life." Saying this, they joyfully proclaim "Jaya-jaya-
pauṃjaṃti!"  [141] (1) At that time and moment, Vijaydev was born in the form of
Vijaydev within the divine couch in the upapāta-sabhā (manifestation assembly)
of the Vijayarājadhānī, with a body the size of the innumerable part of a
finger. Then, immediately after his birth, Vijaydev became endowed with the five
paryāptis (completeness): 1) āhāra-paryāpti (completeness of food intake), 2)
śarīra-paryāpti (completeness of the body), 3) indriya-paryāpti (completeness of
the senses), 4) pāna-prāṇa-paryāpti (completeness of drinking and breathing),
and 5) bhāṣā-mana-paryāpti (completeness of speech and mind).

402] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra] For the Devānupriya, it is auspicious in the past,
and it is auspicious in the future; this is to be done for the Devānupriya in
the past, and it is to be done in the future; this is beneficial for the
Devānupriya, both in the past and in the future, and will always be with him.
Saying this, they loudly use the word "Jay-Jaykar". 141. [2] Hearing this from
the Devānupriya, Vijayadeva was delighted and pleased, his heart blossomed. He
rose from the Devashyaniya and donned the Devadushya pair. Wearing them, he
descended from the Devashyaniya and went out through the eastern gate of the
Uppapatasabha. He went towards the Hrad (lake) and circumambulated it. Entering
through the eastern torana, he descended from the Trisopanapratirupa and entered
the water. He performed Jalavagahan (immersion in water) and Jalakrida (water
sports). Thus, becoming extremely pure and holy, he emerged from the Hrad and
went towards the Abhishekasabha. Circumambulating the Abhishekasabha, he entered
through the eastern gate and went towards the throne. He sat on the throne
facing the east. [141] (3) Then, the Devānupriya, along with the Devānupriya's
Samaniyapariso, said to Vijayadeva, "O Devānupriya! We will perform a great,
glorious, and magnificent Abhisheka for you." Hearing this, the Devānupriya,
along with the Samaniyapariso, were delighted and pleased. They clasped their
hands together, bowed their heads, and said, "O Devānupriya! We accept your
command and obey your words." Having said this, they went to the eastern
Visimag, and from there, they performed Samohan (a ritual of showering
blessings) with Veubdhiyasamugdha (a special type of water). They then released
a Dand (a unit of measurement) of Sankhejjai (a type of flower) for a distance
of many Yojanas (a unit of measurement). They also showered the Devānupriya with
a multitude of precious stones and jewels. They then performed Samohan with
Veubdhiyasamugdha again. They then offered 8,000 golden Kalasas (pots) and 8,000
silver Kalasas.

[404] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra] When the Samvosahisiddhatha has attained the state
of Sarasa Gosi Sachandana, they take it, and by taking it, they reach the
Somanasavana. Having reached the Somanasavana, they take the Sarasa Gosi
Sachandana, which is divine and fragrant, and by taking it, they reach the
Pandagavana. Having reached the Pandagavana, they take the Sarasa Gosi
Sachandana, which is divine, fragrant, and has a sweet scent, and by taking it,
they all come together. Having come together, they leave the Jambudvipa through
the northern gate. Having left, they go to the Devagati in the direction of the
sky, where they pass through countless islands and oceans, and by the power of
their victory, they reach the Rajahani. Having reached the Rajahani, they
perform the Abhisheya Sabha, and by the power of their victory, they reach the
Vijayadeva. Having reached the Vijayadeva, they accept the Karayala Pariggahiya,
place their hands in a gesture of respect on their heads, and say to the
Vijayadeva: "O Vijayadeva, your greatness, your magnificence, your glory, your
vastness, and your Abhisheya are worthy of praise." / [141] (3) After that, the
Vijayadeva summoned the gods of the Samanika Parshada and said to his servants:
"O Devanupriyo! Quickly prepare for the Maharth (which involves the use of great
wealth, including jewels), Mahagh (worthy of great worship), Maharsh (worthy of
great celebration), and Vipula Indraabhisheka of Vijayadeva." Upon hearing this,
the servants of the Samanika Parshada were overjoyed and their hearts expanded.
With folded hands and their palms placed on their heads, they said: "O Deva!
Your command is our law." They humbly accepted the command. They go in the
northeast direction and, with the power of their Vikriya, they extend their
bodies to a distance of countless yojanas (i.e., they extend their bodies
outward in the form of a staff, with a height and width of countless yojanas,
according to the size of their bodies). They release all kinds of badar
pudgalas, including jewels and other precious substances, and they take in the
subtle pudgalas. / After that, they again extend their bodies with the power of
their Vikriya and create one thousand eight golden kalasas, one thousand eight
silver kalasas, one thousand eight kalasas made of jewels, one thousand eight
kalasas made of gold and silver, one thousand eight kalasas made of gold and
jewels, one thousand eight kalasas made of silver and jewels, one thousand eight
earthen kalasas, one thousand eight jhariyas, and similarly, pradarshakas,
sthalas, patris, supratisthakas, chitra, ratnakarandakas, pushpachangeriyas,
lomahastakachangeriyas, pushpapatlakas, lomahastapatlakas, one hundred eight
simhasanas, chatras, chamaras, dhwajas, (vartak, tapasipra, kshauraka, pinaka),
telasamudgak, and one hundred eight dhupa kaduchchukas (incense burners). They
take these natural and Vikriya-created kalasas, etc., and dhupa kaduchchukas,
and leave the Vijayarajadhani. They travel through the excellent and brilliant
divine Devagati, passing through countless islands and oceans, and reach the
Kshirodasamudra. They take the Kshirodak from there and collect the utpala,
kamala, etc., including the satapatra and sahasrapatra. From there, they go to
the Pushkarodasamudra and take the Pushkarodak and the utpala, kamala, etc.,
including the satapatra and sahasrapatra. / From there, they go to the time-
space where the Bharat-Airavat varsha (regions) are located, and where the
Magadha, Varadama, and Prabhasa tirthas are located. They take the prakar
tirthodak and the soil of the tirthas and go to the Ganga-Sindhu, Rakta-
Raktavati mahanadis (great rivers). They take the water from there and the soil
from the banks of the rivers, and then they go to the...

Quickly bring the alankarik-bhaṇḍa (ornaments) for Vijaydev." The Abhiyogi-devas
bring the alankarik-bhaṇḍa.   Then, Vijaydev first wipes his body with a soft,
divine, fragrant, and saffron-colored towel. After wiping his body, he applies a
fragrant paste of sandalwood to his body. After applying the paste, he adorns
himself with a pair of divine, heavenly earrings, which are light as a breath of
air, captivating to the eyes, beautiful in color, soft to the touch, softer and
whiter than a horse's saliva, with gold threads woven into their edges, as clear
as the sky and a crystal gem, and flawless.   Then, he wears a garland, and a
necklace of pearls, a necklace of gold, and a necklace of gems. He wears
bracelets, armlets, arm bands, and rings on all ten fingers. He wears a waist
belt, a special ornament called a tri-asthi-sutra, a murvi, a kantha-murvi, a
pralamba, earrings, a chudamani, and a crown adorned with many kinds of gems. He
adorns himself with four types of garlands - granthim, veshtim, purim, and
sanghatim - making himself like a Kalpavriksha. Then, he perfumes his body with
the fragrant scent of Malay sandalwood and adorns himself with a garland of
divine flowers.   Thereafter, Vijaydev, adorned with four types of ornaments -
keshalankara, vastralankara, malyalankara, and abharanalanakara - and fully
adorned, rises from the throne. He exits through the eastern gate of the
alankara-sabha and proceeds towards the vyavsayasabha. After circumambulating
the vyavsayasabha, he enters through its eastern gate. Reaching the throne, he
sits upon it facing east.   Thereafter, the Abhiyogi-devas of Vijaydev bring a
book of gems and present it to him. Vijaydev accepts the book of gems, places it
on his lap, opens it, and reads it. After reading the book of gems, he
understands its religious essence (he desires to perform the duties outlined in
it). Then, he places the book of gems there, rises from the throne, and exits
through the eastern gate of the vyavsayasabha.

[414] He finds the Nandapushkarini, which is in the Jeeva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra. He
circumambulates the Nandapushkarini and enters it through the eastern door. He
descends from the three-step-like structure in the east, washes his hands and
feet, and takes a large, heavy, white, silver, pure-water-filled vessel shaped
like the mouth of a rutting elephant. He takes the lotus flowers there,
including the hundred-petaled and thousand-petaled lotuses, and exits the
Nandapushkarini. He resolves to go towards the Siddhayatan (and starts going
that way). 142. [2] Then, four Saamania-Sahassi, along with many other celestial
beings, gods and goddesses, follow Vijayadeva, holding lotuses in their hands,

## Third Chapter: The Birth and Coronation of Vijaydev  [415] The Salamanjiya,
with a Lomahththa, anointed Vijaydev. After anointing him, he adorned him with a
five-fingered, fragrant, sandalwood paste. After adorning him, he wiped him with
a cloth and dressed him. After dressing him, he performed the flower offering
and adorned him with ornaments. After adorning him, he performed the Asattasatta
Viulavattayagghariyamallavamakalaavam. After performing that, he performed the
Kayaggahagiya, followed by the Pushpayujokyarakaliya. After performing that, he
offered incense. After offering incense, he approached the assembly of the great
ones with his face covered. Upon approaching the assembly of the great ones, he
anointed him with a Lomahththa. After anointing him, he offered him food and
drink. After offering him food and drink, he adorned him with a five-fingered,
fragrant, sandalwood paste, forming a circle. After adorning him, he wiped him
with a cloth and dressed him. He performed the Kayaggahagiya, followed by the
previous offerings. After performing those, he approached the assembly of the
great ones, standing on his right foot. [142]  (2) Afterwards, four thousand
Samanika Devas, along with many other Vanavyantara Devas and Devis, followed
Vijaydev. Some carried lotus flowers in their hands, while others carried
hundred-petaled or thousand-petaled lotus flowers. Many Abhiyogi Devas and Devis
followed Vijaydev, some carrying kalashas in their hands, while others carried
incense holders. Then, Vijaydev, accompanied by four thousand Samanika Devas,
along with many other Vanavyantara Devas and Devis, surrounded by all kinds of
Riddhis and Yuthis, and amidst the sound of musical instruments, reached the
Siddhayatana. He circumambulated the Siddhayatana and entered through the
eastern gate. He reached the Devachandaka and bowed to the Jina images. He then
took a Lomahththa and cleansed the Jina images. He bathed them with fragrant
water and wiped their limbs with a divine, fragrant, gandhakaṣāyika (towel). He
applied fragrant, sandalwood paste to their bodies. He adorned the Jina images
with Akshat, white and divine Devadūṣya-yugala, and worshipped them with the
best, primary fragrances and garlands. After worshipping them, he offered
flowers, fragrances, garlands, and colored powders (kesaradi) and ornaments. He
then adorned them with large, round, hanging garlands, extending from top to
bottom. Afterwards, he inscribed auspicious symbols in front of the Jina images
with clean, white, silver, and shining rice. These auspicious symbols included
the swastika, the śrīvatsa, and the mirror. After inscribing these auspicious
symbols, he performed the Pushpopachara (flower offering) with five-year-old
flowers, taken from the Kachagraha and released from the Karatala. He offered
incense with a pure stick, adorned with Chandrakant, Vajra, and Vaidurya gems,
and decorated with gold, gems, and various forms of precious stones. The incense
was made with the best fragrances of black agarwood, superior kunduruka, and
loban. He offered incense with a Vaidurya incense holder, carefully moving back
seven or eight steps. He then praised the Jinas with one hundred and eight pure
Granthas (word references), containing Mahachandas, meaningful, and non-
repetitive stotras. After praising them, he raised his left knee, placed his
right knee on the ground, and bowed his head to the ground three times. He then
raised his head slightly, contracted his arms, which were supported by his
Kataka and Trutita (armlet), joined his hands, placed his palms on his forehead,
and said, "Namaskara to the Arihant Bhagavantas, and to all those who have
attained the Siddhigatinamasthana."

[Third Incarnation: The Arrival and Coronation of Vijayadev] [419] Then, from
there, Vijayadev, with his four thousand Saamanik Devas and sixteen thousand
Praayaksha Deva, with all his retinue, accompanied by the sound of drums and
cymbals, arrives at the Sudharma Sabha. After circumambulating it, he enters
through the eastern gate. Upon entering, he prostrates before the Jina-bones,
and then proceeds to the Manipethika, the Maanavak Chaitya-stambha, and the
circular receptacles of Vajraratna. He takes a lomahrasta (a whisk made of yak
hair) and cleanses these circular receptacles, opening them and then cleansing
the Jina-bones within with the lomahrasta. He washes them twenty-one times with
fragrant water, applies a paste of sandalwood, and worships them with the finest
perfumes and garlands, offering incense. He then places them back in the
circular receptacles. He then cleanses the Maanavak Chaitya-stambha with the
lomahrasta, sprinkles it with divine water, applies a paste of sandalwood,
offers flowers, and places long garlands. He performs a pushpopachara (flower
offering) with scattered flowers of five colors, held in his hand and then
released. He then offers incense. He then proceeds to the center of the Sudharma
Sabha, where the throne is located, and performs the same acts of worship. He
then proceeds to the Manipethika and the Devashayaniya, and performs the same
acts of worship. He then worships the Ksullaka Mahendra-dhvaja (the flag of the
king). He then proceeds to the Chaupalak, the armory, and cleanses the weapons
with the lomahrasta, sprinkles them with divine water, applies sandalwood paste,
offers flowers, and offers incense. He then proceeds to the southern gate of the
Sudharma Sabha and performs the same acts of worship. He then exits through the
southern gate. The rest of the narrative should be described like the
Siddhayatana, including the worship of the Nandapushkarini in the east. The
worship of all the Sabhas should be understood like the Sudharma Sabha. The
difference is that in the Upapat Sabha, the worship of the Devashayaniya should
be described, and in the other Sabhas, the worship of the thrones should be
described. The worship of the Hrad should be described like the Nandapushkarini.
In the Vyavsaya Sabha, he cleanses the Pustakarata (the book of knowledge) with
the lomahrasta, sprinkles it with divine water, applies sandalwood paste, and
worships it with the finest perfumes and garlands. He then cleanses the throne
and offers incense. The rest of the narrative should be described as before. The
Hrad should be described like the Nandapushkarini. He then proceeds to the
Balipith (the sacrificial altar) and performs the same acts of worship. He then
calls upon the Abhiyogi Devas and says to them, "O Karna...

## Third Rebirth: The Vaidyant and Other Gates  [423] At the southern end of the
Jambudvipa island, north of the salt sea in the south, is the Vaidyant gate. It
is eight yojanas high and four yojanas wide. All the descriptions should be the
same as those given for the Vijay gate, except that the Vaidyant gate is
eternal.  **Lord! Where is the capital city of Vaidyant deva, called
Vaidyanti?**  **Gautama!** After crossing countless island seas in the southern
direction of the Vaidyant gate, the description should be similar to that of the
Vijay gate, until you reach the great deva named Vaidyant.  **Lord! Where is the
Jayant gate of Jambudvipa?**  **Gautama!** Forty-five thousand yojanas west of
Mount Meru, at the western end of Jambudvipa, east of the salt sea, and beyond
the Shitota river, is the Jayant gate of Jambudvipa.  The same description
should be given until you reach the great deva named Jayant, whose capital city
is located after crossing countless island seas in the western direction of the
Jayant gate. The description is similar to that of the Vijay capital.  **Lord!
Where is the Aparajit gate of Jambudvipa?**  **Gautama!** Forty-five thousand
yojanas north of Mount Meru, at the northern end of Jambudvipa, south of the
northern part of the salt sea, is the Aparajit gate of Jambudvipa. Its
description is similar to that of the Vijay gate.  Its capital city is located
after crossing countless island seas in the northern direction of the Aparajit
gate. The description is similar to that of the Vijay capital, until you reach
the great deva named Aparajit.  These four capitals are not in this famous
Jambudvipa, but in another Jambudvipa.  **145. Lord! What is the distance
between these gates of Jambudvipa?**  **Gautama!** The distance between each
gate is said to be nineteen thousand fifty-two yojanas and half a yojana. [79052
yojanas and half a yojana]  **Explanation:** The distance between each gate is
said to be nineteen thousand fifty-two yojanas and half a yojana. This is
explained as follows: Each gate has a branch-like structure [wall] that is one
kos thick, and each gate is four yojanas wide. Thus, the total width of the four
gates and their walls is fifteen yojanas. The circumference of Jambudvipa is
three lakh sixteen thousand two hundred twenty-seven [316227] yojanas, three
kos, one hundred eight dhanus, and slightly more than thirteen angulas.   From
this, the total width of the four gates and their branch-like structures is
eighteen...

[424] If the measure of the *jiva-jiva-abhigamsutra* is reduced, the measure of
the circumference remains 316209 *yojana*, 3 *kos*, 108 *dhanush* and 13.5
*angula* more. Dividing this into four parts, we get 79052 *yojana*, 1 *kos*,
1532 *dhanush*, 3 *angula* and 3 *yava*. This much should be understood as the
distance between one gate and another. This same thing is expressed in the
following two verses:  * *Kududuvara-pamanam attarasa jojanai parihe. So hi ya

## Third Chapter: Why is it called Jambudvipa?  [425 Discussion - The presented
sutra asks why the regions touching the salt sea of Jambudvipa are called
Jambudvipa or the salt sea? This means, are the extreme regions within their own
boundaries called Jambudvipa or the salt sea? Because whatever touches something
is called by that name in relation to it, like the country of Magadha, which is
connected to Saurashtra, is called Saurashtra. Sometimes, it is not called by
that name in relation to something, like the index finger, which touches the
middle finger, is not called the index finger. Because both situations exist,
this type of question is asked here. In response, the Lord said that the extreme
regions touching Jambudvipa belong to Jambudvipa, not the salt sea. The same
should be understood about the regions of the salt sea. Regarding the questions
about dying in Jambudvipa and being born in the salt sea, and dying in the salt
sea and being born in Jambudvipa, it has been said that some beings are born
there and some are not, because beings go to different paths due to their
various karmas.  Why is it called Jambudvipa? 147. "Why is it called Jambudvipa,
Venerable One?" "Gautama, the island called Jambudvipa is located north of Mount
Meru, south of the Neelavant mountain, west of the Malavant Vakshkar mountain,
and east of the Gandhamadana Vakshkar mountain. There is a region called
Uttarakura, which is long from east to west and wide from north to south, shaped
like a crescent moon, with a diameter of eleven thousand yojanas, eight hundred
and twenty-nine yojanas and nineteen parts of a yojana.   There are two Vakshkar
mountains on either side of this region, one in the east and one in the west.
The Vakshkar mountain in the east is located in the east, and the Vakshkar
mountain in the west is located in the west. The length of this region is one
thousand yojanas. Its circumference is measured as six thousand yojanas, four
hundred and eighteen yojanas, twelve yojanas and twenty-one parts of a yojana.
Venerable One, what is the nature of the Uttarakura region?" "Gautama, it is a
region with many beautiful things. It is considered to be a region of the gods,
like the Aalingapukhkhara, the Ekkoorayadvipa, and the Devalokapariggaha.   In
this region, six thousand six hundred and sixty-six pitukaranḍas of adumbhatta
food are produced every day. It is said that three palis of this food are
consumed by the gods, and the remaining part is used for the nourishment of the
gods. The rest is used for other purposes.   In the Uttarakura region, six types
of beings live. They are: 1. Pamhagandha, 2. Miyagandha, 3. Amma, 4. Saha, 5.
Teyalise, 6. Sanichari." [147]

[426] The Jivajivabhigamasutra is shaped like a semi-circle. Its diameter
[width] is eleven thousand eight hundred forty-two yojanas and one part of a
yojana [1184211 yojanas]. Its chord is long from east to west. And it touches
the Vaksaskar mountains on both sides. It touches the Vaksaskar mountain on the
east side from the east end and the Vaksaskar mountain on the west side from the
west end. This chord is fifty-three thousand [53000 yojanas] long. The
Dhanushprith of this Uttarakura is sixty thousand four hundred eighteen yojanas
and one yojana [604181 yojanas] in the south direction. This Dhanushprith is in
the form of a circumference. O Bhagavan! What is the shape and form of
Uttarakura? Gautama! The land of Uttarakura is very even and beautiful. That
land is as flat as the stretched skin of a Mruj-Mridanga [drum]. All the
descriptions should be said according to the statement of the Ekoruk island. O
Ayushman Shraman! Those humans are born in Devalok after death. The difference
is that their height is six thousand Dhanush [three Kos]. They have two hundred
and fifty-six ribs. They feel the desire for food after three days. Their lowest
state is three Palyopama and their highest state is three Palyopama. They take
care of their offspring for 49 days. The rest should be known like the Ekoruk
humans. Six types of humans are born in the Uttarakura region, namely 1.
Padmagandha, 2. Mrigagandha, 3. Amam, 4. Sah, 5. Teyalis [Tejasvi] and 6.
Shanaischari. Discussion - The Uttarakura region is long from east to west and
spread [wide] from north to south. Its structure is like a semi-circle like the
eighth moon. Its extent is 1184221 yojanas in the north-south direction. It is
fructified in this way - In the Mahavideha region, there is a region called
Uttarakura to the north of Meru. To the south is Dakshinakura. Therefore, the
extent of the Mahavideha region, minus the extent of the Meru mountain, becomes
the extent of the chord. When it is halved, the measure that comes is the extent
of Dakshinakura and Uttarakura. The extent of the Mahavideha region is 33684
yojanas. In this, the extent of Meru, 10000 yojanas, should be subtracted, then
236843 remains. When it is divided into two parts, it becomes 11842% yojanas.
This is the extent of Uttarakura and Dakshinakura. Its chord [Pratyancha] is
extended to the north near the Neel Varshadhar mountain and is long from east to
west. It touches the Malavant Vaksaskar mountain from its east end and the
Gandhamadana Vaksaskar mountain from its west end. This chord is 53000 [fifty-
three thousand] yojanas long. The measure of its length is fructified in this
way - The length of each of the Bhadrashal forests in the east and west
directions of the Meru mountain is 22000 [twenty-two thousand] yojanas, both
together become 44000 yojanas. When the diameter of the Meru mountain, 10000
[ten thousand] yojanas, is added to it, it becomes 54000 [fifty-four thousand]
yojanas. From this measure, both 1. 'Vaideha Vikkhamba Mandar Vikkhamba
Sohiyapaddatan Kuruvikkhambam Janasu'. 2. 'Mandarpuvvenaayaaya Viseshasahas
Bhaisala Vanam Dugunam Madaramhiyam Dusela Rahiyam Cha Kurujiva'.

## The Third Question: Why is Jambudvipa called Jambudvipa?  [427 Bakshaskar
mountains, subtracting 500-500 yojanas of their height, leaves 36,000 yojanas.
This is the measure of the Jeeva. The Dhanushprith (arc) of the Uttarakurus is
6,041,813 yojanas to the south. The length of the Gandhamadana and Malyaavant
Bakshaskar mountains is the same as the Dhanushprith (circumference) of the
Uttarakurus. The Gandhamadana and Malyaavant mountains each measure 30,209
yojanas. The total measure of both is 60,418 yojanas. This is the measure of the
Dhanushprith of the Uttarakurus.  When asked about the nature of the Uttarakuru
region, the Sutrakar has exaggerated the description of the Ekoruk island. That
is, one should know that all descriptions are similar to the aforementioned
Ekoruk island. The Sutrakar has explicitly revealed the difference through a
Sutra, which is as follows: "The people of Uttarakuru are six thousand Dhanush
(three Kos) long, they have 256 ribs, they desire food after an interval of
three days, their lifespan is from a fraction of a Palyopamasankhyeya to three
Palyopamas in the lowest state and three Palyopamas in the highest state, and
they nurture their offspring for 49 days." One should know the rest of the
description of the people of Ekoruk island according to the description, as
these people die and go to Devaloka.  There are six types of people in the
Uttarakurus, based on their caste: 1. Padmagandha (those with the fragrance of
lotus), 2. Mrigagandha (those with the fragrance of deer), 3. Amam (those
without attachment), 4. Sah (those who are tolerant), 5. Teyalise (those who are
radiant), and 6. Shanaischari (those who walk slowly).  According to the Vritti,
the following three verses summarize the topics discussed regarding the
Uttarakuru region:  "Ishoo Jeeva Dhanuprith, Bhoomi Gumma, Heruudala,
Tilgalayaavanrai, Rukkha, Manuya, Ahare." / 1 /  "Geha, Gama, Hirannaraya, Das,
Maya, Parivarie, Mittre, Vivaah, Mah, Natra, Sagda." / 2 /  "Aasa, Gaavo, Siha,
Sali, Khaanu, Gaddadansahi, Gahjuddh, Rogathi, Uvvattana, Anusajjana Chev." / 3
/  The meaning of the above verses is as follows: First, the Ishoo, Jeeva, and
Dhanushprith are discussed regarding the Uttarakuru. Then, there is a statement
about the land, followed by a description of the Gulma, then the description of
forests like Herutal, then the description of trees like Uddal, then the
description of trees like Tilka, creepers, and forest kings.  1. "Aayamo Selanam
Donhvi Miligo Kurunadhanu Pudhe." 2. The Vrittikar has provided a detailed
explanation of the form, nature, and evolution of the Uttarakuru, along with the
original text. This suggests that the original manuscripts available to them
must have contained a complete description in the original text. The currently
available manuscripts contain an exaggerated text. Where the Sutrakar has
described the Ekoruk island, the Vrittikar has not explained it, but has simply
written that the explanation of the Uttarakuru should be understood here. The
point to consider here is why the Vrittikar has exaggerated the topic to be
discussed later?

[Jīvājīvābhigamasūtra] After the Jīvājīvābhigamasūtra, there is a description of
10 types of Kalpavṛkṣas (wish-fulfilling trees), followed by a description of
the human beings, women, and both men and women living there. After that, there
are sūtras related to food. Then, there is a description of household trees.
After that, it is said that there are no houses, villages, weapons, gold, kings,
slaves, mothers, enemies, friends, marriages, festivals, dances, or vehicles
(carts, etc.) there. Subsequently, while horses, cows, lions, and other animals
do exist, they do not cause any harm or disturbance to the people. Then, there
are sūtras prohibiting the consumption of Śāli and other grains, Sthāṇu and
other substances, and pits, mosquitoes, and other such things. After that, there
are snakes and other creatures, but they do not cause any harm. It is then
stated that there is an absence of planetary disturbances, wars, and diseases.
Following this, the text describes the location, elevation, and dimensions of
the two Jambudvīpa mountains called Jamgā.  The Jamgā mountains are described as
being located north of the Uttarakuru region, across a vast ocean, in another
Jambudvīpa. Each of the two Jamgā mountains is said to be 1,000 yojanas
(approximately 8,000 km) in height, with a circumference of 100 yojanas
(approximately 800 km) at the base, 75 yojanas (approximately 600 km) in the
middle, and 15 yojanas (approximately 120 km) at the top. The mountains are
described as being separated, narrow at the top, and made of pure gold. They are
surrounded by beautiful lotus ponds and forests. The text further states that
there are many pleasant regions on these mountains, where the Jamgā devas
(celestial beings) reside. These Jamgā devas are said to be of great power and
majesty, and they protect and govern the Jamgā mountains and their associated
regions, as well as many other celestial beings.

## Third Question: Why is Jambudvipa called Jambudvipa? [148]  O Bhagavan! Where
are the two mountains called Yamaka located in the region called Uttar Kuru?
Gautama! Eight hundred and thirty-four yojanas south of the Neelavant Varshadhar
mountain, and one yojana further, on both the eastern and western banks of the
great river Shita, in the Uttar Kuru region, are located two mountains called
Yamaka. These mountains are each one thousand yojanas high, two hundred and
fifty yojanas deep in the earth, one thousand yojanas long and wide at the base,
seven hundred and fifty yojanas long and wide in the middle, and five hundred
yojanas in diameter at the top. Their circumference at the base is slightly more
than three thousand one hundred and sixty-two yojanas. Their circumference in
the middle is slightly more than two thousand three hundred and seventy-two
yojanas, and their circumference at the top is slightly more than fifteen
hundred and eighty-one yojanas. They are wide at the base, narrow in the middle,
and thin at the top. They are shaped like a peacock's tail, entirely golden,
clean, smooth, and perfect in form. Each mountain is surrounded by a lotus-
shaped platform, and each mountain is adorned with a forest. The description of
both should be given.  Above these Yamaka mountains is a very beautiful land.
Its description should be given, as many Vanavyantar Devas and Devis reside, lie
down, and wander there, experiencing the fruits of their good deeds. In the
middle of these two beautiful lands are two separate Prasadaavatansakas. These
Prasadaavatansakas are sixty-two and a half yojanas high and thirty-one yojanas
and one kos wide. They are sky-touching and high, etc. Their description should
be given. The description of their land, upper inner ceilings, etc., should be
known as before. There is a Mani-pithika of two yojanas there. On it is a
superior throne. These thrones are complete, meaning they are equipped with the
comfortable seats of the Samanika Devas, etc. The Yamaka Devas sit on them.  O
Bhagavan! Why are these Yamaka mountains called Yamaka mountains?  Gautama! On
these Yamaka mountains, there are many small wells here and there, as well as
burrows. In them are many lotus flowers, as well as Shatapatra-Sahasrapatra,
which are shaped like Yamaka (a type of bird), have the same color as Yamaka,
and two great, wealthy Devas reside there, who are in the state of Palyopama.
These Devas reside there, ruling over their four thousand Samanika Devas, as
well as the Yamaka mountains, the Yamaka capitals, and many other Vanavyantar
Devas and Devis, and they nurture them. Therefore, O Gautama! These Yamaka
mountains are called Yamaka mountains.  Another thing, O Gautama! These Yamaka
mountains are eternal, meaning they are permanent. [Meaning, their name 'Yamaka'
is eternal - it has always been and will always be.]  O Bhagavan! Where are the
capitals called Yamaka of these Yamaka Devas?  Gautama! North of these Yamaka
mountains, after crossing countless islands and seas, in another Jambudvipa
different from the famous Jambudvipa, twelve thousand yojanas further, are the
capitals called Yamaka of the Yamaka Devas, which are twelve thousand yojanas in
size, etc. All descriptions should be given as for the Vijaya capital, as two
great, wealthy Devas called Yamaka are their rulers. For this reason, these
Yamaka Devas are called Yamaka Devas.

[149] (1) Bhagavan! Where is the lake called Neelavant located in the Uttarakuru
region?  _ Gautam! In the south of the Yamaka mountains, eight hundred and
thirty-four yojanas and four and seven-eighths yojanas further, in the middle of
the Sita Mahanadi, the lake called Neelavant in the Uttarakuru region is said to

## The Third Question: Why is it called Ambudvipa?  [431] Its thickness is half
a yojana. It is ten yojanas underwater and two kosas [half a yojana] above
water. Together, its height is ten and a half yojanas. The description of the
lotus is as follows: its root is vajra-like, its stem is made of risht gems, its
stalk is made of vaidurya gems, its outer petals are vaidurya-like, its inner
petals are jambunad [golden], its filaments are made of tapaniya gold, its
pollen is golden, and its stigma is made of various gems. The pollen is half a
yojana long and wide, its circumference is three times that plus some, its
thickness is one kosa, it is completely golden, pure, smooth, and perfect. Above
the pollen is a multi-splendid land, its description should be given up to the
touch of the gems. In the exact middle of that multi-splendid land is a vast
building, one kosa long, half a kosa wide, and slightly less than one kosa high.
It is supported by hundreds of pillars, the initial description should be given.
There are three doors in that building, one in the east, one in the south, and
one in the north. These doors are five hundred dhanus high, two hundred and
fifty dhanus wide, and their entrance is the same. They are white, adorned with
a stupa of the finest gold, and garlands are hanging from them.   [149. (2)]
Inside that building, in the multi-splendid land, there are ponds, lakes, and
the color of the gems. In the middle of that multi-splendid land, there is a
gem-studded platform, five hundred dhanus long and wide, eight hundred dhanus
thick, and made of sixty gems. On that gem-studded platform, there is a great
divine bed, the description of the divine bed is as follows. It is surrounded on
all sides by four other beds, each of which is half the size of the main bed.
These beds are half a yojana long and wide, their circumference is three times
that plus some, their thickness is one kosa, and they are ten yojanas high, with
one kosa of water above them. These ten yojanas are considered to be the height
of the beds. The description of these beds is as follows: their roots are vajra-
like, their stems are made of risht gems, their stalks are made of vaidurya
gems, their outer petals are vaidurya-like, their inner petals are jambunad
[golden], their filaments are made of tapaniya gold, their pollen is golden, and
their stigma is made of various gems. These pollens are one kosa long and wide,
their circumference is three times that plus some, their thickness is half a
kosa, they are completely golden, pure, smooth, and perfect. Above these pollens
is a multi-splendid land, its description should be given up to the color,
fragrance, and touch of the gems.   Above that bed, in the north, in the north-
northwest, there are four thousand beds, each of which is equal to the size of
the four thousand beds of the Kumar of Nilavantaha. Thus, the entire family
should be described in terms of its size. These beds are surrounded on all sides
by three other beds, namely the inner, middle, and outer beds. In the inner bed,
there are thirty-two thousand beds, in the middle bed, there are forty thousand
beds, and in the outer bed, there are forty-eight thousand beds. Thus, with all
the beds, there are one hundred million beds and twenty thousand beds.   Where
is this, Venerable? It is said that Nilavantaha, Nilavantaha?

[432] [Jivajovaabhigamsutra Goyama! Neelavanthahahe nam dahe tatya tatya jaim
uppalai jav sayasahasrapattai Neelavantppabhai Neelavanthahahekumarae ya so
cheva gamo jav Neelavanthahahe Neelavanthahahe. [149] [2] That building is
called a Bahusamaramaneya Bhoomibhag. It is as smooth as leather stretched over
a drum [Murja-Mridanga] and should be described as such. This description should
be done as before, including the color, smell, and touch of the jewels. In the
exact middle of that Bahusamaramaneya Bhoomibhag is a Manipithika, which is five
hundred Dhanus long and wide and two hundred and fifty Yojan thick and made of
all jewels. Above that Manipithika is a vast Devashayaniya, which should be
described as before. It is surrounded on all sides by one hundred and eight
lotuses. Those lotuses are half the height of that lotus. Those lotuses are half
a Yojan long and wide and their circumference is slightly more than three times
that. Their thickness is one Kos. They are submerged in water for ten Yojan
[deep and one Kos high from the water level]. From the water level to the top,
they are slightly more than ten Yojan [one Kos more]. The form of those lotuses
is described as follows: their roots are made of Vajraratnas, and their petals
are made of various jewels. The lotus seeds are one Kos long and wide, and their
circumference is slightly more than three times that, and their thickness is
half a Kos. They are all made of gold, and they are pure and perfect. Above
those seeds is the Bahusamaramaneya Bhoomibhag, and the color, smell, and touch
of the jewels should be described. To the northwest, north, and northeast of
that lotus are four thousand Padmas [lotus-shaped seats] of the four thousand
Samanik Devas of the Nagakumaraendra Nagakumara Raja of the Neelavantdrah.
Similarly, the Padmas [lotus-shaped seats] of all the families should be
described. That lotus is surrounded on all sides by three other
Padmavaraparिक्षेप परिवेश. Those परिवेश are: Prabhyantara, Madhyama, and Bahya.
The Prabhyantara Padma Parivesh has thirty-two lakh Padmas, the Madhyama Padma
Parivesh has forty lakh Padmas, and the Bahya Padma Parivesh has forty-eight
lakh Padmas. Thus, the total number of Padmas is one crore twenty lakh. O
Bhagavan! Why is Neelavantdrah called Neelavantdrah? Gautama! In Neelavantdrah,
there are blue lotuses [Utpala Kamalas] blooming here and there, including those
with a hundred petals and a thousand petals. And there lives a great Dev named
Neelavant, the Nagakumaraendra Nagakumara Raja. Therefore, Neelavantdrah is
called Neelavantdrah. [After this, according to the Vritti, there is a Sutra
about the Neelavanta Rajadhani of Neelavantkumar. It should be described like
the Vijaya Rajadhani.] The authority of the Kanchan Parvatas 150.
Neelavantddahass nam purathim-paccharithamenam dasa joyanai abahaar esth gam

unhenam, mule egamegam joyanasayam vikkhambhenam majjhe pannari joyanai
vikkhambhenam uri 1. The text about the Rajadhani seems to be missing in the
available copies. According to the Vritti, there should be a text about the
Rajadhani.

## The Third Question: What is Jambudvipa?  [433 yojanas in circumference at the
base, 316 yojanas plus a little more in the middle, 277 yojanas plus a little
more in the upper part; wide at the base, narrow in the middle, and thin at the
top, shaped like a cow's tail, entirely made of gold, pure, with pavaravedika
and forest areas around each one. On top of these are many beautiful land areas
where many Vanavyantara gods and goddesses reside. On each of these land areas
are what are called Prasadavatsankas. These Prasadavatsankas are 62 and a half
yojanas high and 31 yojanas wide. They have two yojana wide mani-pithikas and
thrones. These thrones are complete with families, meaning they have
Samanikadevas, chief queens, and other family members, all seated on auspicious
thrones.    O Bhagavan! Why are these called Kanchanaparbata?   Gautama! In the
ponds of these Kanchanaparbata, there are many utpala and kamala, even satapatra
and sahasrapatra kamala, which have the radiance and color of gold. And there
reside great gods named Kanchanaka. Therefore, these are called Kanchanaparbata.
The Kanchanika of these Kanchanaka gods...

[434] The **Jivajivaabhigamsutra** mentions the capitals of the **Kanchanak**
mountains, which are located in another **Jambudvipa** after crossing countless
islands and seas to the north. This description should be understood like the
description of the **Vijaya** capital.  O Lord, where is the **Uttarakurudrah**
of the **Uttarakuru** region mentioned?  Gautam! The **Uttarakurudrah** is
located eight hundred and thirty-four yojanas south of the **Neelavantdrah**,
and all descriptions should be understood like the description of the
**Neelavantdrah**.  All **drahs** have deities with the same name.  All
**drahs** have ten **Kanchanak** mountains to the east and west, with similar
characteristics.  Their capitals are located in another **Jambudvipa** after
crossing countless islands and seas to the north.  Their description should be
understood like the description of the **Vijaya** capital.  Similarly, the same
statements should be made about the **Chandradrah**, **Eravantdrah**, and
**Malavantdrah**.  **Jambuvriksha Vaktvyata 151.**  Where, O Venerable One, is
the **Jambupedha** named **Jambusudansana** located in the **Uttarakura**?
Gotama!  In the **Jambudvipa**, to the north-west of the **Mandara** mountain,
to the south of the **Neelavant** mountain, to the south-east of the
**Malavant** mountain, and to the east of the **Gandhamadana** mountain, on the
eastern bank of the **Sita** river, there is the **Jambupedha** named
**Uttarakura**.  It is five hundred yojanas in length and breadth, fifteen
hundred and one yojanas in circumference, with a slight excess, and twelve
yojanas wide in the middle.  Then, gradually, it becomes narrower, and finally,
it is two kosas wide at the ends.  It extends throughout the **Jambudvipa**,
from one end to the other.  It is surrounded on all sides by a single
**Paumvaraveiya** and a single **Vanasanda**.  Its color is two-fold.  The
**Jambupedha** has four **Tisovanapidiruva** on all four sides, which extend
from the **Torana** to the **ChhataiChhatai**.  The **Jambupedha** has a very
beautiful land area, which extends from the **Aalingapukkhara** to the **Manin**
**Phaso**.  In the middle of this very beautiful land area, there is a large
**Manipedhiya**, eight yojanas in length and breadth, and four yojanas wide.  It
is made of **Mani** and extends from one end to the other.  On top of this
**Manipedhiya**, there is a large **Jambusudansana**, eight yojanas high, half a
yojana in diameter, two yojanas in width, eight yojanas in breadth, and six
yojanas in circumference.  In the middle, it is eight yojanas in breadth, and
eight yojanas in circumference.  It has **Vairamaya** roots, **Rayyasupitthiya**
circumference, **Cheiyarrushka** color, **Ritthamaya** leaves, **Veruliya**
branches, **Sujaya** flowers, **Varajayaruva** first leaves, **Visalasala**

## Third Chapter: The Jambū Tree  **[435 [151]]**  O Bhagavan! Where is the
Jambūpīṭha, the seat of the Jambū tree, also known as Sudarśanā, in the
Uttarakuru region?  O Gautama! In the northeast [Īśānakoṇa] of the Meru mountain
in Jambūdvīpa, south of the Nīlavant Varṣadhara mountain, west of the Mālavant
Vakṣaskāra mountain, east of the Gandhamādana Vakṣaskāra mountain, on the
eastern bank of the Śītā Mahānādī river, lies the Jambūpīṭha, a seat in the
Uttarakuru region. It is five hundred yojanas long and wide, with a
circumference of slightly more than fifteen hundred eighty-one yojanas. It is
twelve yojanas wide in the middle, gradually decreasing in width due to the loss
of land, and finally becoming two kosas thick at the ends. It is entirely made
of Jambūnanda [gold], pure and perfect. This Jambūpīṭha is surrounded on all
sides by a Padmavaravedikā and a forest. Both should be described.  Four
Trisopanapratirūpaka are mentioned in the four directions of this Jambūpīṭha.
All the descriptions should be given as before. The description of the toranas
and the numerous chatras should be given.  Above this Jambūpīṭha is a very
beautiful land, as smooth as the stretched leather of a Mṛdanga [drum], and the
description should be given as before, up to the touch of the jewels. In the
exact middle of this beautiful land is a large Mani-pīṭhikā, eight yojanas long
and wide, and four yojanas thick. It is made of jewels, pure, smooth, and
perfect. Above this Mani-pīṭhikā is the large Jambū tree, Sudarśanā [also known
as Sudarśanā Apara Jambū], the Jambūvakṣa. This Jambū tree is eight yojanas
high, half a yojana deep in the ground, two yojanas in its trunk, eight yojanas
wide, its branches extend six yojanas, it is eight yojanas wide in the middle,
and more than eight yojanas [eight and a half yojanas] high, including the
height of the roots and the top. Its roots are made of Vajraratna [diamond], its
branches are made of Rajata [silver] and are tall. The description of the
Chaitya tree should be given as before, including its large trunk made of
Riṣṭharatna [ruby], its beautiful [beautiful and Vaidūrya] trunk made of
Vaidūrya, its beautiful and excellent silver branches, its branches and sub-
branches made of various jewels and gems, its leaves made of Vaidūrya, and its
leaf stalks made of Tapanīya Suvarna [gold]. Its coral and buds are made of
Jambūnanda [gold], they are red, soft, and have a soft touch. It has flowers of
various jewels and gems. These flowers are fragrant. Its branches are bent down
by the weight of the fruits. This Jambū tree is beautiful, with a beautiful
glow, beauty, radiance, and gives great satisfaction to the mind. It is
magnificent, beautiful, and perfect.  1. The commentator mentions a different
opinion, saying, "Others say that its roots and branches are made of Suvarna
[gold], and its sub-branches are made of Rajata [silver]." Others say that its
top branches, buds, and shoots are made of Jambūnanda [gold], and its leaves are
made of Rajata [silver].  The following verses from the Sangrahaṇī are relevant
to this topic:  > Its roots are made of Vajra, its trunk is made of Riṣṭha, >
Its branches are made of Suvarna, and its leaves are made of Rajata. // 1 //  >
Its leaves are made of Vaidūrya, its leaf stalks are made of Tatraṇija, > Its
buds and top branches are made of Jambūnanda, and its fruits are made of Rajata.

## Third Chapter: What is Jambudvipa?  There are four Pushkarinis, their names
are Shrikantā, Shrimhitā, Shrichandrā and Shrinilā. The same evidence and the
Prasadavatsaka and its evidence is also the same. 152. [3] In Jambudvipa, to the
north of the eastern building of Sudarshana, and to the south of the
Prasadavatsaka of the north-east, there is a great Kūṭa, eight yojanas high,
twelve yojanas wide at the base, eight yojanas wide in the middle, and four
yojanas wide at the top. The circumference at the base is slightly more than
thirty-seven yojanas, slightly more than twenty-five yojanas in the middle, and
slightly more than twelve yojanas at the top. It is wide at the base, narrow in
the middle, and thin at the top, shaped like a cow's tail, and is made of
Jambunada gold, pure and beautiful. This Kūṭa is surrounded on all sides by a
single Vana-sanda, a single Padma-varavedika. There are two types of trees. In
the upper part of this Kūṭa, there is a vast expanse of land called
Bahusamaramanijja, where there are many Siddha-ayatanas. The size of each
Siddha-ayatan is the same as all the other Siddha-ayatanas.   In Jambudvipa, to
the south of the eastern building of Sudarshana, and to the north of the
Prasadavatsaka of the south-east, there is a great Kūṭa, the size of which is
also a Siddha-ayatan.   In Jambudvipa, to the east of the southern building of
Sudarshana, and to the west of the Prasadavatsaka of the south-east, there is a
great Kūṭa.   To the east of the Prasadavatsaka of the south-west, which is
beyond the southern building, there is a great Kūṭa.   In Jambudvipa, to the
north of the Prasadavatsaka of the south-west, which is to the south of the
western building, there is a great Kūṭa, the size of which is also a Siddha-
ayatan.   In Jambudvipa, to the south of the Prasadavatsaka of the north-west,
which is to the north of the western building, there is a great Kūṭa, the size
of which is also a Siddha-ayatan.   In Jambudvipa, to the east of the
Prasadavatsaka of the north-west, which is to the west of the northern building,
there is a great Kūṭa.   In Jambudvipa, to the west of the Prasadavatsaka of the
north-east, which is to the east of the northern building, there is a great
Kūṭa, the size of which is also a Siddha-ayatan.   152. [3] In Jambudvipa, to
the north of the eastern building of Sudarshana, and to the south of the
Prasadavatsaka of the north-east, there is a great Kūṭa, eight yojanas high,
twelve yojanas wide at the base, eight yojanas wide in the middle, and four
yojanas wide at the top. The circumference at the base is slightly more than
thirty-seven yojanas, slightly more than twenty-five yojanas in the middle, and
slightly more than twelve yojanas at the top. It is wide at the base, narrow in
the middle, and thin at the top, shaped like a cow's tail, and is made of
Jambunada gold, pure and beautiful. This Kūṭa is surrounded on all sides by a
single Vana-sanda, a single Padma-varavedika. There are two types of trees.
According to the commentary, the order of their names is as follows: Shrikantā,
Shrichandrā, Shrinilā and Shrimhitā.   It is said that the four types of
Pushkarinis are:   1. Pauma, Pausappabha, Kumuyā, Kumuyappabha.  2. Uppala,
Gumma, Nalīnā, Uppalā, Uppalujjalā.  3. Bhingā, Bhiganibhā, Anjanna,

## Third Chapter: Why is it called Jambudvipa?  [441] "Tell me, Venerable One!
How is the equality of the Anadrita to be spoken of?" "It is indeed a good
question, Gautama! In Jambudvipa, in various places, there are many Jamburuksha,
Jambavana, and Jambavana-khanda, which are always in bloom and adorned with
splendor. Therefore, Gautama, it is called Jambudvipa."  "It is indeed a good
question, Gautama! The name Jambudvipa is eternal. It was not in the past, it is
not in the present, and it will not be in the future. It is eternal."  [152-4]
The Jambudvipa is surrounded on all sides by many Tilaka trees, Lakuta trees,
Raya trees, and Hingu trees. Above the Jambudvipa, there are many auspicious
symbols like eight-pointed Swastikas, Srivatsas, mirrors, black chowries, flags,
and umbrellas. All this should be known as before.  The Jambudvipa has twelve
names: 1. Sudarshana, 2. Amoha, 3. Suprabuddha, 4. Yashodhara, 5. Videhajambu,
6. Saumanasya, 7. Niyata, 8. Nityamandita, 9. Subhadra, 10. Vishala, 11. Sujata,
12. Sumana. These are the twelve synonyms of the Sudarshana Jambudvipa.
"Venerable One! Why is the Jambudvipa called Jambudvipa?" "Gautama! In the
Jambudvipa, the lord of Jambudvipa, the great god Anadrita, resides. He has a
position of one Palyopama. He rules over the Jambudvipa, the Jambusudarshana,
and the capital city of Anadrita, along with four thousand Samanika gods."
"Venerable One! Where is the capital city of Anadrita?" "Gautama! The complete
description of the Vijaya capital city, which was mentioned earlier, should be
spoken here. The great god Anadrita resides there."  "Gautama! Another reason is
that in the island called Jambudvipa, there are Jamburuksha, Jambavana, and
Jambavana-khanda in various places, which are always in bloom and adorned with
splendor. Therefore, Gautama, it is called Jambudvipa."  "It is also a reason
that Jambudvipa is an eternal name. It was not in the past, it is not in the
present, and it will not be in the future. It is eternal."  The commentary
presented in this sutra mentions twelve names of the Jambudvipa. These names are
meaningful and carry specific connotations. The meaning of these names is as
follows:  1. Sudarshana - It is called Sudarshana because it is extremely
beautiful and pleasing to the eyes. 2. Amoha - It is called Amoha because it
fulfills its name. The lordship of Jambudvipa is meaningful and successful only
because of it, otherwise not. Therefore, it is called Amoha, a name with such
meaning. 3. Suprabuddha - It is always shining with jewels, gold, and gems,
therefore it is called Suprabuddha, awake and not asleep.

Jambudvipa is spread throughout the three worlds, therefore it is appropriate to
call it Yashodhara. 5. Videhajambhu - Because it is located in the
Uttarakurushetra of Jambudvipa under Videha, it is called Videha. 6. Saumanasya
- Because it is the cause of happiness of the mind, it is called Saumanasya. 7.
Niyata - Because it is always present, it is called Niyata. 8. Nityamandita -
Because it is always adorned with ornaments, it is called Nityamandita. 9.
Subhadra - It is always auspicious. Because its presiding deity is Mahaddhik
Deva, it is never troubled. 10. Vishala - Because it is vast, measuring many
yojanas, it is called Vishala. 11. Sujata - Because it is made of pure gems,
gold, and jewels, it is called Sujata - free from birth defects. 12. Sumana -
Because it makes the mind beautiful, it is called Sumana. According to the
Vattikar, the order of these names is as follows: 1. Sudarshana, 2. Amogha, 3.
Suprabuddha, 4. Yashodhara, 5. Subhadra, 6. Vishala, 7. Sujata, 8. Sumana, 9.
Videhajambhu, 10. Saumanasya, 11. Niyata, 12. Nityamandita. The reasons for
calling Jambudvipa as Jambudvipa are as follows: (1) Because it is marked by the
Jambhu tree, it is called Jambudvipa. (2) Because there are many Jambhu trees,
Jambhuvana, and Jambhuvanakhanda in the Uttarakuru region of Jambudvipa, it is
also called Jambudvipa. A community of trees of the same species is called a
forest, and a group of trees of different species is called a forest tract. (3)
Because the name Jambhu is eternal, it is also called Jambudvipa. In Jambudvipa,
the number of moons, etc. is 152. In Jambudvipa, O Venerable! How many moons
shine, are shining, or will shine? How many suns are shining, are shining, or
will shine? How many stars twinkle, are twinkling, or will twinkle? How many
great planets wander, are wandering, or will wander? How many kodi-kodi stars
shine, are shining, or will shine? _ Gotama! In Jambudvipa, there are two moons
that shine, are shining, or will shine. There are two suns that shine, are
shining, or will shine. There are fifty-six stars that twinkle, are twinkling,
or will twinkle. There are seventy-six planets that wander, are wandering, or
will wander. There are one hundred thousand, thirty-three thousand, nine hundred
and fifty kodi-kodi stars that shine, are shining, or will shine. // 1 //

If there is a great fall of stars, one should not study scriptures for one
Prahar. 2. Digdaah - As long as the direction is blood-red, meaning it appears

or when there is thunder with clouds, it is an unfavorable time for study for

This second part of the *Jivajivaabhigamsutra* is being presented as the 31st
volume of the *Jinagam Granthamala* for the students of the *Prakashkiya Pragam*
loving Jain philosophy. The *Jivajivaabhigamsutra* mainly describes in detail
the state of the *jiva* in various situations. It briefly provides a glimpse of
the numerous states of the *jiva* and solves all related queries. It is a means
of providing detailed understanding for ordinary readers. This edition, as per
the defined framework, includes the original text along with its meaning in
Hindi and necessary discussions for clarification. Due to this, the book became
quite extensive and hence is being published in two parts. The first part was
published earlier and this is the second part. The translation, discussion, and
editing of the book has been done by the Up-Pravartak Shri Rajendramuni Ji M.A.,
Ph.D. He had also edited the *Uttaraadhyaayana Sutra*. The *Aetardh* committee
considers him as its senior associate and extends its heartfelt congratulations.
The great scholar, young Acharya Shri Mishrimal Ji "Madhukar" Muni Ji M. had
initiated the sacred ritual to make the entire *Bhagam* literature accessible to
the public. It is a matter of regret that his direct presence is no longer
there, but his indirect blessings have always been received by the committee.
This is the reason why the committee has been progressing in its work and now we
are confident to state that the publication work of *Pragam Battisi* is almost
complete. Finally, we are grateful to all our collaborators for their dedication
and inspiration, due to which the publication work is about to be completed.
Ratanchand Modi, Acting President, Sayarmal Chordia, General Secretary, Shri
Aagam Prakashan Samiti, Byawar (Raj.) Amarchand Modi, Minister.

The editorial continuity of the omniscient, all-seeing, passionless Supreme
Being, Jineswar Deva's nectar-like, path-showing, words are not only a priceless
treasure of the world's religious literature, but also a life-saving elixir for
the lives of all beings. This discourse, preached by the Arihants, is that pot
of nectar which removes all poisons and provides new life to all beings in the
world. The origin of the Jain Agamas is for the protection of the world's
beings, in the form of compassion. Non-violence, compassion, kindness,
affection, and friendship are its essence. Therefore, it is the most beneficial,
protective, and helpful for the beings of the world. This Jain discourse is a
form of salvation, refuge, motion, and foundation for all beings. The ancient
teachers have compared this Agamvani to the ocean. They said, "This Jain Agam is
like a great ocean, it is boundless in knowledge, filled with the best word-
community-like water, it is vast in extent due to being agitated by the endless
waves of non-violence, the tide-like Chula is rising in it, it is filled with
the gems obtained by the grace of the Guru. It is difficult to cross. It is the
ultimate essence and auspicious form. One should worship the ocean of the Agam
of the great Mahavira with devotion." Indeed, the Jain Agam is vast and deep
like the ocean. However, with the grace of the Guru and effort, one can dive
into it and obtain the essential gems. The essence of the Jina discourse is non-
violence and equality. As it is said in the Sutra Kritanga Sutra, "Do not harm
any living being, considering them as your own self, this is the essence of
religion, the path of self-welfare." Jain principles are interwoven with non-
violence, and in today's world, which is burning in the fire of hatred, the
endless stream of non-violence is the only benefit. Therefore, the reading,
study, and practice of Jain principles and their widespread dissemination is the
priority of today's age. Only by practicing non-violence is there a possibility
of world peace, therefore, the study and practice of the Jain Agams, which are
full of non-violence, is absolutely essential. The Jain Agam is in the form of
the twelve-part Ganipitaka. After attaining omniscience, the Arihant Tirthankara
Supreme Being, in the form of words, formulates the discourse, and their
fourteen predecessors, the Ganadharas, who are repositories of vast wisdom, bind
them in the form of sutras. In this way, the tradition of discourse continues.
Therefore, the originator of the Agam in the form of words, the Sri Tirthankara
Supreme Being, 1. Savvajagajivarakhkhnadayattayae, Bhagavaya Pavayanam Kahiyam -
Prashnavyakaran 2. Bodhaagadhham Supapadavi Nirpurabhiram, Jiwahimsa Aviralhari

And the author of the word-form *Magam* is Ganadhara. From time immemorial, the
tradition of Arihants and their Ganadharas has been continuing. Therefore, the
tradition of their teachings in the form of *Magam* has also been continuing
since time immemorial. Therefore, it is said that this *Dwadashangi* is firm,
eternal, everlasting, has always been, never was, is not, will never be. In
terms of feelings, it is firm, eternal, everlasting. *Dwadashangi* includes
twelve parts. *Acharang*, *Suyagdang*, *Thanang*, *Samvayang*,
*Vyakhyaprajnapti*, *Jatadharmakatha*, *Upasakadasha*, *Antakridadasha*,
*Anuttaroppapatik*, *Prashnavyakaran*, *Vipaksutra* and *Dastibad*, these are
the twelve parts. This is the *Dwadashangi* *Ganipitaka*, which is directly
taught by the Tirthankaras. These are called *Angapravisht* *Pagam*. In addition
to these, *Anangapravisht*-*Angabahya* *Agam* are those which are composed by
the venerable *Bhagavants* who are endowed with *prashatishya* and are not
contradictory to the words of the Tirthankaras. Thus, *Jainagam* is divided into
two parts - *Angapravisht* and *Anangapravisht* (*Angabahya*). The present
*Jivajivaabhigam* scripture is *Anangapravisht* *Bhagam*. From another
perspective, the twelve parts are also called the twelve *Upang* of the twelve
parts. Accordingly, *Pippapatik* etc. are given the name *Upang*. Acharya
Malayagiri, who wrote a detailed commentary on *Jivajivaabhigam*, has called it
the *Upang* of the third part - *Sthanang*. In the beginning of the present
*Jivajivaabhigamasutra*, the venerable *Bhagavants* are presented as the
formulators of this study - *Ih khalu Jinamyan Jinanuman Jinanuloma Jinappaniyam
Jinaparuiyam Jinakkhayan Jinanuchinam Jinpannattam Jindeshiyam Jinapasattham
Anuvviiy, Tam Saddhamana, Tam Pattiyamana, Tam Royamana Therabhagavanto
Jivajivaabhigamanamajjayan Pannavinshu*. By contemplating this excellent
*Jinamat*, which is approved by all *Jineshwars*, *Jinanuloma*, *Jinpranit*,
*Jinpraroorit*, *Jinakhyant*, *Jinanuchirn*, *Jinprasapt* and *Jindeshi*, by
having faith, belief and interest in it, the venerable *Bhagavants* formulated
the study called *Jivajivaabhigam*. The above statement clarifies that the
present sutra was composed by the venerable *Bhagavants*. Those venerable
*Bhagavants* were the knowers of the right knowledge of the Tirthankaras'
sermons. They had faith, belief and interest in their words. This implies that
the *Agam* formulated by such venerable ones is also evidence, just as the
*Agam* formulated by the omniscient, all-seeing Tirthankara Paramatma is
evidence. Because the composition of the venerable ones is not contradictory to
the words of the Tirthankaras. The explanation of the adjectives of *Jinamat*
that have come in the present text has been done in the discussion of the
original text. The name of the present sutra is *Jivajivaabhigam*, but mainly
because of the presentation of the *Jiva* or in brief, this sutra is known as
*Jivaabhigam*. 1. *Eyan Duwalasangam Ganipitagam Na Kayaavi Nasi, Na Kayaavi Na

---------------------------
Jain philosophy is primarily **ātmavādī** (soul-centric). The **jīva** (soul) is
its central point. Although the **janasiddhanta** (general principles) has
recognized nine **tattvas** (principles) or seven **tattvas** by including
**puṇya** (merit), **pāpa** (demerit) in **pāśrava** (bond), **bandha**
(attachment), all of them are just different states of the relationship or
separation of **jīva** and **ajīva** (non-soul) **karma-dravya** (matter of
action). The **ajīva** is presented to clearly explain the nature of the
**jīva** and to differentiate it from its different nature. **Puṇya**, **pāpa**,
**prādhava** (primordial), **sanvara** (purification), **nirjarā** (depletion),
**bandha**, and **mokṣa** (liberation) are the states that arise from the
combination and separation of **jīva** and **karma**. Therefore, it can be said
that the core of Jain philosophy is **ātmadravya** (soul-substance). Its
beginning is from **ātmavi-cāra** (reflection on the soul) and its final
culmination is **mokṣa**. This **sūtra** (text) discusses the **ātmadravya**,
i.e., the **jīva**, in detail. Therefore, it is called **jīvābhigama** (approach
to the soul). **Abhigama** means knowledge. **Jīvābhigama** is the knowledge of
**jīva** and **ajīva**. After generally mentioning the different aspects of
**ajīva**, the entire purpose of this **sūtra** is to focus on **jīvatattva**
(soul-principle). The **jīva** is divided into two categories: **siddh**
(liberated) and **saṃsārasamāpannaka** (bound to the cycle of existence).
Subsequently, the **sūtra** elaborates on nine **pratipattis** (perspectives)
regarding the different **vivaksās** (interpretations) of **saṃsārasamāpannaka**
souls. These nine **pratipattis** are presented from different perspectives,
therefore, despite being different, they are not contradictory and are factual.
This **jīva**, transformed by **rāgadveṣādi** (attachment, aversion, etc.)
**vibhāvapariṇatis** (transformations of the subtle body), experiences different
states, forms, births, deaths, etc. in the world, which are mentioned in these
nine **pratipattis**. It is described in detail how the **jīvātma** (soul)
experiences different states as **sthāvara** (immobile), as **strī-puruṣa**
(female-male), **napumsaka** (neuter), as **nārak** (hell being), **tiryanc**
(animal), **deva** (god), and **manuṣya** (human), as **ekendriya** (one-sensed)
to **pañcendriya** (five-sensed), as **pṛthvīkāya** (earth body) to **traskāya**
(subtle body), and in other forms from other perspectives. In the **dvividha**
(two-fold) **pratipatti**, after explaining the different categories of
**jīvas** as **sthāvara**, it describes them through 23 **dvāras** (gates): 1.
**śarīra** (body), 2. **avagāhanā** (perception), 3. **saṃhanana**
(aggregation), 4. **saṃsthāna** (structure), 5. **kaṣāya** (passions), 6.
**saṃjñā** (consciousness), 7. **leśyā** (subtle karmic tendencies), 8.
**indriya** (sense organs), 9. **samudghāta** (awakening), 10. **saṃjñī-
prasamjñī** (conscious-unconscious), 11. **veda** (knowledge), 12. **paryāpta-
aparyāpta** (sufficient-insufficient), 13. **dṛṣṭi** (vision), 14. **darśana**
(perception), 15. **jñāna** (knowledge), 16. **yoga** (concentration), 17.
**upayoga** (application), 18. **āhāra** (food), 19. **upapāta** (consequence),
20. **sthiti** (state), 21. **samavahata-asamavahata** (flowing-not flowing),
22. **cyavana** (decay), and 23. **gati-prāgati** (motion-progress). Similarly,
in the subsequent **pratipattis**, different **dvāras** are presented for
different categories of **jīvas**. The **dvāras** of **sthiti**, **saṃcitṭhaṇā**
(body state), **antara** (interval), and **alpabahutva** (less-more) are
mentioned as much as possible everywhere. In the final **pratipatti**, instead
of discussing the **vivaksās** of **siddh** and **saṃsārī** (worldly), it
presents the categories of all **jīvas**. This **sūtra** describes **adholoka**
(lower world), **tiryagloka** (animal world), and **ūrdhvaloka** (upper world)
in the context of **nārak**, **tiryanc**, **manuṣya**, and **deva**. In the
description of **tiryagloka**, it mentions **dvīpa-samudra** (islands-oceans),
**karmabhūmi-akarmabhūmi** (land of action-land of inaction), and provides a
detailed discussion of the geographical and cultural conditions there, which is
significant from various perspectives. Thus, this **sūtra** and its subject
matter provide detailed information about the **jīva**. Therefore, its name
**jīvābhigama** is meaningful. This **abhigama** is an important part of Jain
philosophy. The original source of this **sūtra** is a **granthan** (text) of
4750 (four thousand seven hundred fifty) **ślokas** (verses). **Ācārya
Malayagiri** wrote a **vṛtti** (commentary) of 14,000 (fourteen thousand)
**granthan** on it, revealing the essence of this profound **abhigama**. The
**vṛttikāra** (

The present edition of *Sampavana* is primarily based on the original text of
*Jivaabhigasutra* published by Seth Shri Devchand Lalbhai Pustakodhar Fund,
along with its commentary. However, there are differences between the original
text published in that edition and the text accepted by the commentator in many
places. This difference found in many places suggests that the commentator may
have had another copy (ideal) in front of him. Therefore, in many places, we
have given the commentator-approved text more acceptance in the original text.
Such textual variations have been mentioned in footnotes (notes) from place to
place. The commentator himself has mentioned that there are variations in the
sutra texts of this *Pragama* in many places. It is worth remembering that this
difference is about words, there is no difference in meaning. The difference is
not in the theoretical aspect, but in the descriptive places, the difference in
words and their order is visible. In such places, we have placed the
commentator-approved text in the original. The commentary of Acharya Shri
Malayagiri is also the main basis in the translation and discussion of the
present *Pragama*. We have tried our best to present the theoretical subject
matter of this theoretical *Pragama* in a clear manner before the inquisitive.
Therefore, we have given almost all the main points clarified in the commentary
in the discussion, so that inquisitive people who do not understand Sanskrit
language can also benefit from them. I believe that through this effort of mine,
Hindi-speaking inquisitive people will be able to understand all the theoretical
things that have been explained in the commentary in Sanskrit language. From
this point of view, the usefulness of this edition increases a lot. If the
inquisitive people will benefit from it, then I will consider my effort
meaningful. Finally, I consider myself blessed that I got the opportunity to
prepare the present *Agama*. I was entrusted with the responsibility of editing
the present *Jivaabhigasutra* on behalf of the *Pragama Prakashan Samiti*,
Byawar. Considering the seriousness of the *sutra*, I definitely felt hesitant
about my ability. But inspired by *Shruta Bhakti*, I accepted this
responsibility and got involved in its execution with dedication. Whatever I
could do, it is presented before the readers in this form. In my effort of
*Shruta Seva*, I have received guidance from the revered Guru Shri Pushkar
Muniji M., the Upadhyayashri of the *Shraman Sangh*, the renowned literary Guru
Shri Devendramuniji M., and the cooperation of Pandit Shri Rameshmuniji M., Shri
Surendramuniji, the learned Mahasati Dr. Shri Divyaprabhaji, Shri Anupamaji B.A.
etc., as a result of which I have been able to successfully complete this
arduous task. While editing the *Pragama*, I received the cooperation of Pandit
Shri Vasanti Lalji Nalvaya, Ratlam, which I cannot forget. If my effort will
benefit the inquisitive *Pragama* lovers, then I will consider my effort
meaningful. Finally, I wish that faith, belief and interest in the principles
formulated by Jinendra Dev will arise in the minds of every person, so that they
can become pilgrims of the path of liberation by worshipping the three jewels of
knowledge, vision and character. Shri Amar Jain Agama Bhandar - Rajendramuni

The description of the Salt Ocean in the third section of the text is as
follows: 154. The island named Jambudvipa is surrounded by the Salt Ocean, which
is completely enclosed by a circular wall.    O Venerable! Is the Salt Ocean
circular or non-circular?   It is circular, O Venerable!  O Venerable! What is
the diameter of the Salt Ocean and what is its circumference?  O Venerable! The
Salt Ocean has a diameter of two hundred thousand yojanas and a circumference of
fifteen hundred thousand yojanas, eighty-two thousand yojanas, one hundred
yojanas, and four yojanas, plus a little more.    It is surrounded on all sides
by a single mountain range called the Pumvaraveya, which is covered with a
forest of sandalwood trees. The Pumvaraveya mountain is half a yojana high, five
hundred dhanus wide, and has a circumference equal to that of the Salt Ocean.
The rest is the same.   The sandalwood forest extends for two yojanas and then
ends.   O Venerable! How many gates does the Salt Ocean have?  O Venerable! It
has four gates: Vijaya, Vejayante, Jayante, and Aparajita.  O Venerable! Where
is the gate named Vijaya located in the Salt Ocean?  O Venerable! The gate named
Vijaya is located in the Salt Ocean at the eastern end of the Dhayi-khanda, at
the eastern end of the southern part of the Dhayi-khanda, at the western end of
the Maha-nadi, and at the beginning of the Salt Ocean. It is eight yojanas high
and four yojanas wide. The rest is the same as the Vijaya gate of Jambudvipa,
which is located at the eastern end of the Rayahani.  O Venerable! Where is the
gate named Vejayante located in the Salt Ocean?  O Venerable! The gate named
Vejayante is located in the Salt Ocean at the southern end of the Dhayi-khanda,
at the southern end of the northern part of the Dhayi-khanda. The rest is the
same.  The same applies to the Jayante gate, which is located at the beginning
of the Navari-siya Maha-nadi.  The same applies to the Aparajita gate, which is
located at the beginning of the Gavara-disibhaga.  O Venerable! What is the
distance between the gates of the Salt Ocean?  O Venerable! The distance between
the gates is three hundred thousand yojanas, five hundred yojanas, and two
hundred yojanas, eighty yojanas. The distance between the gates of the Salt
Ocean is two hundred thousand yojanas. // 1 //  The distance between the gates
of the Salt Ocean is two hundred thousand yojanas. 1. The same applies to the
Vijaya gate. 2. Some manuscripts contain a complete description of all four
gates in the original text, but this has already been mentioned and is not
consistent with the commentary, so it has not been included here.

## The Third Rebirth: The Description of the Salt Ocean  One should know that
the **Salt Ocean** is located above the **Shiita Mahanadi**. Similarly, one
should know about **Aparajitadwar**. Its characteristic is that it is located at
the northern end of the **Salt Ocean**, and its southern part is in the
**Dhataki Khand**. Its capital is in another **Salt Ocean**, after crossing
countless islands in the sea, north of **Aparajitadwar**. Oh Bhagwan! What is
the distance between these doors of the **Salt Ocean**? Gautam! The distance
between each door is **395,280 yojanas and one kos**. Oh Bhagwan! Are the
regions of the **Dhataki Khand** touching the **Salt Ocean**? Yes, Gautam! They
are touching, and all the descriptions should be the same as those given for
**Jambu Dweep**. The regions of the **Dhataki Khand** are in contact with the
**Salt Ocean**, and all the statements should be known as before. Do beings born
in the **Salt Ocean** die and are reborn in the **Dhataki Khand**? All the
statements should be known as before. The same should be said about beings born
in the **Dhataki Khand** dying and being reborn in the **Salt Ocean**. Oh
Bhagwan! Why is the **Salt Ocean** called the **Salt Ocean**? Gautam! The water
of the **Salt Ocean** is impure, muddy, salty, **lindr** (having a taste like
cow dung), brackish, bitter, and undrinkable for bipeds, quadrupeds, deer,
animals, birds, and reptiles. It is only drinkable for creatures born in the
**Salt Ocean** (because they are born there, they consume it). The ruler of the
**Salt Ocean** is a god named **Susthit**, who is very powerful and has the
status of **Palyopam**. He rules over his own family, including his **Samanik**
gods, the capital of **Susthita** in the **Salt Ocean**, and many other gods and
goddesses who reside there. Therefore, Gautam, the **Salt Ocean** is called the
**Salt Ocean**. Another point, Gautam, is that the name "**Salt Ocean**" is
eternal and permanent. (Therefore, this name is **animittik**.) - 155. In the
**Salt Ocean**, Bhagwan! How many moons were shining, are shining, and will
shine? This question should be understood to include all five celestial bodies,
including the moon. Gautam! In the **Salt Ocean**, four moons were shining, are
shining, and will shine. Four suns were shining, are shining, and will shine.
One hundred and twelve constellations were making conjunctions with the moon,
are making conjunctions, and will make conjunctions. 1. The width of each door
is four yojanas. Each door has two branches, each one kos thick. The total width
of one door is four and a half yojanas. The total width of all four doors is 18
yojanas. The circumference of the **Salt Ocean** is 18 yojanas less, and
dividing it by four gives the above measure.

"There were, are, and will be three hundred and fifty-two Mahagrahas (great
planets) moving. Two hundred sixty-seven thousand nine hundred Koḍakoḍī
(trillions) stars were, are, and will be shining.  The reason for the increase
in water: 156. "Kamma ṇam bhanta! Does the salt ocean increase or decrease
during the fourteen-day full moon?" "Go-yama! Outside the Jambudvipa island, in
the four directions, the salt ocean is spread for twenty-five thousand yojanas.
There are four great Mahapaatala (great underground regions) established,
namely: Valayamukhe, Ketue, Juve, Isare. These great Mahapaatala are one hundred
thousand yojanas in height, ten thousand yojanas in diameter at the base, one
hundred thousand yojanas in diameter in the middle, and ten thousand yojanas in
diameter at the mouth. These great Mahapaatala have a circumference of ten
hundred thousand yojanas, all made of white, fine sand. There are many living
beings who are born, grow, decay, and die. These sands are destroyed by the wind
and rain. There are four gods who reside there, namely: Kale, Maha-kale,
Velambe, Pabhanjane. These great Mahapaatala are divided into three parts,
namely: the lower part, the middle part, and the upper part. These three parts
are thirty-three thousand yojanas in length, thirty-three hundred yojanas in
width, and one yojana in height. In the lower part, there are only winds. In the
middle part, there are both winds and clouds. In the upper part, there are only
clouds.  Furthermore, Go-yama! In the salt ocean, there are many small
underground regions called Khuddapataala (small underground regions). These
small Mahapaatala are one thousand yojanas in height, one hundred yojanas in

## Third Section: The Cause of Water Increase  They say that these great oceans
are divided into three parts, namely, the lower part, the middle part, and the
upper part. These three parts are each thirty-three thousand three hundred
thirty-three yojanas and one-third yojana (333333) in thickness.  In the lower
part, there is only air. In the middle part, there is both air and water. In the
upper part, there is only water.  Similarly, in the salt ocean, there are seven
thousand eight hundred and eighty-four yojanas of water surrounding the earth.
Now, in the lower and middle parts of these great oceans and small oceans, many
winds arise, they gather, they rise, they move, they shake, they roar, they
thunder, they roar, they change their state. Due to this, the water level rises.
But when in the lower and middle parts of these great oceans and small oceans,
many winds do not arise, and they do not change their state, then the water
level does not rise.  Similarly, if the winds rise, the water level rises. If
the winds do not rise, the water level does not rise.  Thus, O Gautama! In the
salt ocean, the water level increases and decreases on the fourteenth, eighth,
new moon, and full moon days.  ## Explanation of the Cause  O Bhagavan! What is
the reason for the water level of the salt ocean increasing and decreasing on
the fourteenth, eighth, new moon, and full moon days?  O Gautama! In the four
directions of the Jambudvipa island, beyond the outer Vedicant, at a distance of
ninety-five thousand yojanas in the salt ocean, there are four very large
Mahapatala Kalashas, shaped like a great pitcher. Their names are Valayamukha,
Keyupa, Yupa, and Ishvara.  These Patala Kalashas are one hundred thousand
yojanas deep in the water. Their diameter at the base is ten thousand yojanas.
From there, they gradually widen, reaching a width of one hundred thousand
yojanas in the middle. Then, they gradually narrow again, reaching a width of
ten thousand yojanas at the mouth.  The walls of these Patala Kalashas are
uniform throughout. They are all one thousand yojanas thick. They are entirely
made of vajra-ratna (diamond), as clear as the sky and crystal, and are
perfectly symmetrical.  Within these walls, many living beings are born and die.
Many pudgalas (matter particles) gather and disperse. There is a constant cycle
of creation and destruction of pudgalas.  These walls are eternal according to
the Dravyarthik Nay (principle of substance), and they are imperishable
according to the Paryaya Nay (principle of modification).  In these Patala
Kalashas, there reside four great Dikpala Devas (guardian deities) who are in
the state of Palyopama (supreme bliss). Their names are Kal, Mahakal, Velamb,
and Prabhanjan.  These Mahapatala Kalashas are divided into three parts: 1. The
lower part, 2. The middle part, and 3. The upper part. Each of these parts is
thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three yojanas and one-third yojana
(333333) thick.  In the lower part, there is only air. In the middle part, there
is both air and water. In the upper part, there is only water.  The water level
of the salt ocean increases and decreases due to the winds arising in the lower
and middle parts of these Mahapatala Kalashas. When the winds arise, they push
the water upwards, causing the water level to rise. When the winds do not arise,
the water level remains stable.  This is the reason why the water level of the
salt ocean increases and decreases on the fourteenth, eighth, new moon, and full
moon days.

The **Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra** states that the **Vayu-Kaya** and **Ap-Kaya** are
present in the lower and middle sections of the **Maha-Patala-Kalasha**, while
only **Ap-Kaya** is present in the upper section. Additionally, O Gautam! within
the **Lavana-Samudra** (salt ocean), amidst these **Maha-Patala-Kalasha**, there
are numerous smaller **Patala-Kalasha** resembling small pots. These smaller
**Patala-Kalasha** are each a thousand **Yojan** deep, a hundred **Yojan** wide
at their base, and expand to a thousand **Yojan** wide at their middle,
increasing in size by one **Pradesh** at a time. They then decrease in size by
one **Pradesh** at a time, reaching a hundred **Yojan** wide at their mouth.
The walls of these smaller **Patala-Kalasha** are uniform, ten **Yojan** thick,
entirely made of **Vajra** (diamond), and are pure and transparent. Many
**Jivas** (living beings) are born and emerge within them, and many **Pudgala**
(matter particles) accumulate and disperse, undergoing constant **Chaya-
Apachaya** (creation and destruction). These walls are eternal according to the
**Dravya-Athi-Nay** (theory of substance), but impermanent according to the
**Varna-Adi-Paryaya** (theory of categories).  Each of these smaller **Patala-
Kalasha** is inhabited by **Devas** (divine beings) in the state of **Ardha-
Palyopam** (half-lotus). These smaller **Patala-Kalasha** are divided into three
sections: 1. Lower Tri-Bhag, 2. Middle Tri-Bhag, and 3. Upper Tri-Bhag. These
three sections are each three hundred thirty-three **Yojan** and one-third
**Yojan** (3333) thick. The **Vayu-Kaya** is present in the lower Tri-Bhag, both
**Vayu-Kaya** and **Ap-Kaya** are present in the middle Tri-Bhag, and only **Ap-
Kaya** is present in the upper Tri-Bhag.  Thus, in total, there are seven
thousand eight hundred eighty-four (7884) **Patala-Kalasha** in the **Lavana-
Samudra**, including both the **Maha-Patala** and **Kshudra-Patala** (large and
small **Patala-Kalasha**).  In the lower and middle sections of these **Maha-
Patala** and **Kshudra-Patala** **Kalasha**, many **Vayu-Kaya** with **Urdhva-
Gaman** (ascending) nature or strong power are born. They attain **Pratma-Labh**
(liberation) through **Samurchana-Janma** (birth from a state of complete
immersion), tremble, tremble intensely, move forcefully, rub against each other,
and spread out powerfully in all directions. As they transform into different
states, the ocean water is agitated and thrown upwards by them.  When these
**Vayu-Kaya** with strong power are not born in the lower and middle sections of
the **Maha-Patala** and **Kshudra-Patala** **Kalasha**, or when they do not
transform into those states, the water does not rise. Twice a day (at regular
intervals) and on the fourteenth and other lunar days (due to the nature of the
universe), the water of the **Lavana-Samudra** is agitated and rises
particularly high due to these **Vayu-Kaya**. It does not rise at other times,
except at regular intervals.  Therefore, O Gautam! the water of the **Lavana-
Samudra** rises on the fourteenth, eighth, and new moon days (as stated in the
**Sangrahni-Gatha**).

## Third Chapter: The Statement of the Salt Crest  **157.**  "O Bhagavan! How
many times does the salt ocean rise and fall in thirty muhurtas (a day and
night)?"  "O Gautama! The salt ocean rises and falls twice in thirty muhurtas (a
day and night)."  "O Bhagavan! Why is it said that the salt ocean rises and
falls twice in thirty muhurtas?"  "O Gautama! When the air is agitated, the
water rises from the lower and middle compartments of the Patala Kalasas
(underground reservoirs) and the ocean rises. When the air is still, the Patala
Kalasas are filled with water and the ocean falls. Therefore, O Gautama! It is
said that the salt ocean rises and falls twice in thirty muhurtas."  **158.** "O
Bhagavan! How wide is the salt crest in relation to the circumference of the
Chakravala (the universe) and how much does it rise and fall?"  "O Gautama! The
salt crest rises and falls by half a yojana (a measure of distance) in relation
to the circumference of the Chakravala, which is ten thousand yojanas."  "O
Bhagavan! How many Gagasahasras (a measure of depth) does the salt ocean hold in
its inner circumference? How many Nagasahasras does it hold in its outer
circumference? How many Nagasahasras does it hold in its sunrise circumference?"
"O Gautama! The salt ocean holds forty-two Gagasahasras in its inner
circumference, forty-two Gagasahasras in its outer circumference, and sixty
Nagasahasras in its sunrise circumference. Thus, with its coverings, it is one
Nagasahasra and one Gagasahasra."

[10] Gautama! The crest of the salt ocean is ten thousand yojanas wide, compared
to the circumference of the chakravala, and it rises and falls by a little less
than half a yojana. O Bhagavan! How many thousand Naga Kumar Devas hold the
inner rim of the salt ocean? How many thousand Naga Kumar Devas hold the outer
rim? How many thousand Naga Kumar Devas hold the agrodaka? Gautama! Forty-two
thousand Naga Kumar Devas hold the inner rim of the salt ocean / Seventy-two
thousand Naga Kumar Devas hold the outer rim / Sixty thousand Naga Kumar Devas
hold the agrodaka / Thus, the total number of these Naga Kumaras is said to be
one hundred and seventy-four thousand. Discussion - The crest of the salt ocean
is equal in all directions to the circumference of the chakravala and is ten
thousand yojanas in circumference. That crest rises and falls by a little less
than half a yojana (two kosas). This is clear as follows: In the salt ocean,
there is a gotirtha from Jambudvipa and from Dhaatki-khandadvipa up to ninety-
five thousand yojanas. Gotirtha means the land that gradually slopes downwards,
entering into ponds, etc. / The middle part is ten thousand yojanas deep. Near
the vedika of Jambudvipa and near the vedika of Dhaatki-khandadvipa, the
gotirtha is an immeasurable part of an angula. From there onwards, one should
understand that the land gradually slopes downwards from the flat land, until a
distance of ninety-five thousand yojanas is reached / There is a depth of one
thousand yojanas up to a distance of ninety-five thousand yojanas, compared to
the flat land / Therefore, near the Jambudvipa vedika and the Dhaatki-
khandadvipa vedika, there is an increase in water in that flat land, which is an
immeasurable part of an angula. From there onwards, one should understand that
the increase in water gradually increases with the increase in land, until a
distance of ninety-five thousand yojanas is reached on both sides. Here, there
is an increase in water of seven hundred yojanas compared to the flat land /
That is, there is a depth of one thousand yojanas from the flat land and an
increase in water of seven hundred yojanas above it. From there onwards, in the
middle part, there is a depth of one thousand yojanas in a width of ten thousand
yojanas and an increase in water of sixteen thousand yojanas. When the air in
the Patala-kalasha is disturbed, there is an increase in water above it by a
little less than two kosas in a day and night, twice. When the air in the
Patala-kalasha is calm, there is no increase in water / This is what is said in
these verses: Pancaanauyasahaasse gotittan ubhayano vi lavanassa / Joyanasayaani

Third Pratipatti: The Proclamation of Lavanaśikhā  [11] The forty-two thousand
Nāgakumāra devas who come under the Bhavanapatinikāya are those who prevent the
advancing wave, i.e., the crest that is moving towards the Jambūdvīpa, from the
inner shore of the Lavaṇasamudra.  Similarly, the seventy-two thousand
Nāgakumāra devas are those who prevent the advancing crest and its excessive
growth that is moving towards the Dhātakīkhaṇḍa, which is the outer shore of the
Lavaṇasamudra.  The sixty thousand Mārukumāra devas are those who prevent the
water (of the Lavaṇasamudra) from rising above the Deśonapardhayojana.  These
Nāgakumāra devas maintain the shores of the Lavaṇasamudra within their limits.
The total number of these Velaṃdhara Nāgakumāras is one lakh seventy-four
thousand.  159. (a) - Bhante! How many types of Velaṃdhara Nāgarājas are there?
Gautama! There are four types of Velaṃdhara Nāgarājas, namely - Gothūbha, Sivae,
Saṃkhe, and Maṇosilae.  Bhante! How many residential provinces (āvāsapabbhaya)
are there for these four Velaṃdhara Nāgarājas? Gautama! There are four
residential provinces, namely - Gothūbha, Udagabhāse, Saṃkhe, and Dagasīmāe.
Bhante! In which residential province is the Gothūbha Velaṃdhara Nāgarāja's
Gothūbha named? Gautama! In the Jambūdvīpa island, the Gothūbha residential
province of the Gothūbha Velaṃdhara Nāgarāja is situated, extending seventeen
hundred and twenty-one yojanas upwards in height, four hundred yojanas in width
at the base, and twenty-seven yojanas in width at the middle, with a
circumference of three thousand and thirty-two yojanas at the base and two
thousand and sixty-six yojanas at the middle. It is entirely made of gold,
beautiful and splendid.  It is surrounded on all sides by a magnificent lotus
lake and a forest. Both are of the same color. In the middle part of the
Gothūbha residential province, there is a vast and delightful land area where
the devas reside. In the center of this delightful land, there is a magnificent
palace, eighty yojanas in height and of the same measurement in width and
length, entirely made of gold, beautiful and splendid, along with its
surroundings.  Bhante! Why is it called the Gothūbha residential province?
Gautama! In the Gothūbha residential province, there are many small and large
lotus flowers of the Gothūbha variety, and the devas who reside there are also
called Gothūbha. Therefore, it is called the Gothūbha residential province.  The
Rājahāṇī (the chief queen) of the Gothūbha residential province of the Gothūbha
Velaṃdhara Nāgarāja resides there eternally. The Rājahāṇī is situated in the
eastern part of the Lavaṇasamudra, across an uncountable number of islands, and
in another Lavaṇasamudra, with the same measurements as described earlier.

thousand Samanik Devas, etc., the Gostup Avasaparbata and the Gostupa Rajdhani.
For this reason, it is called Gostup Avasaparbata. It is eternal (in substance)
/ Therefore, this name has been in use since time immemorial. O Bhagavan! Where
is the Gostupa Rajdhani of the Gostup Deva? O Gautama! The Gostupa Rajdhani is
in another Lavanasamudra, after crossing countless islands and seas in the
Tiryadiksha, east of the Gostup Avasaparbata / Its description should be known
like that of the Vijaya Rajdhani / Bhanta! Where is the Avasaparbata of the

14) O Bhagavan! Where is the abode-mountain called Shankha of the Velandhara
Nagaraja named Shankha? Gautama! Forty-two thousand yojanas west of Mount Meru
in Jambudvipa is the abode-mountain called Shankha of the Velandhara Nagaraja
named Shankha. Its characteristics are like those of a Go-stupa. Its special
feature is that it is entirely made of jewels, pure. It is surrounded by a
lotus-shaped platform and a forest. Why is it called the abode-mountain called
Shankha? Gautama! On that abode-mountain called Shankha, there are small wells,
etc., in which there are many lotuses, etc. They are of the color of Shankha, of
the nature of Shankha, and have the qualities of Shankha. There resides a
Mahddhika Deva named Shankha. He wanders around, ruling over the capital city
called Shankha. The capital city called Shankha is to the west of the abode-
mountain called Shankha. The characteristics, etc., should be described like
those of the capital city called Vijaya. O Bhagavan! Where is the abode-mountain
called Dakasima of the Velandhara Nagaraja named Manahshilaka? O Gautama! Forty-
two thousand yojanas ahead in the salt sea, in the north direction of Mount Meru
in Jambudvipa, is the abode-mountain called Dakasima of the Velandhara Nagaraja
named Manahshilaka. Its characteristics, etc., should be described as before.
Its special feature is that it is entirely made of crystal jewels, pure. Why is
it called Dakasima? Gautama! From this abode-mountain called Dakasima, the great
rivers called Shita-Shito-da flow and are obstructed here - they turn back.
Therefore, because it is the boundary of water, it is called "Dakasima". It is
eternal (nitya), therefore, this name is also animittaka. There resides a
Mahddhika Deva named Manahshilaka. He wanders around, ruling over four thousand
Samanika Devas, etc. O Bhagavan! Where is the capital city called Manahshila of
the Velandhara Nagaraja named Manahshilaka? Gautama! In the salt sea, in the
north direction of the abode-mountain called Dakasima, after crossing countless
islands and seas in a diagonal direction, is the capital city called Manahshila.
Its characteristics, etc., should be described like those of the capital city
called Vijaya. There resides a Mahddhika Deva named Manahshilaka, who is in the
state of a Palyopama. The abode-mountains of the Velandhara Nagarajas are
respectively made of gold, Anka-ratna, silver, and crystal. The mountains of the
Anuve-landhara Nagarajas are all made of jewels. 160. O Bhante! What are the
names of the Anuve-landhara Nagarajas? Gotama! There are four Anuve-landhara
Nagarajas, namely Kakkodae, Kaddamae, Kelaase, and Arunap-bhae. O Bhante! How
many abode-mountains are there for these four Anuve-landhara Nagarajas? Gotama!
There are four abode-mountains, namely Kakkodae, Kaddamae, Kelaase, and Arunap-
bhae. O Bhante! Where is the abode-mountain called Kakkodae of the Anuve-
landhara Nagaraja called Kakkodae? Gotama! In Jambudvipa, forty-two thousand
yojanas ahead in the salt sea, in the north-west direction of Mount Mandara, is
the abode-mountain called Kakkodae of the Nagaraja called Kakkodae. Its
characteristics are like those of a Go-stupa. It is entirely made of jewels,
pure. It is surrounded by a lotus-shaped platform and a forest. Why is it called
the abode-mountain called Kakkodae? Gautama! On that abode-mountain called
Kakkodae, there are small wells, etc., in which there are many lotuses, etc.

qualities of Kakkodae. There resides a Mahddhika Deva named Kakkodae. He wanders
around, ruling over the capital city called Kakkodae. The capital city called

## Third Chapter: The Description of Lavanasikha  [15]  "The journey of 15
Kadamas is not well-defined. However, the residence of the king of the Nagas,
Lavanasikha, is located in the southeast direction, while the residence of the
king of the Nagas, Rayahani, is located in the northeast direction.  /
Similarly, the residence of the king of the Nagas, Kailasa, is located in the
southwest direction, while the residence of the king of the Nagas, Rayahani, is
located in the southeast direction.  /  The residence of the king of the Nagas,
Arunaprabha, is located in the northwest direction, while the residence of the
king of the Nagas, Rayahani, is located in the southeast direction.  /  All four
are of equal measure and are made entirely of jewels.   [160]  "O Bhagavan! How
many Anuve-landhar Nagarajas (kings of the Nagas who follow the orders of
Velandhar) are there?  /  Gautam! There are four Anuve-landhar Nagarajas, their
names are - Karkotaka, Kardama, Kailasa, and Arunaprabha.  /  O Bhagavan! How
many Avasa-parvata (residences) do these four Anuve-landhar Nagarajas have?  /
Gautam! There are four Avasa-parvata, namely - Karkotaka, Kardama, Kailasa, and
Arunaprabha.  /  O Bhagavan! Where is the Avasa-parvata named Karkotaka,
belonging to the Anuve-landhar Nagaraja Karkotaka?  /  Gautam! In the
Jambudvipa, 42,000 yojanas ahead in the Lavanasamudra, in the northeast
direction of the Meru Parvata (Mount Meru), is the Avasa-parvata named
Karkotaka, belonging to the Nagaraja Karkotaka, which is 1721 yojanas high. The
same description should be applied to the Go-stupa Parvata.  /  The special
feature is that it is entirely made of jewels, it is pure, and all the details,
including the throne and its surroundings, should be described as before.  /
The reason for naming it Karkotaka is that the lotuses and other flowers in the
wells and other places here are of the same shape and color as the Karkotaka.  /
The rest should be described as before.  /  The capital city of Karkotaka is
located in the Lavanasamudra, beyond countless islands and seas, in the
northeast direction of the Karkotaka Parvata. The measure and other details are
the same as before.  [1]  "The complete description of the Avasa-parvata named
Kardama is the same as before. The special feature is that it is located in the
Lavanasamudra, 42,000 yojanas ahead in the southeast direction of the Meru
Parvata.  /  Its capital city is Vidyu-tprabha, which is located in the
Lavanasamudra, beyond countless islands and seas, in the southeast direction of
this Avasa-parvata. The description should be understood as the same as the
capital city of Vijaya.  /  The complete description of the Avasa-parvata named
Kailasa is the same as before. The special feature is that it is located in the
southwest direction of the Meru Parvata.  /  Its capital city is Kailasa, which
is located in the Lavanasamudra, beyond countless islands and seas, in the
southwest direction of the Kailasa Parvata.  /  The Avasa-parvata named
Arunaprabha is located in the northwest direction of the Meru Parvata.  /  Its
capital city is also located in the Lavanasamudra, beyond countless islands and
seas, in the northwest direction of the Arunaprabha Avasa-parvata. The rest of
the description is the same as the capital city of Vijaya.  /  All four Avasa-
parvata are of equal measure and are entirely made of jewels.  [1]  "The deity
of the Kardama Avasa-parvata is naturally Yaksha-kardamapriya. Yaksha-kardama
means a fragrant substance made by mixing saffron, agarwood, camphor, musk,
sandalwood, etc.  /  The first part of the word is omitted, hence it is called
Kardama."

## Third Chapter: Description of the Moon Islands in Jambudvipa  [17] In
Jambudvipa, there is a vast, earthly pleasure garden called Atikridaavas,
belonging to the Lord of Salt, Susthita Deva. It is sixty-two and a half yojanas
high and one hundred and twenty-five yojanas wide, supported by hundreds of
pillars. The description of the main building should be mentioned. In this
Atikridaavas pleasure garden, there is a very beautiful land, the description of
which should be given, starting with the touch of jewels. In the exact middle of
this beautiful land, there is a jewel platform. This jewel platform is two
yojanas long and wide, one yojana high, and entirely made of jewels. It is pure
and perfect. On top of this jewel platform, there is a divine bed. Its
description should be known as before.  O Bhagavan! Why is Gautamdvipa called
Gautamdvipa? Gautam! In Gautamdvipa, there are many lotuses and lilies, which
have the shape and radiance of a Gautama (Gomaedaratna) jewel. Therefore, it is
called Gautamdvipa. This Gautamdvipa is eternal in terms of its substance.
Therefore, its name is also eternal and without any cause.  O Bhagavan! Where is
the capital city of Susthita Deva, the Lord of Salt, called Susthita? Gautam! In
the west of Gautamdvipa, after crossing countless islands and seas diagonally,
there is the capital city Susthita in another salt sea. It is found twelve
thousand yojanas further in the other salt sea. All the details should be known
like the description of the capital city of Gostupa, until the great Deva
Susthita is found there.  ## Description of the Moon Islands in Jambudvipa 162
Tell me, Venerable One! What is the name of the Moon Island among the Moon
Islands in Jambudvipa? Gotama! In Jambudvipa, twelve thousand yojanas east of
the Mandara Mountain, in the salt sea, there is the Moon Island, called
Chandadvipa. It is forty-nine and a half yojanas wide from the edge of
Jambudvipa, and the water is five and a half yojanas deep. The water is two
kosas deep in the salt sea. It is twelve thousand yojanas in length and breadth,
and its description is like that of Gotamadvipa.  The leaves of the
Paumavaraveiya trees are covered with forests, and they are of two colors. There
are many beautiful lands, until the gods reside there. In the middle of these
beautiful lands, there are jewel platforms, two yojanas wide, and the thrones
with their families should be described in the same way.  Gotama! In many small
and large caves, there are many lotuses, which have the color of the moon. The
gods reside there, until the second transformation of the Paliyovam.  There, in
each forest, there are four thousand yojanas, until the Moon Islands, and the
kings of the Moon Islands.

18] [Jivajiva-migam-sutra] In this, many Jyotishka Devas and Devis are said to
reside.  How far does this extend?  Gotama!  It extends as far as the
Chandradvipas.  How far are the Chandradvipas from Jambudvipa?  Gotama!  From
the eastern side of Jambudvipa, going straight across, twelve thousand yojanas
away, are the two Chandradvipas.  Their size is the same as the Chandras, the
great Devas.  How far is the Suradipa from Jambudvipa?  Gotama!  From the
eastern side of the Mandara mountain, twelve thousand yojanas away, is the
Suradipa.  Its height, length, and breadth are to be known as the same as the
Vanasando, the landmass, and the Asaya.  Its size is the same as the Mani-
pedhika, the throne, and the family of the eight Ushpalas, the Sura-Prabhais,
the Suras, the Devas, and the Chandradvipas.  From the western side of the
Suradipa, twelve thousand yojanas away, is the Suradipa.  This is the extent of
the Sura Devas.  162.  O Bhagavan!  Where are the two Chandradvipas of the two
Chandramas of Jambudvipa?  Gotama!  From the eastern side of the Meru mountain,
twelve thousand yojanas away, are the two Chandradvipas of the two Chandramas of
Jambudvipa.  These islands are 88 1/2 yojanas high above Jambudvipa and two
yojanas high above the salt ocean.  They are twelve thousand yojanas long and
wide.  The rest of the circumference, etc., should be known as the same as the
Gautamadipa.  They are surrounded by lotus-like platforms and forests.  Both
should be described.  In those islands, there are many beautiful landmasses
where many Jyotishka Devas rise and sit.  In those beautiful landmasses, there
are palaces, which are 62 1/2 yojanas high.  The rest of the description should
be known as the same as the Gautamadipa.  In the middle, there are Mani-
pedhikas, which are two yojanas long and wide and one yojana thick.  The rest,
including the throne and family, should be described as before.  O Bhagavan!
Why are these called Chandradvipas?  Gotama!  In those islands, there are many
small ponds, etc., with many lotuses, etc., which are like the moon in nature
and radiance.  There, the great Devas called Chandra, who are in the state of
Palyopama, reside.  They rule over four thousand Samanika Devas, the
Chandradvipas, the Chandra capitals, and many other Jyotishka Devas and Devis,
experiencing the results of their virtuous deeds.  Therefore, Gotama, they are
called Chandradvipas.  Gotama!  These Chandradvipas are eternal in terms of
substance, and therefore their names are also eternal.  O Bhagavan!  Where are
the Chandra capitals of the Chandras of Jambudvipa?  Gotama!  From the eastern
side of the Chandradvipas, going straight across, countless islands and oceans,
twelve thousand yojanas away, are these capitals.  Their size, etc., should be
known as the same as the Gautamadi, etc., capitals.  There, the great Devas
called Chandra reside.

[19 Third Exposition: Description of the Chandradwipas located in Jambudwipa]  O
Bhagavan! Where are the two Suryadwipas of the two Suns of Jambudwipa? Gautama!
To the west of the Meru mountain of Jambudwipa, in the Lavaṇa ocean, at a
distance of twelve thousand yojanas, are the two Suryadwipas of the two Suns of
Jambudwipa. Their height, length, breadth, circumference, forests, land
divisions, the movement of the deities, palaces, their dimensions, jeweled
pedestals, and thrones with entourage, should be described similar to the
Chandradwipa.  O Bhagavan! Why are they called Suryadwipas? Gautama! In the
ponds and other water bodies of those islands, there are numerous lotus flowers
and other aquatic plants that are similar in color and form to the Sun, hence
they are called Suryadwipas. These Suryadwipas are eternal in terms of
substance. Therefore, their name is also eternal. The Sun god, Samanika deities,
and other luminous deities reside and wander in these, up to their capital
cities which are located twelve thousand yojanas further west of other
Jambudwipa, after crossing innumerable island-oceans to the west of their own
islands. Their dimensions and other details should be understood similar to the
aforementioned capitals of Chandradwipa and others.

Third Pratipatti: Description of the Chandradwipas in the Kalodadhi Ocean  The
Chandradwipas of the Chandras of the Dhatakirhanda Dwipa are located as follows:
From the eastern boundary of the Dhatakirhanda Dwipa, proceeding 12,000 yojanas
into the Kalodadhi Ocean, are the Chandradwipas of the Chandras of the
Dhatakirhanda Dwipa. (There are 12 Chandras in the Dhatakirhanda Dwipa.) They
are elevated two kosas above the water all around. They are 12,000 yojanas in
length and breadth. Their circumference, landmass, pavilions, jeweled pedestals,
thrones with entourage, names, and capital cities are to be known as before. The
capital cities of these Chandras are in the eastern direction in other
Dhatakirhanda Dwipas from their own islands. The rest is as before.  Similarly,
one should describe the Suryadwipas of the Dhatakirhanda Dwipa. The specialty is
that proceeding 12,000 yojanas from the western boundary of the Dhatakirhanda
Dwipa into the Kalodadhi Ocean, one reaches these islands. The capital cities of
these Suras are in the west of the Suryadwipas, beyond countless island-oceans,
in other Dhatakirhanda Dwipas, and the rest is to be known as before.  165.
Lord, where are the Chandradwipas of the Chandras in the Kalodadhi Ocean?
Gautama, from the eastern boundary of the Kalodadhi Ocean, proceeding 12,000
yojanas westward, are the Chandradwipas of the Chandras in the Kalodadhi Ocean.
They are elevated two kosas above the water all around. The rest is to be stated
as before, up to the capital cities being in other Kalodadhi Oceans, 12,000
yojanas away in the west of their own islands, and so on.

Agghas, Khannas, Sihas, and Vijati, these aquatic creatures like fish and
turtles in the Salt Ocean, are there also these in the oceans outside the two
and a half islands?" "No, Gautama, they are not there." [169] "Bhagavan, is the
Salt Ocean salty, rocky, turbulent, or calm?" "Gautama, the Salt Ocean is salty,
not rocky, turbulent, not calm." "Are the oceans outside the two and a half
islands salty, rocky, turbulent, or calm?" "Gautama, the oceans outside the two
and a half islands are not salty, not rocky, not turbulent, not calm, but they
are full, completely filled, and remain stable with equal density." "Bhagavan,
are there many whirlpools and currents in the Salt Ocean that pull things in,
push things out, or cause things to sink?" "Yes, Gautama! Just as there are many
whirlpools and currents in the Salt Ocean that pull things in, push things out,
or cause things to sink, are there also these in the oceans outside the two and
a half islands?" "No, Gautama, they are not there."  [1] The author of the Mula-
tika also says, "Thus, the islands of the Moon and Sun in the remaining islands
are to be found in the immediate oceans. Their capitals are located in the east
and west, after traversing countless islands and oceans, and then in the second
island with a similar name. After leaving the last five islands, they are
located in the self-created oceans of the Devas, Nagas, Yakshas, and Bhutas. The
capitals of the Moon and Sun are not in another island, but in their own, after
traversing countless thousands of yojanas from the edge of the Vedika, in the
east and west." There are many variations in the text of these sutras, but the
meaning is the same everywhere. This is according to the explanation, and all
should follow it, not be confused. [2] The author of the Churnika says, "Agghas,
Khannas, Sihas, and Vijati are aquatic creatures like fish and turtles."

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):  O Venerable One! Thus it is said -
Are the external oceans full, of full measure, overflowing, and standing in an
even manner? Gautama! In the external oceans, there are many aquatic jivas and
pudgalas that move, go away, come, and accumulate due to the nature of water.
That is why it is said that the external oceans are full, of full measure,
overflowing, and standing in an even manner.  O Venerable One! Is the water of
the saline ocean surging or steady, i.e., uniformly calm? Is it agitated or
unagitated? Gautama! The water of the saline ocean is surging, not steady,
agitated, not unagitated. O Venerable One! Just as the water of the saline ocean
is surging, not steady, agitated, not unagitated, are the external oceans also
surging waters or steady waters, agitated waters or unagitated waters? Gautama!
The external oceans are not surging waters, they are steady waters, not agitated
waters, they are unagitated waters. They are full, completely filled, as if
wanting to overflow, especially wanting to overflow, they are filled to the brim
like a full pot.  O Venerable One! In the saline ocean, are there many large
clouds that are born, produced, or do they rain? Yes, Gautama! There are clouds
there, and they rain.  O Venerable One! Just as in the saline ocean, many large
clouds are born and rain, are there also many clouds born and raining in the
external oceans? O Gautama! That is not the case. O Venerable One! Why is it
said that the external oceans are full, completely filled, as if wanting to
overflow, especially wanting to overflow, and are filled to the brim like a full
pot? O Gautama! In the external oceans, many aquatic jivas come and go, and many
pudgalas accumulate in the form of water, especially accumulate, and therefore
it is said that the external oceans are full, completely filled, up to being
filled to the brim like a full pot.  O Venerable One! What is the measure of the
rise and fall of the saline ocean? Gautama! The rise and fall of the saline
ocean is measured as five-and-a-half yojanas. The rise and fall of the waves is
measured as five-and-a-half cubits. The rise and fall of the ripples is measured
as five-and-a-half aṅgulas.

## Third Chapter: Special Features of Devadvipa etc. [27]  **Question:**  O
Bhagavan! How does the depth of the salt ocean increase? In other words, how
much does the depth increase for every distance travelled?  **Answer:**  O
Gautama! The depth of the salt ocean increases by one *prastha* (a unit of
measurement) for every 95 *prasthas* travelled from both sides (from the edge of
Jambudvipa and from the edge of the salt ocean). Similarly, the depth increases
by one *balagra* (hair tip) for every 95 *balagras* travelled, by one *likkha*
(a unit of measurement) for every 95 *likkhas*, by one *yavamdhya* (middle of a
barley grain) for every 95 *yavamdhyas*, and so on. The same applies for
*angula* (finger), *vitasti* (span), *rasni* (hand), *kukshi* (belly), *dhanush*
(bow), *kośa* (a unit of measurement), *yojana* (a unit of measurement),
*hundred yojanas*, and *thousand yojanas*.  **Question:**  O Bhagavan! How does
the height of the salt ocean increase? In other words, how much does the height
increase for every distance travelled?  **Answer:**  O Gautama! The height of
the salt ocean increases by sixteen *prasthas* for every 95 *prasthas* travelled
from both sides.  **Answer:**  O Gautama! This pattern continues, so for every
95 *thousand yojanas* travelled, the height increases by sixteen *thousand
yojanas*.  **Explanation:**  The depth of the salt ocean increases by one
*prastha* for every 95 *prasthas* travelled from both the edge of Jambudvipa and
the edge of the salt ocean. Similarly, the depth increases by one *balagra* for
every 95 *balagras* travelled. The same applies for *likkha*, *yavamdhya*,
*angula*, *vitasti*, *rasni*, *kukshi*, *dhanush*, *kośa*, *yojana*, *hundred
yojanas*, and *thousand yojanas*. This means that for every 95 *thousand
yojanas* travelled, the depth increases by one *thousand yojanas*.  Now, if the
height increases by one *thousand yojanas* for every 95 *thousand yojanas*
travelled, then according to the rule of three, the height increase for 95
*yojanas* can be calculated as follows:  * Set up the three quantities: 95000 /
1000 / 95 * Remove the three zeros from the first two quantities (according to
the rule "zero divided by zero is zero"): 95 / 1 / 95 * Multiply the middle
quantity (1) by the last quantity (95): 1 x 95 = 95 * Divide the result (95) by
the first quantity (95): 95 / 95 = 1  This means that the height increases by
one *yojana* for every 95 *yojanas* travelled. This is what is stated in these
verses.

meaning is that if there is an increase of one yojana in depth after traveling
95 yojanas, then it is easily understood that there is an increase of one
gavyuta after traveling 95 gavyutas, and an increase of one dhanush after
traveling 95 dhanush. This is said with respect to depth. Before this, a
question was asked about the increase in height of the salt sea and an answer
was given. The question was asked: how much water increases after traveling a
certain distance from both sides of the salt sea? The answer is: the increase in
water on the flat ground on both sides of the salt sea is an immeasurable part
of an angul, and further, the increase in water increases gradually with the
increase in the area, reaching an increase of seven hundred yojanas after
traveling 95 thousand yojanas. Beyond that, in an area of ten thousand yojanas,
there is an increase of sixteen thousand yojanas. The meaning is that an
increase in elevation of 16 pradeshas is said to occur after traveling 95
pradeshas (sarenu) from both sides of the salt sea. An increase in elevation of
16 balagra occurs after traveling 95 balagra. Similarly, an increase in
elevation of 16 thousand yojanas occurs after traveling 95 thousand yojanas.
Here, the concept of the rule of three is that if there is an increase in
elevation of sixteen (16) thousand yojanas after traveling 95 thousand yojanas,
then how much will the increase in elevation be after traveling 95 yojanas?
Setting up the three quantities 95000/16000/95, after removing three zeros from
both the first and middle quantities, the quantities become 95/16/95.
Multiplying the middle quantity 16 by the third quantity 95, we get 1520.
Dividing this by the first quantity 95, we get a quotient of 16. That is, there
is an increase in water of 16 yojanas after traveling 95 yojanas. It is said:

## Third Chapter: Explanation of Gotith (Holy Place)  **171.**  O Bhagavan! How
large is the Gotith portion of the Salt Ocean? (The progressively lower and
deeper part is called Gotith.) O Gautama! The Salt Ocean has a Gotith of 95,000
yojanas on both sides. (It is progressively lower and deeper.) O Bhagavan! How
large is the portion of the Salt Ocean that is said to be devoid of Gotith? O
Gautama! The Salt Ocean has a region of 10,000 yojanas that is devoid of Gotith.
(This means that this region of 10,000 yojanas is flat.) O Gautama! How large is
the Udakmala (water garland, a water mass 16,000 yojanas high above the level
water) of the Salt Ocean? O Gautama! The Udakmala is 10,000 yojanas. (The water
mass remaining above the depthless portion is called Udakmala.)  **172.** O
Bhagavan! What is the structure of the Salt Ocean? O Gautama! The Salt Ocean has
the structure of a Gotith, the structure of a boat, the structure of a conch
shell, the structure of a horse's shoulder, the structure of a Valabhi house,
and the structure of a circular and ring-shaped structure. O Bhagavan! What is
the circumference of the Salt Ocean? What is its perimeter? What is its height?
What is its elevation? What is its total size? O Gautama! The Salt Ocean has a
circumference of 200,000 yojanas, a perimeter of 150,000 yojanas plus 1,000
yojanas plus 1 yojana, slightly less than that, a height of 1,000 yojanas, an
elevation of 16,000 yojanas, and a total size of 17,000 yojanas.  **172.** O
Bhagavan! What is the structure of the Salt Ocean? O Gautama! The Salt Ocean has
the structure of a Gotith, the structure of a boat, the structure of a conch
shell, the structure of a horse's shoulder, the structure of a Valabhi house,
and the structure of a circular and ring-shaped structure.  **Notes:**  1.
Gotith is the progressively lower and deeper part of a water body. 2.
"Panchaanauwi sahasse gotithe ubhayano vi lavanassa." This means that the Salt
Ocean has a Gotith of 95,000 yojanas on both sides. 3. Udakmala is a water mass
that is 16,000 yojanas high above the level water. It is the water mass
remaining above the depthless portion of a water body.

##  30] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra, O Bhagavan! What is the diameter of the salt
ocean (Lavanasamudra)? What is its circumference? What is its depth? What is its
height? What is its total measure?  _ Gautama! The diameter of the salt ocean is
two lakh yojanas. Its circumference is slightly less than fifteen lakh eighty-
one thousand one hundred thirty-nine (1581139) yojanas. Its depth is one
thousand yojanas. Its height (utsedha) is sixteen thousand yojanas.  /  The
total measure, including both depth (udvedha) and height (utsedha), is seventeen
thousand yojanas. Discussion - The shape of the salt ocean has been described in
various ways, taking into account different perspectives.  /  It has been said
to be shaped like a Gotirtha (a type of water vessel) due to the gradual
increase in depth. It has been said to be shaped like a boat due to the gradual
increase in water level on both sides, compared to the flat land. It has been
said to be shaped like a soap bubble due to the combination of the water of the
depth (udvedha) and the water of the increase in water level. It has been said
to be shaped like a horse's hump due to the elevation of 95 thousand yojanas on
both sides and the high peak of sixteen thousand yojanas. It has been said to be
shaped like a Valabhi (a type of building) due to the peak of ten thousand
yojanas in width, appearing like a Valabhi. The salt ocean is round and shaped
like a bead. The diameter, circumference, depth, height, and total measure of
the salt ocean are clear from the original meaning. ' 1. Here, the ancient
teachers have also calculated the volume and surface area of the salt ocean,
which is being provided here for those who are curious. The calculation of the
surface area is as follows: From the two lakh yojanas of the salt ocean, ten
thousand yojanas are subtracted, and half of the remaining amount is taken -
this results in 95000. The previously subtracted ten thousand yojanas are added
to this amount, resulting in 105000. This amount is called koti. This koti is
multiplied by the middle circumference (paririya) of the salt ocean, which is
948683, to obtain the surface area. That surface area is - 99611715000  /  It is
said: "Subtract ten thousand from the width, then take half of the remaining
amount.  /  That, added to the previous ten thousand, is the koti of the salt
ocean." ||1|| "Multiply the koti by one lakh five thousand, then multiply by the
middle circumference of the salt ocean.  /  This will be the surface area." // 2
// "Nine hundred ninety-six koti, one hundred eighty-three lakh seventy-seven
thousand.  /  This is the surface area of the salt ocean, as determined." ||3||
The calculation of the volume is as follows: The height of the salt ocean is
16000 yojanas, and the depth is one thousand yojanas, totaling seventeen
thousand yojanas. Multiplying this number by the previously calculated surface
area gives the volume of the salt ocean.  /  That is - 1693399155000000 yojanas
/  It is said: "Sixteen thousand yojanas is the height of the salt ocean, and
one thousand yojanas is the depth.  /  Multiplying the surface area by seventeen
thousand gives the volume of the salt ocean." // 1 // "Sixteen koti koti, nine
hundred ninety-six koti, one hundred thousand.  /  Forty-nine thousand, nine
hundred ninety-six, and fifteen." // 2 // - (On the next page)

## Third Chapter: Explanation of the Gotir  173. If, Venerable Sir, in the Salt
Ocean, with a circumference of two hundred thousand yojanas, there is a wheel-
shaped island with a diameter of fifteen hundred thousand yojanas, and one
thousand yojanas are added to it, and then sixteen thousand yojanas are added to
it, and then seventeen thousand yojanas are added to it, making a total of
forty-four thousand yojanas, then, Venerable Sir, how is it that the Jambudvipa
island in the Salt Ocean does not sink, nor is it submerged, nor does it even
become one with the water?  Gotama: Venerable Sir, in the Jambudvipa island, in
the Bharaherava Vasas, there reside Arhants, Chakravartis, Baladevas, Vasudevas,
Charanas, Vidyadharas, Samanas, Samanis, Savagas, Saviyas, Manuyas, Pagai-
Bhaddayas, Pagai-Vinis, Pagai-Uvasantas, Pagai-Payanas, those who are free from
anger, pride, delusion, and greed, those who are free from malice, those who are
virtuous and wise. Due to their merit, the Jambudvipa island in the Salt Ocean
does not sink, nor is it submerged, nor does it even become one with the water.
In the Ganga, Sindhu, Ratnatar, and Tavi rivers, the Devas and Mahiddhiyas
reside, up to the Pali-Oshti-Iyas. Due to their merit, the Salt Ocean does not
even become one with the water.  In the Chulla-Himalaya peaks, in the Vasahara-
Pabbvas, the Devas and Mahiddhiyas reside. Due to their merit, in the Hemvata-
Arannava Vasas, the Manuyas, Pagai-Bhaddayas, etc., reside.  In the Rohitamsa,
Suvarna-Kula, and Ruppa-Kula rivers, the Devas and Mahiddhiyas reside. Due to
their merit, in the Saddava-Ivi-Dava-Ivi-Vatta-Veyadda-Pabbvas, the Devas and
Mahiddhiyas reside, up to the Pali-Prova-Matti-Iyas.  In the Maha-Himalaya-
Ruppis, in the Vasahara-Pabbvas, the Devas and Mahiddhiyas reside, up to the
Pali-Ova-Matti-Iyas. In the Hariya-Sarambha-Vasas, the Manuyas, Pagai-Bhaddayas,
etc., reside.  In the Gandhava-Ivi-Malavanta-Pariyas, in the Batta-Veyadda-
Pabbvas, the Devas and Mahiddhiyas reside. In the Nisa-Ni-Lavanta-Vasahara-
Pabbvas, the Devas and Mahiddhiyas reside. All these Devas are worthy of being
praised.  In the Paumda-Hati-Giccha-Kesari-Daha-Vasanas, the Devas and
Mahiddhiyas reside. Due to their merit, in the Putya-Videha-Avara-Videhas, in
the Vasas, the Arhants, Chakravartis, Baladevas, Vasudevas, Charanas,
Vidyadharas, Samanas, Samanis, Savagas, Saviyas, Manuyas, Pagai-Bhaddayas, etc.,
reside. Due to their merit, the Salt Ocean...  In the Siya-Sita-Udaga rivers,
the Devas and Mahiddhiyas reside. In the Deva-Kuru and Uttara-Kuru, the Manuyas,
Pagai-Bhaddayas, etc., reside. In the five Mandaras, the Devas and Mahiddhiyas
reside.  The number of yojanas in the Salt Ocean is fifty thousand thousand
yojanas. This is the number of yojanas in the Salt Ocean, as calculated by the
Dhanaganita. // 3 //  Here, there is a doubt that the Salt Ocean is not
seventeen thousand yojanas deep everywhere. In the middle, its depth is only ten
thousand yojanas. How then is this Dhanaganita consistent?  This doubt is true.
But when a straight line is drawn from one edge of the Salt Ocean to the other,
passing over the Salt Peak and both the Bedikantas, the waterless area in
between is also considered to be filled with water, according to the Karana-
Gati. In this regard, the example of Mount Meru is relevant. It is said that
Mount Meru has a loss of one-eleventh of its height everywhere. But this loss is
not the same everywhere. It is more in some places and less in others. Only when
a line is drawn from the base to the peak, the space in between, which is filled
with air, is considered to be part of Mount Meru.  Considering this, the
mathematicians have stated that there is a loss of one-eleventh of the height
everywhere. Jinabhadragani Kshamashraman has also said the same thing in his
book Visheshnavati: "Thus, from both the Bedikantas, sixteen thousand yojanas
are added to the Salt Ocean. The waterless area in between is also considered to
be filled with water. Just as in the case of Mount Meru, the air in between is
considered to be part of the mountain, even though there is a loss of one-
eleventh of its height, so also in the case of the Salt Ocean."  The meaning of
this is clear from the previous explanation. -Vrittikara

[The Statement of the Deadly Continent] The statement of the Deadly Continent
174. The name of the two continents of the Salty Ocean is Dhayi-sande, which is
situated in a circular shape and is surrounded by all sides. Dhayi-sande, O
Venerable! Is it a circular or a non-circular wheel-shaped continent? Gotama! It
is a circular wheel-shaped continent, not a non-circular wheel-shaped continent.
Dhayi-sande, O Venerable! What is the extent of the wheel-shaped continent and
what is its circumference? Gotama! The extent of the wheel-shaped continent is
four hundred thousand yojanas, and its circumference is one hundred and twenty-
one thousand yojanas, ten thousand yojanas, nine hundred yojanas, and a little
more than two hundred yojanas. This is surrounded on all sides by one mountain
peak and one forest, and both these are surrounded by the circumference of the
ocean. Dhayi-sande, O Venerable! How many gates does the continent have? Gotama!
It has four gates - Vijaya, Vaijayante, Jayante, and Aparajita. Tell me, O
Venerable! Which gate is named Vijaya on the continent of Dhayi-sande? Gotama!
The gate named Vijaya on the continent of Dhayi-sande is located where the great
river Soyaa flows out from the eastern side of the continent of Dhayi-sande and
enters the eastern side of the Salty Ocean. This is the measure. The kings of
the other continents of Dhayi-sande, the two continents, should be told and
informed. Thus, these four gates should be told. Dhayi-sande, O Venerable! What
is the distance between the gate and the gate of the continent? Gotama! The
distance between the gate and the gate of the continent is ten thousand yojanas,
twenty-seven thousand yojanas, seventy-five yojanas, and three kosas. Dhayi-
sande, O Venerable! Is the Salty Ocean filled with water? Yes, it is filled.
Then, O Venerable! Is the Salty Ocean on the continent of Dhayi-sande? It is on
Dhayi-sande, not on the Salty Ocean. Thus, it is on the Salty Ocean. Do the
living beings of the continent of Dhayi-sande go to the Salty Ocean? Gotama!
They go to the Salty Ocean, but they do not go to the Salty Ocean. Thus, they go
to the Salty Ocean, but they do not go to the Salty Ocean. Why, O Venerable! Is
it like this - Dhayi-sande continent, Dhayi-sande continent? Gotama! The two
Dhayi-sandes are there, and there are Dhayi-rukkhas, Dhayi-vanas, and Dhayi-
vanasandas everywhere.

[The Statement of the Third Section of the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa] [35 O Bhagavan! Where
is the Vijayadvara of the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa-dvīpa located? Gautama! The Vijayadvara
of the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa is located at the end of the eastern direction of the
Dhātaki-khaṇḍa and in the western direction of the eastern half of the Kāloda-
samudra, above the Śītā Mahānādī. / One should know its proof like the
Vijayadvara of the Jambū-dvīpa. / Its capital is in another Dhātaki-khaṇḍa-
dvīpa, etc., one should know its description like the Vijayā capital of the
Jambū-dvīpa. In the same way, one should understand the description of all four
doors including the Vijayadvara. O Bhagavan! What is the distance between one
door and another door of the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa? Gautama! The distance between one
door and another is ten lakh twenty-seven thousand seven hundred thirty-five
(1027735) yojanas and three kosas. (The thickness of each door including the
door branch is four and a half yojanas. The thickness of the four doors is 18
yojanas. Subtracting 18 yojanas from the circumference of the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa,
which is 4110961 yojanas, gives 4110943 yojanas. Dividing this by four gives the
said distance between each door.) Bhagavan! Are the regions of the Dhātaki-
khaṇḍa-dvīpa touched by the Kāloda-samudra? Yes Gautama! They are touched.
Bhagavan! Are those regions of the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa or the Kāloda-samudra?
Gautama! Those regions are of the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa, not of the Kāloda-samudra. In
the same way, one should say about the regions of the Kāloda-samudra. Bhagavan!
Do the beings born in the Kāloda-samudra come out (die) from the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa?
Gautama! Some beings are born, some beings are not born. In the same way, some
beings are born in the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa-dvīpa from the Kāloda-samudra and some are
not born. Bhagavan! Why is it said that the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa is the Dhātaki-
khaṇḍa? Gautama! In the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa-dvīpa, here and there, Dhātaki trees,
Dhātaki forests and Dhātaki forest tracts are always blooming and are situated
beautifully. Two great gods named Sudarśana and Priyadarśana, who have the
characteristics of Palyopama, reside on the Dhātaki Mahādhātaki trees.
Therefore, the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa is called the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa. Gautama! The second
thing is that the name Dhātaki-khaṇḍa is eternal. (It is eternal in relation to
the substance and impermanent in relation to the synonym) Therefore, its name is
eternal from the beginning of time. Bhagavan! How many moons have shone, are
shining and will shine in the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa-dvīpa? How many suns were, are and
will be hot? How many great planets were, are and will be moving? How many stars
were, are and will be in conjunction with the moon, etc.? And how many Kodakoḍī
star groups were, are and will be shining? 1. Paṇatīsā satta saya sattavīsā

## Third Rebirth: The Description of Pushkaravaradvipa  The description of
Pushkaravaradvipa is as follows: 9170587 yojanas. Dividing this by 4, we get
2292646 yojanas and 3 kosas.   O Bhagavan! Is the region of Kalod Ocean touching
Pushkaravaradvipa?    This question should be asked in the same way as before,
until it is established that some beings from Pushkaravaradvipa are born in the
Kalod Ocean after death, and some are not.   O Bhagavan! Why is the Kalod Ocean
called Kalod Ocean?   Gautama! The water of the Kalod Ocean is palatable, fleshy
(heavy), smooth (pleasant to taste), black, the color of a heap of black gram,
and naturally sweet. Therefore, it is called Kalod.   There reside two great
gods named Kal and Mahakal, who are in the state of Palyopama. Therefore, it is
called Kalod.   Gautama! Another reason is that the Kalod Ocean is eternal, so
its name is also eternal and unimitable.   O Bhagavan! How many moons were
shining in the Kalod Ocean? This question should be asked in the same way as
before.   Gautama! Forty-two moons were shining, are shining, and will shine in
the Kalod Ocean.   The scripture says that forty-two moons and forty-two suns,
with their associated rays, wander in the Kalod Ocean.   One thousand one
hundred and seventy-six stars, three thousand six hundred and sixty-nine
Mahagrahas, and twenty-eight lakh twelve thousand nine hundred and fifty
Kodakodi stars were shining, are shining, and will shine.   The description of
Pushkaravaradvipa: 176. (a) The Kalod Ocean surrounds Pushkaravaradvipa, which
is situated in the form of a circular ring, and is completely surrounded by it.
It is like this until the circular ring of the Samchakkavala, and not like the
circular ring of the Visamchakkavala.   O Bhagavan! What is the diameter of the
circular ring of Pushkaravaradvipa, and what is its circumference?   Gautama!
The diameter of the circular ring is sixteen thousand yojanas. One yojana is
equal to one hundred thousand banas.   The circumference of Pushkaravaradvipa is
eighty-nine thousand eight hundred and forty-nine yojanas.   It is surrounded by
one Paumavaraveya and one Vanasanda.   It has two colors.   O Bhagavan! How many
gates are there in Pushkaravaradvipa?   Gautama! There are four gates, namely:
Vijaya, Vejayante, Jayante, and Aparajita.   O Bhagavan! Where is the gate named
Vijaya in Pushkaravaradvipa?   Gautama! It is located in the south-west of
Pushkaravaradvipa, at the south-west end of the Pushkarod Ocean.   1. The three
verses present in this text were not found in the copies available to the
commentator. It seems that he has quoted these three verses in his commentary by
writing "Anyatrapyuktam".  - Editor

[41] **O Bhagavan! Where is the victory gate of Pushkaravaradvipa?**
**Gautama:** The victory gate of Pushkaravaradvipa is located in the eastern
extremity of Pushkaravaradvipa and in the western part of the eastern half of
Pushkarodasamudra. The description should be similar to that of the victory gate
of Jambudvipa. Similarly, one should know the description of all four gates.
However, the harmony of the Shota and Shitota rivers should not be mentioned.
**O Bhagavan! What is the distance between one gate and another of
Pushkaravaradvipa?**  **Gautama:** The distance is forty-eight lakh twenty-two
thousand four hundred sixty-nine (4822469) yojanas. (The thickness of all four
gates is 18 yojanas. Subtracting 18 yojanas from the circumference of
Pushkaravaradvipa, which is 19289894 yojanas, gives 19289876 yojanas. Dividing
this amount by 4 gives the above result.)  The regions of Pushkaravaradvipa are
in contact with Pushkaravarasamudra and they belong to it. Similarly, the
regions of Pushkaravarasamudra are in contact with Pushkaravaradvipa and belong
to it. The beings of Pushkaravaradvipa and Pushkaravarasamudra, after death,
some are born in them and some are not born in them.  **O Bhagavan! Why is
Pushkaravaradvipa called Pushkaravaradvipa?**  **Gautama:** In
Pushkaravaradvipa, there are many Padmavaksha, Padmavana, and Pavatakhunda,
which are always in bloom. There are two great gods named Padma and Pundarika,
who reside on the Padma and Mahapadma trees, which are like the Palyopama.
Therefore, Pushkaravaradvipa is called Pushkaravaradvipa, as long as it is
eternal.  **O Bhagavan! How many moons were, are, and will be shining in
Pushkaravaradvipa?**  **Gautama:** One hundred forty-four moons and one hundred
forty-four suns shine and move in Pushkaravaradvipa. There are four thousand
thirty-two (4032) stars and twelve thousand six hundred seventy-two (12672)
Mahagrahas. Nine lakh sixty-four thousand four hundred (9644400) Kodakodi stars
shine, are shining, and will shine in Pushkaravaradvipa.  **The statement of
Manushottaraparvata 176.**  (Pra) Pushkaravaradvipa is called
Manushottaraparvata in the middle of the many regions. It is like a ring, with a
circular shape, which surrounds Pushkaravaradvipa, dividing it into two parts:
the inner Pushkaradha and the outer Pushkaradha.  **O Bhagavan! What is the
circumference of the inner Pushkaradha?**  **Gautama:** The circumference of the
inner Pushkaradha is eight yojanas, one hundred thousand, one crore, forty-two
thousand, thirty-two, and two hundred.  The circumference of Pushkaravardha is
the same as that of the human realm. // 1 //  **O Bhagavan! Why is it called the
inner Pushkaradha and the outer Pushkaradha?**

[42]  Gautama! The Manushottara mountain, which is round and situated in the
middle of the Pushkaravardvipa, is surrounded by a circular structure. This
mountain divides the Pushkaravardvipa into two parts: the inner Pushkarardha and
the outer Pushkarardha.  /  Lord! What is the diameter of the inner Pushkarardha
and what is its circumference? Gautama! Its diameter is eight lakh yojanas and
its circumference is one crore, forty-two lakh, thirty thousand, two hundred and
forty-nine (1,42,30,249) yojanas.  /  The circumference of the Manushya-kshetra
is also the same. Lord! Why is the inner Pushkarardha called the inner
Pushkarardha? Gautama! The inner Pushkarardha is surrounded on all sides by the
Manushottara mountain. Therefore, it is called the inner Pushkarardha.  /
Secondly, it is eternal (hence it is called animittaka). Lord! How many moons
were, are and will be illuminating the inner Pushkarardha? The same question
should be asked about the countless stars.  _ Gautama! Seventy-two moons and
seventy-two suns illuminate the Pushkaravardvipa and move around it.  /  / 1 //
Six thousand three hundred and thirty-six Mahagrahas and two thousand sixteen
stars move and combine with the moon and others.  /  /  2  //  Forty-eight lakh
twenty thousand two hundred countless stars adorn the place, adorned it and will
adorn it.  /  / 3 //  Discussion - Everywhere, by countless stars, one should
understand crores (koti).  /  The ancient teachers have explained it in this
way. Because the area is small. Other teachers, according to the Utshedha-
anguli-pramana, consider countless as countless.  /  It is said

[Description of the Time-Realm (Human Realm)] [43 "Koda-kodi sanantaram tu
mannati kei thovataya. Anna utsehangulmaanam kaaun taraanam" // 1 //  Commentary
Description of the Time-Realm (Human Realm) 177. (a) O Bhagavan! What is the
length and breadth of the Time-Realm (Human Realm) and what is its
circumference? Gautama! The Time-Realm (Human Realm) is forty-five lakh yojanas
in length and breadth, and its circumference is the same as that of the inner
Pushkaravardvipa, which is one crore, forty-two lakh, thirty thousand, two
hundred and fifty yojanas. O Bhagavan! Why is the Human Realm called the Human
Realm? Gautama! Three types of humans reside in the Human Realm, namely:
Karmabhumika, Akarmabhumika and Antarvipaka. Therefore, it is called the Human
Realm. O Bhagavan! How many moons were, are and will be illuminating the Human
Realm? How many suns were, are and will be shining? One should ask such
questions. Gautama! In the Time-Realm (Human Realm), one hundred and thirty-two
moons and one hundred and thirty-two suns illuminate and wander throughout the
entire Human Realm.  /  /  1  /  /

[Description of the Time Zone (Human Zone)] [45 There is one pitaka of two moons
and two suns. From this standard, there are 66-66 (sixty-six-sixty-six) pitakas
of moons and suns in the human realm. 1 pitaka in Jambudvipa, 2 pitakas in
Lavanasamudra, 6 pitakas in Dhataki Khand, 21 pitakas in Kalodadhi, and 36
pitakas in Ardhapushkaravardvipa, totaling 66 pitakas of suns and 66 pitakas of
moons // 4 // There are 66 pitakas of stars in the human realm. Each pitaka has
fifty-six fifty-six stars // 5 // There are 66 pitakas of mahagrahas in the
human realm // Each pitaka has 176-176 mahagrahas // 6 // In this human realm,
there are four-four rows of moons and suns. Each row has 66-66 moons and suns //
7 // In this human realm, there are 56 rows of stars // Each row has 66-66 stars
// 8 // In this human realm, there are 176 rows of planets. Each row has 66-66
planets. All these celestial bodies, including the moon and sun, revolve around
Mount Meru. While revolving, Meru is to the south of these moon etc., therefore
it is called the Pradakshinavartamandala. (All the celestial bodies in the human
realm revolve in the Pradakshinavartamandala motion.) The mandalas of the moon,
sun, and planets are unstable (because they revolve around other mandalas as per
their respective roles). 177. (e) The constellations are to be considered as
circles // They revolve in the same direction as the sun and moon // 11 // There
is no movement of the sun, moon, and planets in the upward or downward direction
// There is movement of the mandalas only inwards, outwards, and sideways // 12
// The sun, moon, planets, and stars, and mahagrahas, cause happiness and sorrow
to humans in four ways // 13 // The size of their respective zones increases as
they enter // They decrease in size as they exit // 14 // The time zone is
determined by the combination of the moon, sun, and stars // The moon and sun
are contracted at the end and expanded outwards // 15 // What causes the moon to
increase and decrease? // Is it time or the sun, or is it due to the influence
of the sun? // 16 // Why is the Rahu always with the moon? // It revolves around
the moon, even a distance of four angulas // 17 // The moon increases by 32 in
the bright fortnight // The moon decreases by the same amount in the dark
fortnight // 18 //

## 46. The Jiva-Jiva-Migama Sutra  **19.**  The moon is worshipped with fifteen
parts, and the moon is also worshipped with fifteen parts.  The moon is also
worshipped with fifteen parts, and the moon is also worshipped with fifteen
parts.  **20.**  Thus, the moon is said to be a circle, and the moon is also
said to be a circle.  The moon is also said to be a circle, and the moon is also
said to be a circle.  **21.**  In the human realm, there are four types of
beings.  There are five types of moons, suns, and stars.  **22.**  Beyond that,
there are other moons, suns, and stars.  There are no other beings in the four
directions.  **23.**  There are two moons, two suns, and four oceans of salt.
There are two moons and two suns in the Dhāyisaṇḍa.  **24.**  There are two
Jambudvīpas, two suns, and twice as many moons in the salt ocean.  There are
three times as many moons and suns in the Dhāyisaṇḍa.  **25.**  The Dhāyisaṇḍa
is three times as large as the moon.  There are countless moons in the countless
realms.  **26.**  The name of the star cluster that surrounds the sun is the
"Day-Moon."  The number of stars in the star cluster is multiplied by the number
of suns.  **27.**  The distance between the moon and the sun, and the sun and
the moon, is fifty thousand yojanas.  **28.**  The distance between the sun and
the sun, and the moon and the moon, is one hundred thousand yojanas outside the
human city.  **29.**  The sun and the moon are in the sky, and the day and night
are in the sky.  The mind is in the sky, and the happiness is in the sky.
**30.**  There are eighty-eight stars and twenty-eight constellations.  I will
describe the family of one star.  **31.**  There are thirty-six thousand, nine
hundred, and five hundred stars in the family of one star.  The number of stars
in the family of one star is countless.  **32.**  The moons and suns are in the
four directions outside the human city.  The moons are still in the sky, and the
suns are still in the sky.  **177.**  (i) The constellations and stars are
located in a mandala.  That is, they remain in one mandala for a fixed period of
time.  (But this does not mean that they do not move), they also revolve around
Mount Meru in a circular motion.  // 11 //  The moon and the sun do not move up
and down (because that is the nature of the world).

[Description of the Time-Sphere (Human-Sphere)] Their movement is transverse,
from the innermost circle to the outermost circle and from the outermost circle
to the innermost circle. // 12 // // The Moon, Sun, Stars, Major Planets and
Stars, with their specific movements, affect the happiness and sorrow of humans.
// 13 // // As the Sun and Moon enter from the outermost circle to the innermost
circle, their heat-sphere increases daily, in a regular manner, in proportion to
the effort (of the soul). And in the same order, as they exit from the innermost
circle to the outside, the heat-sphere of the Sun and Moon decreases daily. //
14 // // The path of the heat-sphere of those Moon-Suns is like the shape of a
Kadamba flower. It is narrow in the direction of Meru and wide in the direction
of the Salt Sea. // 15 // // O Bhagavan! Why does the Moon increase in the
waxing phase and decrease in the waning phase? What is the reason for the waning
and waxing phases? // 16 // // . Gautama! The Rahu-Vimana, of dark color, always
remains four fingers away from the Moon, moving below the Moon-Vimana. // (In
this way, as it moves, it gradually reveals the Moon in the waxing phase and
gradually covers it in the waning phase. // 17 // // In the waxing phase, the
Moon increases by 62 parts of the Moon-Vimana daily, and in the waning phase, it
decreases by 62 parts. [Here, the explanation of 62 parts should be done in such
a way that the Moon-Vimana should be divided into 62 parts. Of these, the top
two parts are naturally not capable of being covered (covered), so they should
be left out. When the remaining 60 parts are divided by 15, four parts are
obtained. // These four parts should be understood as the meaning of 62 parts
here. Chanikara has also given a similar explanation. According to tradition,
the sutra should be explained, not by one's own intellect.] // 18 // // In the
waning phase, the Rahu-Vimana covers the fifteenth part of the Moon-Vimana with
its fifteenth part, and in the waxing phase, it releases that same fifteenth
part. // 19 // // In this way, the Moon increases and decreases, and for this
reason, there are waning and waxing phases. // 20 // // Within the Human-Sphere,
there are five types of celestial bodies: Moon, Sun, Planets, Stars and Stars,
which are in motion. // 21 // // Beyond (outside) the two and a half islands,
the five types of Moon, Sun, Planets, Stars and Stars do not move, do not move
(from the circular motion), therefore they are situated (stationary). // 22 //
// _ In this Jambudvipa, there are two Moons and two Suns. In the Salt Sea,
there are four Moons and four Suns. In the Ghataki-Khanda, there are twelve
Moons and twelve Suns. // 23 // // In Jambudvipa, there are two Moons and two
Suns. // There are twice as many in the Salt Sea, and three times as many Moons
and Suns in the Ghataki-Khanda as there are in the Salt Sea. // 24 // //

## Translation:  **[Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra, Dhataki-Khand]**  **[Regarding the
number of Moons and Suns in the oceans and islands beyond the Ghataki-Khand]**
The number of Moons and Suns in the oceans and islands beyond the Ghataki-Khand
should be tripled from the number in the previous ocean or island, and then the
total number of Moons and Suns from all the previous oceans and islands should
be added to it. (For example, if there are 12 Moons and 12 Suns in the Ghataki-
Khand, then there would be 12 x 3 = 36 Moons and Suns in the Kalodadhi Ocean.
Adding the 2 Moons and Suns from Jambudvipa and 4 Moons and Suns from the Lavana
Ocean, the total number of Moons and Suns in the Kalodadhi Ocean would be 42.)
This method can be used to determine the number of Moons and Suns in the
subsequent islands and oceans. // 25 //  **[Regarding the number of stars,
planets, and Kodakodo stars in the islands and oceans]**  To determine the
number of stars, planets, and Kodakodo stars in any island or ocean, multiply
the number of Moons and Suns in that island or ocean by the number of stars,
planets, and Kodakodo stars in one Moon's family. (For example, there are 4
Moons in the Lavana Ocean. Each Moon's family has 28 stars, so there would be 28
x 4 = 112 stars in the Lavana Ocean. Each Moon's family has 88 planets, so there
would be 88 x 4 = 352 planets in the Lavana Ocean. Each Moon's family has 66,975
Kodakodo stars, so there would be 66,975 x 4 = 267,900 Kodakodo stars in the
Lavana Ocean.) // 26 //  **[Regarding the distance between Moons and Suns
outside the Manushya-Kshetra]**  The distance between Moons and Suns outside the
Manushya-Kshetra is 50,000 yojanas. This distance should be understood as the
distance from one Moon to one Sun and from one Sun to one Moon. // 27 //
**[Regarding the distance between Suns and Moons outside the Manushya-Kshetra]**
The distance between Suns and Suns and between Moons and Moons outside the
Manushya-Kshetra is 100,000 yojanas. // 28 //  **[Regarding the nature of Moons
and Suns outside the Manushya-Kshetra]**  The Moons and Suns outside the
Manushya-Kshetra are arranged in rows and are illuminated by their own
brilliance. Their distance and the nature of their light are unique and varied.
(The light of the Moon is cool, and the light of the Sun is warm. The light of
these Moons and Suns, being different from each other, is neither extremely cold
nor extremely warm like the Manushya-Kshetra, but rather pleasant.) // 29 //
**[Regarding the number of planets and stars in one Moon's family]**  One Moon's
family has 88 planets and 28 stars. The number of stars will be explained in the
following verses. // 30 //  **[Regarding the number of Kodakodo stars in one
Moon's family]**  One Moon's family has 66,975 Kodakodo stars. // 31 //
**[Regarding the nature of Moons and Suns outside the Manushya-Kshetra]**  The
Moons and Suns outside the Manushya-Kshetra are situated in a way that is
conducive to well-being. The Moons are associated with the Abhijit Nakshatra,
and the Suns are associated with the Pushya Nakshatra. (Some texts mention
"Avatt-hiya Te-ya," which means "situated with brilliance." This indicates that
there is no extreme heat or cold in these regions, unlike the Manushya-Kshetra.)
// 32 //  **[Explanation of the verses]**  The above verses are self-
explanatory. The 13th verse states that the movements of these Moons, Suns,
stars, planets, and Kodakodo stars influence the happiness and sorrow of humans.
The commentator explains this by saying that human actions are always of two
types: auspicious and inauspicious. The causes of the results of actions are
generally five: substance, place, time, feeling, and birth.

[Description of the Time-Field (Human-Field)] The causes of the rise, decline,
decline-cessation, and cessation of karma have been described. Substance, field,
time, state, and existence are the causes. // 1 //  That is, substance, field,
time, state, and existence are the causes of the rise, decline, decline-
cessation, and cessation of karma. Generally, auspicious substances, fields,
etc. are the causes of the fruition of auspicious karma, and inauspicious
substances, fields, etc. are the causes of the fruition of inauspicious karma.
Therefore, when the movement of the moon, etc. is favorable to the birth star,
etc. of individuals, then the auspicious karma of those individuals, along with
the various materials of fruition, arise, due to which the body experiences
health, wealth, cessation of enmity, association with loved ones, success in
endeavors, etc., resulting in happiness. / Therefore, a highly discerning and
intelligent person begins any work on an auspicious day, star, etc., regardless
of whether it is necessary or not. The Tirthankaras also command that acts like
renunciation (initiation) should be performed in an auspicious field, facing an
auspicious direction, at an auspicious day, star, etc., as stated in the
Panchvastik Granth. Such is the knowledge of the Jinas, who have described the
field of karma. / The cause of the rise is what should be honored everywhere. //
1 // Therefore, those who are in the state of a seeker should be mindful of
auspicious fields and auspicious moments. Those who are supremely knowledgeable,
the Bhagavants, know the presence or absence of obstacles by virtue of their
supreme knowledge, and therefore they do not rely on auspicious days, stars,
etc. / It is not appropriate for seekers to do the same. Those who say that the
Bhagavants did not observe auspicious days, etc., for those who came to them for
renunciation, are incorrect. / The Bhagavants are supremely knowledgeable. It is
not appropriate for seekers to imitate them. / Therefore, it is appropriate to
begin work on auspicious days, etc., at auspicious moments. In this way, the
movement of the planets, etc., becomes a cause of happiness and sorrow for
humans. 178. (a) "Venerable sir, what is the height of Mount Meru in man-
yojanas? What is its width? What is its diameter at the base? What is its
diameter at the peak? What is its circumference at the base? What is its
circumference at the outer edge? What is its circumference at the middle? What
is its circumference at the top?" "Gotama, Mount Meru is seventeen hundred and
twenty-one man-yojanas high, four hundred and thirty man-yojanas wide, ten
thousand and twenty-four man-yojanas in diameter at the base, seventy-seven
thousand and twenty-four man-yojanas in diameter at the middle, forty-four
thousand and twenty-four man-yojanas in diameter at the top, one yojana-koti,
forty-two hundred thousand, thirty thousand, and two hundred and twenty man-
yojanas in circumference at the base, with a slight excess. / Its circumference
at the outer edge is one yojana-koti, forty-two hundred thousand, thirty-six
thousand, and seventy-four man-yojanas. / Its circumference at the middle is one
yojana-koti, forty-two hundred thousand, forty thousand, and eighty-eight man-
yojanas. / Its circumference at the top is one yojana-koti, forty-two hundred
thousand, thirty-two thousand, and ninety-two man-yojanas. / It is narrow at the
base, dense in the middle, and thin at the top. It is well-defined at the base,
prominent in the middle, and visible from the outside. It is well-formed."

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):  The height of the Manusuttara
mountain is 1721 yojanas above the earth. It is 430 yojanas and one kosa deep in
the earth. At the base, it is 1022 yojanas wide, in the middle it is 723 yojanas
wide, and at the top it is 424 yojanas wide. The circumference within the earth
is one crore, forty-two lakhs, thirty thousand, two hundred and forty-nine
(1,42,30,249) yojanas. The outer circumference below is one crore, forty-two
lakhs, thirty-six thousand, seven hundred and fourteen (1,42,36,714) yojanas.
The middle circumference is one crore, forty-two lakhs, thirty-four thousand,
eight hundred and twenty-three (1,42,34,823) yojanas. The upper circumference is
one crore, forty-two lakhs, thirty-two thousand, nine hundred and thirty-two
(1,42,32,932) yojanas. This mountain is wide at the base, narrow in the middle,
and thin at the top. It is smooth within, excellent in the middle, and visible
on the outside.  The Manusuttara mountain is seated in a slightly bent posture,
like a lion sitting with its front legs extended and the hind legs folded. It
has an elevated top and a lower rear portion. The mountain is in the shape of a
heap of barley, with the upper and lower parts tapered and the middle part
elevated. The mountain is entirely made of jambunada (gold), pure like the sky
and crystal, smooth and reflective.  On both sides of the mountain, there are
two lotus-covered platforms and two forest groves surrounding it on all sides.
Gautama asked: "Bhante, how is the Manusuttara mountain described?"  Gautama,
the Manusuttara mountain has humans within it and devas on the outside. Gautama,
the Manusuttara mountain is inaccessible, and no one, whether humans,
vidyadharas, or devas, can ever ascend it or approach it. Therefore, it is said
to be unattainable.  As long as the Manusuttara mountain exists, so long does
this world exist. As long as the continents, oceans, mountains, cities,
villages, up to the Cakravartins, Baladevs, Vasuddevs, Prativasuddevs, rishis,
vidyadharas, ascetics, nuns, disciples, ordinary good people, and the
disciplined exist, so long does this world exist. As long as the time periods of
samaya, avalika, anapana, thova, lava, muhurta, day, night, fortnight, month,
season, ayana, year, yuga, hundred years, thousand years, hundred thousand
years, and so on exist, so long does this world exist.

[52] The human realm extends as far as lunar eclipses, solar eclipses, lunar
halos, solar halos, counter-moons, counter-suns, rainbows, aquatic fish, and
monkey laughter, etc. The human realm extends as far as the arrival, departure,
waxing and waning of the moon, and the continuous movement of the moon, sun,
planets, stars, and constellations, which is called the state of being in
motion.   **Explanation:** This sutra states that the human realm encompasses
everything from the Bharatadi year (region), the Varshdhar mountain, houses,
shops, buildings, villages, cities, capitals, praiseworthy men like Arihantas,
etc., virtuous and humble humans like Prakritibhradrikas, time, etc., to
electricity, thunder, cloud formation, lightning, mines, rivers, treasures,
wells, ponds, and the movement of the moon, sun, etc., in the sky. The
implication is that all of these things exist only within the human realm. They
do not exist outside of it. The Manushottara mountain is called so because it
marks the boundary of the human realm. Beyond the Manushottara mountain, there
is no existence of these substances and activities.  **Explanation of the Time
Cycle:** The sutra mentions the time cycle, so an explanation is necessary. The
smallest unit of time, which cannot be further divided, is called "samaya." To
understand its subtlety, the scholars have given a gross example.   For example,
a young, strong, healthy, and skilled tailor's son, upon taking a worn-out shawl
in his hand, tears it apart immediately without even extending his hand. To the
onlookers, it seems like he tore the shawl in an instant. However, from a true
perspective, countless "samayas" were involved in tearing the shawl. The shawl
is made of countless threads. The lower thread cannot be torn without the upper
thread being torn first. It must be understood that each thread has its own time
of tearing. Even that thread is made of many fibers. These fibers also tear in
sequence. Therefore, the time taken for the upper fiber of the upper thread to
tear is much subtler than the time taken for the upper thread to tear.   There
are countless "samayas" in a "pravalika." There are countless "pravalikas" in an
"uccvasa," and countless "pravalikas" in a "nishvasa." One "uccvasa" and one
"nishvasa" together make one "an-pran."   **Meaning:** The time taken for one
breath of a healthy and happy person, who is free from labor, hunger, etc., is
called "an-pran." Seven "pran-pranas" make one "stoka," and seven "stokas" make
one "lava."  1. **Hattass Pranavagallas Niruvakittass Jantuno / Ege Usasani-sase

Thus, time from the beginning to Shirshaprahelika is the subject of mathematics.
The time beyond this is known by metaphors, hence it is called Aupamika. The
time known by the metaphor of a moment is called Palyopama and the time known by
the metaphor of an ocean is called Sagaropama / The description of Palyopama and
Sagaropama has been done before. Ten Kodakodi Palyopama makes one Sagaropama /
Ten Kodakodi Sagaropama makes one Avasarpini Kal. The same amount of time makes
one Utsarpini Kal. One Avasarpini and Utsarpini Kal, that is, twenty Kodakodi
Sagaropama makes one Kalchakra. The said Kalchakra is in the human realm /
Because the time-substance is only in the human realm. The commentator has
explained the text after Arihantaadi, including the text of Vidhyutkay, Udar,
Balahak, etc., and after that, he has explained the time, etc. From this, it
appears that the text in front of the commentator was in this order, which is a
matter of belief. But there is a difference in the order, not in the meaning.

period and a maximum of six months. 179. Bhante! The celestial bodies, the moon,
sun, planets, constellations, and stars, that are within the human realm, are
they born in the Urdhva Vimanas (the Vimanas above the twelve Devalokas), or in
the Saudharma and other Kalpas, or in the Jyotishka Vimanas? Are they mobile or
immobile? Do they delight in movement and have attained movement?  _ Gotama!
Those Devas are not born in the Urdhva Vimanas, nor in the twelve Devalokas, but
they are born in the Jyotishka Vimanas. They are mobile, not immobile, they
delight in movement, and they have attained movement.  /  They are arranged in a
circular form like the flowers of the Urdhvamukha Kadamba tree. Their heat
region is thousands of yojanas in extent. They are adorned with various forms of
external attendants, who are transformed by their power. They enjoy divine
pleasures with the sweet sounds of loud instruments, dances, songs, musical
instruments, strings, rhythms, flutes, mridangas, etc. They roar with joy,
whistle, and gurgle, while circumambulating the Meru, the king of mountains, in
a clockwise circular motion.  Bhagavan! When the Indra of those celestial Devas
dies, what do those Devas do in the absence of Indra? Gotama! Four or five
Samāniyas together perform the duties of Indra until another Indra is born
there. Bhagavan! For how long does the position of Indra remain vacant from the
time of Indra's death? Gotama! The position of Indra remains vacant for a
minimum of one time period and a maximum of six months.

**The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra, Venerable One!**  Are the celestial bodies, such
as the Moon, Sun, planets, constellations, and stars, outside the human realm,
*Uvopapanna*, *Kalpopapanna*, *Vimanopapanna*, mobile, or stationary? Are they
desirous of motion, and have they attained motion?  **Gautama:** Those deities
are not *Uvopapanna*, nor *Kalpopapanna*, but *Vimanopapanna*. They are not
mobile, they are stationary. They are not desirous of motion, nor have they
attained motion.  They are the size of a baked brick, and their sphere of heat
extends for millions of yojanas. They experience divine enjoyments with the loud
sounds of musical instruments, dances, songs, and the sweet melodies of
instruments, along with thousands of external assemblies of deities who are
*Vikurvita*.  They are radiant with auspicious light, their rays are cool and
gentle, their heat and light are not intense, and their light is of a peculiar
kind.  They are situated in one place, like a peak. The light of these Moons and
Suns, etc., is mixed with each other. They illuminate, irradiate, heat, and
brighten that region from all sides with their combined rays of light.
**Venerable One!** When the Indra of these deities passes away, what do they do?
**Gautama:** Until four or five *Samanika* deities collectively take his place,
they continue to function until another Indra is born there.  **Lord!** For how
long is that Indra-position devoid of an Indra?  **Gautama:** The Indra-position
can be devoid of an Indra for a minimum of one time period and a maximum of six
months.  **The Description of the Pushkarod-Sea**  **180. (a)** The Pushkarod-
Sea is named Pushkaravar, and it is situated in a circular enclosure, like a
ring, and is surrounded by a wall.  **Venerable One!** What is the circumference
of the wheel-wall of the Pushkarod-Sea, and what is its perimeter?  **Gautama:**
It has a circumference of countless hundreds of thousands of yojanas, and a
perimeter of countless hundreds of thousands of yojanas.  **How many gates does
the Pushkarod-Sea have?**  **Gautama:** It has four gates. Similarly, all the
cities situated on the Pushkarod-Sea, including the city of Varuna-Varada, are
situated on the western side. Here, on the Pushkarod-Sea, there is a gate named
Vijaya. The same applies to the other gates.  There is a distance of countless
hundreds of thousands of yojanas between the gates.  **The Jivas in the Region**
**Venerable One!** Why is it called Pushkarod-Pushkarod?  **Gautama:** On the
eastern side of the Pushkarod-Sea, there are two deities named Siridhara and
Siriprabha, who are born from the fine, fragrant, and reddish-brown dust that
falls from the sky. They wander from the Mahiddhiya to the Paliovamattiya.  This
is why it is called Pushkarod-Pushkarod.

[57] "Venerable one, how many moons illuminate the Pushkarod Ocean? Or, how many
moons illuminate it, even up to countless constellations?" / 180. (a) "The
Pushkarod Ocean, formed by a circular and annular structure, surrounds the
Pushkaravardvipa from all sides. Venerable one, what is the diameter of the
Pushkarod Ocean and what is its circumference? Gautama, its diameter is a
hundred thousand yojanas in number, and its circumference is also a hundred
thousand yojanas in number. / (It is surrounded on all sides by a lotus-like
platform and a forest.) Venerable one, how many gates does the Pushkarod Ocean
have? Gautama, it has four gates. You should state the rest as before, until you
reach the eastern boundary of the Pushkarod Ocean and the western part of the
eastern half of the Varunavardvipa, where the Vijayadvara of the Pushkarod Ocean
is located (you should state everything like the Vijayadvara of Jambudvipa). /
Until you reach the capital city in the other Pushkarod Ocean. Similarly, you
should state the rest of the gates. The distance between these gates is a
hundred thousand yojanas in number. You should also state the details related to
the touch of the land and the origin of the living beings as before. Venerable
one, why is the Pushkarod Ocean called the Pushkarod Ocean? Gautama, the water
of the Pushkarod Ocean is pure, wholesome, of good quality (not mixed with other
substances), light, has the brilliance of a crystal gem, and is naturally sweet.
Two great deities named Shridhar and Shri Prabha, who are like the moon and the
sun, reside there. This makes its water as beautiful as the light is beautified
by the moon, the sun, and the planets and stars. / Therefore, it is called
Pushkarod, because it is eternal, it is also called by the name of the eternal."
Venerable one, how many moons illuminated, illuminate, and will illuminate the
Pushkarod Ocean? You should ask the question as before. Gautama, you should
state as before that countless moons illuminated, illuminate, and will
illuminate it, until you reach countless constellations that adorned, adorn, and
will adorn it. 180. (a) "Venerable one, the Varunavardvipa surrounds the
Pushkarod Ocean in a circular and annular structure, just as it is in the same
circular structure. What is its diameter? What is its circumference? Gautama,
its diameter is a hundred thousand yojanas in number, and its circumference is
also a hundred thousand yojanas in number, the description of the lotus-like
platform and the forest. / The distance between the gates, the land, the living
beings, everything is the same. / Venerable one, why is it called
Varunavardvipa? Why is it called Varunavardvipa?"

according to the number of Jois. / 180. (i) The ocean named Varunod, which is
established in a round and circular form, is situated surrounding the Varunavara
island on all sides. That Varunod ocean is established with a uniform circular
wall, not with a non-uniform circular wall, etc., all statements should be said
as before. / The diameter and circumference should be said to be one lakh
yojanas in number. The Padmavara-vedika, the forest-tract, the gate, the gate-
interval, the touching of the regions, the origin of life, and the questions
related to meaning should be said as before. [O Bhagavan! Why is the Varunod
ocean called the Varunod ocean?] Gautama! The water of the Varunod ocean is the
well-known sura named Chandra-prabha, the Manishalaaka-sura, the best Sidhu-
sura, the best Varuni-sura, the passava of Dhaataki-leaves, the Pushpa-asava,
the Choya-asava, the Phala-asava, the Madhu, the Meraka, the Jaati-pushpa, the
fragrant, pleasant sura, the essence of date-palm, the essence of Mridhika
(grape), the Kapishaayana-sura, the well-cooked juice of sugarcane, the sura
prepared by hundreds of physicians in the Pausha month, with many ingredients,
free from defects, and made with special treatment, repeatedly washed, with
excellent intoxicating power, produced from the offering of Paata (beaten)
barley, the sura named Jambha-phala-kalivar-prasanna, the sweet, thick,
pleasant, very excellent in taste, quickly touching the lips and moving forward,
making the eyes slightly red, mixed with cardamom, etc., causing a slight
bitterness (pungency) after drinking, colored, fragrant, pleasant to touch,
palatable, especially tasty, nourishing the elements, digestive (kindling the
digestive fire), aphrodisiac (arousing desire), and producing delight in all the
senses and the body, etc., is the water of the Varunod ocean like that? Gautama!
No. / The water of the Varunod ocean is even more desirable, more radiant, more
beloved, more pleasant, and more satisfying to the mind than these. Therefore,
it is called the Varunod ocean. There, two gods named Varuni and Varunakaanta
remain in the state of Mahiddiya, even until the state of Palyopama. Therefore,
it is also called the Varunod ocean. / Or, O Gautama! The Varunod ocean (in
terms of substance) is eternal, it always was, is, and will be, therefore, its
name is also eternal, being without cause. (Atu-pitta-puttha-muravai-tavara-

Jīvājīvābhigamasūtra  [60] Bhagavan! One should ask questions such as: How many
moons illuminate the Varuṇoda ocean, how many are illuminating it now, and how
many will illuminate it in the future? Gautama! One should say that in the
Varuṇoda ocean, the moon, sun, stars, planets, etc. are all innumerable.  The
Kṣīravara island and the Kṣīroda ocean: 181. The Kṣīravara island, which has a
circular and ring-shaped form, completely surrounds the Varuṇavara ocean. Its
expanse and circumference are of countless hundreds of thousands of yojanas.
There are many small ponds and streams, as well as rows of caves and crevices,
all filled with Kṣīroda water.  In those small ponds and crevices, there are
many Upāyapanthaka Samvaraṇāmaka (protective deities) and their images. Two
great divine beings, Puṇḍarīka and Puṣkaradanta, reside there. The entire
Kṣīravara island is filled with innumerable luminaries.  The Kṣīroda ocean
completely surrounds the Kṣīravara island, which has a circular and ring-shaped
form. Its expanse and circumference are also of countless hundreds of thousands
of yojanas. The water of the Kṣīroda ocean is sweet, pure, and suitable for
drinking, bathing, and other purposes. Two great divine beings, Vimalavimala,
reside there. The number of moons, suns, stars, and planets in that ocean is
also innumerable.

[62] The Ghṛtodavara Island, mentioned in the Jīvā Jīvābhigama Sūtra, is
situated in the Ghṛtoda Ocean, which surrounds it on all sides. It is round and
has a ring-like structure. It is a Samcakravālasansthāna. / As before, one
should ask questions about the door, the touch of the region, the origin of
life, and the purpose of the name. Gautama! The water of the Ghṛtoda Ocean is
like the essence (sāra) of clarified butter (goghṛta). This goṣṭamand is of a
pale color, like a blooming sallaki, oleander flower, mustard flower, or a
garland of korant. It is oily, shines when exposed to fire, is flawless, and has
a unique beauty. It is like the layer that forms on top of well-churned butter
when it is heated immediately after churning, without being moved, and then
filtered to remove impurities. It is fragrant, pleasing, sweet, and beautiful to
look at. It is wholesome, pure, and enjoyable. Is the water of the Ghṛtoda Ocean
like this clarified butter (goghṛta) essence? When asked this, the Lord says,
"Gautama! The water of the Ghṛtoda Ocean is even more desirable and satisfying
to the mind." There live two great gods named Kānta and Sukānta. / The rest of
the statements should be made as before, until it is said that there were, are,
and will be countless stars (tārāgaṇa-koṭikoṭi). 182. (a) The Ghṛtoda Ocean is
situated on the Khṛtodavara Island, which is round and has a ring-like
structure, as before. On the Khṛtodavara Island, there are many small rivers,
which flow into the Ghṛtoda Ocean. They are all pure, have a good flow, and are
full of water. / There are two great gods named Kānta and Sukānta. / All the
stars are shining, as before, and they are countless (tārāgaṇa-koṭikoṭi). The
Khṛtodavara Island is situated in the Ghṛtoda Ocean, which is round and has a

(The Description of Nandishwar Island)  Punnabhadda and Maṇibhadda (or
Puṇṇapuṇṇabhadda) - these two gods reside there, and the rest is the same.  /
The number of moons, etc. is 182. (a) The island called Kṣodavar, which is round
and ring-shaped, surrounds the Ghṛtodasamudra on all sides.  The description
should be the same as before, up to the meaning of the words.  In the Kṣodavar
island, there are small wells, etc., in various places, which are filled with
Kṣododag (sugarcane juice).  /  There are mountains like Utpat, etc., which are
made of all kinds of precious jewels.  There reside two great gods named
Suprabha and Mahaprabha.  /  Therefore, this island is called Kṣodavar.  /
Here, there are countless moons, suns, planets, stars, and constellations, in
crores and crores.  The Kṣodod ocean surrounds this Kṣodavar island on all
sides.  It is round and ring-shaped, with a diameter and circumference of
countless lakhs of yojanas, etc.  All these statements should be known as
before, up to the question related to the meaning.  Now, it is like this:  O
Gautama! The water of the Kṣodod ocean is more desirable than even the best
sugarcane juice, and it satisfies the mind.  What is the water of the Kṣodod
like?  It is like the sugarcane juice that is delicious, thick, well-rested,
smooth, and delicate, which is planted in the land that has been ploughed by a
skilled farmer with a beautiful and special wooden plough, which is protected by
a skilled man, which has grown in a weed-free land, which has become pure and
thick due to ripening, which is filled with sweet juice, which is free from the
disturbance of winter animals, which has been extracted by strong oxen with a
machine after removing the upper and lower root parts and also its knots, which
has been strained through cloth, and which has been mixed with four types of
fragrant substances (cinnamon, cardamom, saffron, black pepper), which is more
digestible and easy to digest, and which is endowed with good colour, smell,
taste, and touch.  O Gautama! It is even more desirable and satisfying to the
mind.  Two great gods named Punnabhadda and Maṇibhadda (or Puṇṇapuṇṇabhadda)
reside here.  Therefore, this ocean is called Kṣodod.  /  The rest of the
description should be the same as before, up to the point where there were, are,
and will be countless moons, suns, planets, stars, and constellations, in crores
and crores.  The description of Nandishwar island is 183. (a) The Kṣodod ocean
is surrounded by the island called Gandisara, which is round and ring-shaped,
and the description is the same as before.  /  It is surrounded by a wall of
flowers.  /  The doors are like the doors of a house, and the life is the same.
/  Where is that, sir?  O Gautama! In that place, there are many small wells,
etc., which are filled with Kṣododag, which are made for the purpose of bathing,
which are suitable for the purpose of bathing, and which are beautiful to look
at.  /  O Gautama! In the middle of the Gandisara island, which is the size of a
cakravāla, there are four mountains of black collyrium on all four sides.  /
Those mountains of black collyrium are one thousand yojanas high, one thousand
yojanas wide at the base, and ten thousand yojanas long and wide.  Then, they
gradually decrease, one thousand yojanas at a time, until they meet each other.

The Jeevajeevaabhigamsutra states that the circumference of the earth is 31,620
yojanas, while the circumference of the sky is 31,620 yojanas. The height of the
sky is 3,162 yojanas. The earth is wide at the base, narrow in the middle, and
thin at the top, resembling a cow's tail. It is made entirely of anjanaratna, a
type of gemstone, and is adorned with padmavaravedikas (lotus-like platforms)
and vanakhandas (forests). Each anjanapravata (mountain of anjanaratna) has a
vast and beautiful land, as smooth as the stretched skin of a mridanga (drum),
where many vanavyantar devatas (celestial beings) reside and enjoy the fruits of
their good deeds. In the center of these beautiful lands are siddayatanas
(abodes of the perfected), each measuring 100 yojanas in length, 50 yojanas in
width, and 72 yojanas in height, supported by hundreds of pillars. These
siddayatanas have four gates on each side: devadara (gate of the gods),
asuradara (gate of the asuras), nagadara (gate of the nagas), and suvannadara
(gate of gold). In these gates reside four great devatas (gods), who are
unparalleled in their glory and splendor.

The Nandishvara Island is described as follows: [65] There are four gates,
namely Deva, Asura, Naga, and Suvarna. These gates are sixteen yojanas high,
eight yojanas wide, and have an entrance of the same measure. They are all
white, with golden peaks, and adorned with a garland of flowers, etc. All these
details should be understood as similar to the Vijayadvara. There are four
mukhamandapas in each of the four directions of these gates. These mukhamandapas
are one hundred yojanas long, fifty yojanas wide, and sixteen yojanas high. They
are described in the same way as the Vijayadvara. There are four (three) gates
in each of the four (three) directions of these mukhamandapas. These gates are
sixteen yojanas high, eight yojanas wide, and have an entrance of eight yojanas.
All these details should be understood as similar to the Vijayadvara. Similarly,
the details of the Prekshagrihamandapas should be understood. Their dimensions
are the same as those of the mukhamandapas. The gates are also similar. Notably,
in the center of the Prekshagrihamandapas, there are arenas (squares) with
manipethikhas of eight yojanas, family-less thrones, garlands, stupas, etc. in
all four directions. There are also sixteen yojanas high sairegais of sixteen
yojanas in all four directions. All these details should be understood as
similar to the Jina image. The Cheyarukhas are also similar in all four
directions, with the same dimensions as the Vijayadvara. There are nine
manipethikhas of sixteen yojanas in each of the four directions of the
Cheyarukhas. There are four manipethikhas of eight yojanas wide and four yojanas
thick in each of the four directions of the Cheyarukhas. The Mahindajjhaya is
four yojanas high, one yojana deep, and one yojana wide. All these details
should be understood as similar to the Vijayadvara. There are four
Gandhapushkarinis in each of the four directions. They are filled with water and
are one hundred yojanas long, fifty yojanas wide, and fifty yojanas deep. All
these details should be understood as similar to the Vijayadvara. There are
84,000 Manoguliyas in the east, 84,000 in the west, 84,000 in the south, and
84,000 in the north. All these details should be understood as similar to the
Vijayadvara. There are manipethikhas of sixteen yojanas long and wide, and eight
yojanas thick in the center of the island. There are also Devachhandagas of
sixteen yojanas long and wide, and sixteen yojanas high in each of the four
directions of these manipethikhas. They are all made of gold and have 800 Jina
images. This city is similar to the one described in the Vemaaniyasiddhaayana.
[183. (b)] It is said that there are four gates in each of the four directions
of each of these Siddhayatanas. Their names are Devadvara, Asuradvara,
Nagadvara, and Suparnadvara. There are four Devas residing in each of these
gates, who are in the state of Mahddhika or Palyopama. Their names are Deva,
Asura, Naga, and Suparna. These gates are sixteen yojanas high, eight yojanas
wide, and have an entrance of the same measure. All these gates are white, with
golden peaks, and adorned with a garland of flowers, etc. All these details

The directions of the Jeevajeevaabhigamsutra should be described in the same
way. The special feature is that they are slightly more than sixteen yojanas in
length and slightly more than sixteen yojanas in height. The rest should be
described in the same way as the Jinapratimas. There are Chaityavrikshas in all
four directions. Their size is the same as that of the Chaityavrikshas in the
Vijay Rajdhani. The special feature is that the Manipeethika is sixteen yojanas
in size. There are four Manipeethikas around these Chaityavrikshas in all four
directions, which are eight yojanas wide and four yojanas thick. On them is a
Mahendradhvaja, which is sixty-four yojanas high, one yojan deep and one yojan
wide. The rest is the same. In the same way, there are four Nanda Pushkarinis in
all four directions. The special feature is that they are filled with Iksurasa.
Their length is one hundred yojanas, their width is fifty yojanas and their
depth is fifty yojanas. The rest is the same. In those Siddhayatanas, there are
sixteen thousand Manogulikaas (a special type of Peethika) in each direction -
sixteen thousand in the east, sixteen thousand in the west, eight thousand in
the south and eight thousand in the north - a total of forty-eight thousand.
There are also the same number of Gomanooshis (a special type of place for
sleeping). In the same way, one should know the description of the Ulloks
(ceiling, Chandeva) and the land. In the middle is a Manipeethika, which is
sixteen yojanas long and wide and eight yojanas thick. Above those Manipeethikas
are Devachhandakas, which are sixteen yojanas long and wide, slightly more than
sixteen yojanas high, and made of all jewels. In these Devachhandakas are 108
Jinapratimas. One should know the description of all of them as being the same
as the Siddhayatanas of the Vijay Rajdhani of the Vaimanika. 183. (g) There is a
mountain called Anjanaparth in the east. There are four Nanda Pushkarinis in all
four directions of that mountain. Their names are Nanduttara, Nanda, Aananda and
Nandivardhana. (Nandi Sena, Amogha, Gosthupa and Sudarshana - these names are
also mentioned in some places.) These Nanda Pushkarinis are one hundred thousand
yojanas long and wide, their depth is ten yojanas. They are clean and smooth.
Each one is surrounded by four...

The Jivajivaabhigamsutra states that many Bhavanapati, Van-Vyantar, Jyotishka
and Vaimanika Devas gather in this Siddhayatana on the Chaturmasik Pratipada and
other festival days, on the days of the annual festivals, and on the occasions
of the birth, initiation, enlightenment and nirvana Kalyanakas of the Jinesvara
Devas, for the purpose of divine work, divine fairs, divine assemblies, divine
conferences and for the purpose of divine conduct. They gather, participate and,
filled with joy, celebrate the glorious Ashtahnika festival and wander happily.
Two great Devas, Kailasa and Harivahana, who are as vast as the Yavat Palya,
reside there. For this reason, O Gautama! this island is called Nandishvardvipa.
Or, because it is eternal in terms of substance, it is called eternal and
permanent. It has always been there. Here, all the moons, suns, planets, stars
and constellations are countable. 184. The Nandishvardvipa is surrounded on all
sides by the Nandishvara sea, which is round and has a ring-like structure. All
the descriptions should be the same as before (like the Kshododaka). The special
feature is that two great Devas, Sumanas and Saumanasabhadda, reside here. All
the other descriptions should be the same as before, up to the number of stars.
The description of Arunadvipa 185. (a) The Nandishvara sea surrounds the
Arunadvipa, which is round and has a ring-like structure. O Bhagavan! Is the
Arunadvipa a Samachakravalavishkambha or a Visamachakravalavishkambha? Gautama!
It is a Samachakravalavishkambha, not a Visamachakravalavishkambha. O Bhagavan!
What is its Chakravalavishkambha? Gautama! Countless lakhs of yojanas is its
Chakravalavishkambha and countless lakhs of yojanas is its circumference. The
Padmavaravedika, Vanakhanda, Dvara, Dvarantara are also countless lakhs of
yojanas in measure. The reason for this island's name is that there are wells
here filled with water like sugarcane juice. There are Utpata Parvata

[The Statement of Arunadvipa] [71] Bhagavan! Is Ruchakdvipa a
samachakravalavishkambha or a vishamachakravalavishkambha? Gautama! It is a
samachakravalavishkambha, not a vishamachakravalavishkambha. Bhagavan! What is
its chakravalavishkambha? From here onwards, one should know all the
descriptions as before, until there are two mahadhika devas named Sarvartha and
Manorama. / The rest of the statement is as before / The sea named Ruchakoda is
like the Ksodoada sea, with a chakravalavishkambha of countless lakhs of
yojanas, a circumference of countless lakhs of yojanas, and doors and spaces
between doors also of countless lakhs of yojanas. The number of jyotishkas there
should also be said to be countless. The statement of meaning, etc., should be
made like the Ksodoadasamudra. The special feature is that there are two
mahadhika devas named Suman and Saumanas. The rest should be known as before /
All the islands and seas beyond the Ruchakoda sea, their vishkambha,
circumference, doors, spaces between doors, and the number of jyotishkas - all
these should be said to be countless. Surrounding the Ruchakoda sea on all sides
is the island named Ruchakavar, which is round, etc., one should state until
there are two mahadhika devas named Ruchakavarabhadhra and
Ruchakavarmahaabhadhra / In the Ruchakavarodasamudra, there are two devas named
Ruchakavar and Ruchakavarmahaavar, who are mahadhika. In the
Ruchakavaraavbhaasadvipa, there are two mahadhika devas named
Ruchakavaraavbhaasabhadhra and Ruchakavaraavbhaasamahaabhadhra / In the
Rushakavaraavbhaasasamudra, there are two mahadhika devas named
Ruchakavaraavbhaasavar and Ruchakavaraavbhaasamahaavar. In the Haaradvipa, there
are two devas named Haarabhadhra and Haaramahaabhadhra. In the Haarasamudra,
there are two mahadhika devas named Haaravar and Haaravarmahaavar. In the
Haaravardvipa, there are two mahadhika devas named Haaravarabhadhra and
Haaravarmahaabhadhra. In the Haaravarodasamudra, there are two mahadhika devas
named Haaravar and Haaravarmahaavar / In the Haaravaraavbhaasadvipa, there are
two mahadhika devas named Haaravaraavbhaasabhadhra and
Haaravaraavbhaasamahaabhadhra / In the Haaravaraavbhaasodasamudra, there are two
mahadhika devas named Haaravaraavbhaasavar and Haaravaraavbhaasamahaavar. In
this way, one should invent the names of the three avatars and the devas
everywhere. By adding the words "Bhadhra" and "Mahaabhadhra" to the names of the
islands and the word "Var" to the names of the seas, the names of the devas of
those islands and seas are formed, until 1. Suryadvipa, 2. Suryasamudra, 3.
Suryavardvipa, 4. Suryavarasamudra, 5. Suryavaraabhaasadvipa, and 6.
Suryavaraavbhaasasamudra, there are respectively 1. Suryabhadhra and
Suryamahaabhadhra, 2. Suryavar and Suryamahaavar, 3. Suryavarabhadhra and
Suryavarmahaabhadhra, 4. Suryavaravar and Suryavarmahaavar, 5.
Suryavaraavbhaasabhadhra and Suryavaraavbhaasamahaabhadhra, 6.
Suryavaraavbhaasavar and Suryavaraavbhaasamahaavar. From Ksodavardvipa to
Swayambhuraman, the islands and seas have vapikas, until the bilpanktis are
filled with water like iksurasa, and all the mountains are vajramaya in every
way.

[72] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra 185. (E) In the Devadvip, two great Dev (divine
beings) reside - Devabhav and Devmahaabhav / In the Devodasamudra, two great Dev
reside - Devavar and Devmahaavar. Similarly, in the Swayambhuramandvip, two
great Dev reside - Swayambhuramanabhav and Swayambhuramanamahaabhav / The
Swayambhuramandvip is surrounded by the Swayambhuramanasamudra, which is
circular and shaped like a ring, with a circumference of countless lakhs of
yojanas. Why is it called the Swayambhuramanasamudra? Gautam! The water of the
Swayambhuramanasamudra is pure, wholesome, clear, light, has the brilliance of a
crystal, and is full of the natural taste of water. Here, two great Dev reside -
Swayambhuramanavar and Swayambhuramanamahaavar / The rest of the description
should be as before. Here, countless kodikodi (billions) of stars shine, have
shone, and will shine. Discussion - The order of the islands and oceans is as
follows: The first island is Jambudvip. It is surrounded by the Lavanasamudra /
The Lavanasamudra is surrounded by the Dhatakikhand / The Dhatakikhand is
surrounded by the Kalodasamudra / The Kalodasamudra is surrounded by the
Pushkaravardvip. The Pushkaravardvip is surrounded by the Varunasamudra. The
Varunasamudra is surrounded by the Kshiravardvip / The Kshiravardvip is
surrounded by the Ghritoadasamudra. The Ghritoadasamudra is surrounded by the
Kshodavardvip. The Kshodavardvip is surrounded by the Kshododakasamudra. The
Kshododakasamudra is surrounded by the Nandishvardvip / After the Nandishvardvip
is the Nandishvarodasamudra / It is surrounded by the Aran island, then the
Arunodasamudra, then the Arunavardvip, Arunavarodasamudra, Arunavarabhasadvip,
and Arunavarabhasasamudra / Thus, there are three repetitions of the Arunadvip.
After these islands and oceans, there are islands and oceans with auspicious
names like Shankh, Dhwaj, Kalash, Shrivatsa, etc. / All these are three
repetitions / In between, there are Bhujagavar, Kushvar, and Kraunchvar, and all
the auspicious names of ornaments like Har, Ardhar, etc., all the names of
objects like Aajin, etc., all the names of fragrances like Kostha, etc., all the
names of lotuses like Jaluruh, Chandrodhyot, etc., all the names of trees like
Tilaka, etc., all the 36 names of the earth like Prithvi, Sharkara-Baluka,
Uppal, Shila, etc., the nine treasures and fourteen jewels, the year-bearing
mountains like Chull Himavan, etc., the hearts like Padma, Mahapadma, etc., the
great rivers like Ganga, Sindhu, etc., the inner rivers, the 32 victories like
Kachcha, etc., the chest-bearing mountains like Malyaavant, etc., the 12 types

There are as many islands and seas as there are names for the Jambudvipa and
other islands, the 73 peaks, the peaks like Chullahimavan, the 28 constellations
like Krittika, the moons and the suns. All of these are tripratyavatar. After
these, there is the Devadvipa and the Devodasamudra, and finally the
Swayambhuramandvipa and the Swayambhuramanasamudra. The number of islands like
Jambudvipa is 186. (a) How many islands are there, Bhagavan, named Jambudvipa?
Gautama! There are countless islands named Jambudvipa. Bhagavan! How many seas
are there named Lavanasamudra? Gautama! There are countless seas named
Lavanasamudra. In the same way, there are countless islands named Dhataki-
khanda, and so on, until there are countless islands named Suryadvipa. There is
only one island named Devadvipa. There is only one Devodasamudra. In the same
way, there is only one Nagadvipa, Yakshadvipa, Bhootdvipa, and so on, until
there is only one Swayambhuramandvipa. There is only one sea named
Swayambhuramanasamudra. Discussion: The previous sutra describes the order of
the islands and seas. It mentions the tripratyavatar (Arun, Arunavar,
Arunavarabhas, three of each) from Arunadvipa to Suryadvipa. After this, there
is no tripratyavatar. After Suryadvipa, there is Devadvipa and Devodasamudra,
Nagadvipa and Nagodasamudra, Yakshadvipa and Yakshodasamudra, and so on, until
there is Swayambhuramandvipa and Swayambhuramanasamudra. The taste of the waters
of the seas 186. (a) Bhagavan, what is the taste of the water of the
Lavanasamudra? Gautama! The water of the Lavanasamudra is salty, bitter,
pungent, and salty, and it is not suitable for many two-legged, four-legged, and
winged creatures. Bhagavan, what is the taste of the water of the Kaloyas
Samudra? Gautama! The water of the Kaloyas Samudra is sweet, pleasant, and has
the color of a moonbeam. Bhagavan, what is the taste of the water of the
Pukkharodas Samudra? Gautama! The water of the Pukkharodas Samudra is sweet,

Jain Terms Preserved:  The taste of the water of the Lavaṇoda (Saltwater) ocean
is maliṇa (impure), rajjavāla (dusty), without śaivalā (algae), long-
accumulated, salty, and bitter, and therefore not potable for the majority of
bipeds, quadrupeds, animals, birds, and reptiles, but is a beverage for the
beings born and nourished in that very water.  The taste of the water of the
Kāloda ocean is peśala (delightful), māṃsala (nourishing), black, with the hue
of a heap of black gram, and has a natural (akṛtrima) rasa (taste).  The water
of the Puṣkaroda ocean is svaccha (clear), of excellent jāti (quality), laghu
(light), and has the luster of a crystal gem, and has a natural (akṛtrima) rasa
(taste).  The taste of the water of the Varuṇoda ocean is described further.

[The taste of the waters of the oceans] Gautama! Just as Patrasava, Tvchasava,
the essence of dates, well-cooked Ikshurasa (sugarcane juice) and the wines of
Merak-Kapishayan-Chandraprabha-Manah Shila-Varasidhu-Varavaruni and the
Jambhuphal-mixed Varaprasanna variety prepared by grinding eight times are
excellent intoxicants, giving pleasure when applied to the body, making the eyes
slightly red, quickly inducing intoxication, which are palatable, nourishing and
pleasing to the mind, possessing auspicious color etc., such is that water. On
this, Gautama asks if that water is like the aforementioned similes? To this,
the Lord says, "No" this is not right, that water is said to be even more
desirable than that. Bhagavan! How is the water of the Kshirodasamudra in taste?
Gautama! Like the Goksheera (cow's milk) which is transformed into Chaturstan
for the Chaturrant Chakravarti, which is cooked on a slow fire, mixed with sugar
at the beginning and end, which is superior in color, smell, taste and touch,
such is that water. This is just a simile, that water is even more desirable
than this. The taste of the water of the Ghritoadasamudra is like the Mand
(essence-thara) of cow's ghee in the autumn season, which is of the color of
Sallaki and Kaner flowers, well heated, immediately filtered and which is
endowed with superior color, smell, taste and touch. This is just a simile, the
water of the Ghritoadasamudra is even more desirable than this. Bhagavan! How is
the water of the Kshodoadasamudra in taste? Gautama! Like the sugarcane of the
noble, advanced Paundrak caste, born in the Bherund country, which turns yellow
like Harital when ripe, whose joints are black, only the middle three parts,
excluding the top and bottom parts, are extracted by a machine driven by strong
bulls, which is strained through cloth, which is fragrant due to the addition of
four types of cinnamon, cardamom, saffron, black pepper, which is very
wholesome, digestive and endowed with auspicious color etc., such is that water.
This is just a simile, the water of the Kshodoadasamudra is even more desirable
than this. In the same way, one should know the taste of the water of the
remaining oceans up to the Swayambhuramanasamudra. The special feature is that
that water is as pure, noble and wholesome as the water of Pushkarod. Bhagavan!
How many oceans are said to be of each taste? Gautama! Four oceans are of each
taste, i.e. that taste is not found in any other ocean. They are - Lavana,
Varunod, Kshirodas and Ghritoadas / Bhagavan! How many oceans are naturally of
Udgarasa? Gautama! Three oceans are naturally of Udgarasa, i.e. their water is
like natural water / They are - Kalod, Pushkarod and Swayambhuraman oceans /
Ayushman Shraman! The rest of the oceans are mostly said to be of Kshodarasa
(sugarcane juice).

80] [Jivajovaabhigamsutra Bhagavan! Is there any powerful and influential deva
who can take external pudgals and pierce and then mend the body of a child? Yes,
Gautama! He is capable of doing so. He mends it so skillfully that one cannot
see or know the joint. Such a subtle joint it is. / Bhagavan! Is there any
powerful deva (without taking external pudgals) who can make a child bigger or
smaller without piercing it? Gautama! That is not possible. Thus, the four
bhangs should be said. In the first and second bhangs, there is no taking of
external pudgals, and in the first bhang, there is also no piercing of the
child's body. In the second bhang, there is piercing. In the third bhang, there
is no taking of external pudgals and no piercing of the child's body. / In the
fourth bhang, there is both taking of external pudgals and piercing of the
child's body in the past. One cannot know or see this Siddhi of making it
smaller or bigger. / This method of shortening and lengthening is very subtle.

[Jyotishka Chandra-Suryaadhikār] 181 Those star-like gods who are situated above
the moon and the sun, are they inferior or equal in comparison to the Dhuti
etc.? Yes, Gautama! Some are inferior and some are equal. Bhagavan! Why is it
said that some star-gods are inferior and some are equal? Gautama! Just as there
is excellence or lack of excellence in the rules and Brahmacharya etc. done in
the previous births of those star-like gods, in the same proportion there is
minuteness or equality in them. Therefore, Gautama! It is said that those star-
like gods who are below, in the same category, or above the moon and the sun,
are inferior as well as equal. In each family of the moon and the sun, there are
eighty-eight (88) planets, twenty-eight (28) constellations, and the number of
stars is sixty-six thousand nine hundred seventy-five (66975) Kodakodi. 192. In

the rays of the sun, to the highest point where the stars travel? How far does
it travel in the Surya-vimana? How far does it travel in the Chandra-vimana? How
far does it travel in the sky from the highest point where the stars travel?
Gotama! From the earth, which is illuminated by the rays of the sun, the sun
travels a distance of seven hundred and nine yojanas to the highest point where
the stars travel. It travels a distance of one hundred yojanas in the Surya-
vimana. It travels a distance of eighty yojanas in the Chandra-vimana. It
travels a distance of no yojanas from the highest point where the stars travel.
Bante! How far does the sun travel in the Surya-vimana from the lowest point
where the stars travel? How far does it travel in the Chandra-vimana? How far
does it travel in the sky from the highest point where the stars travel? Gotama!
From the lowest point where the stars travel, the sun travels a distance of ten
yojanas in the Surya-vimana. It travels a distance of nine yojanas in the
Chandra-vimana. It travels a distance of ten yojanas from the highest point
where the stars travel. Bante! How far does the Surya-vimana travel in the

"83. O Bhagavan! How far from the Chandra Vimana does the highest star move?
Gautama! The highest star moves twenty yojanas from the Chandra Vimana. Thus,
the Jyotishka Chakra is said to be one hundred and ten yojanas in thickness and
extends for countless yojanas in the horizontal direction. O Bhagavan! Which
constellation in Jambudvipa moves within all the constellations, outside the
circular motion, and above and below? Gautama! In the island called Jambudvipa,
the Abhijit constellation moves within all the constellations in a circular
motion. The Mula constellation moves outside all the constellations in a
circular motion. The Swati constellation moves above all the constellations, and
the Bharani constellation moves below all the constellations in a circular
motion.  193. O Bhagavan! What is the shape of the Chandra Vimana? Gautama! The
Chandra Vimana is in the shape of an Ardha-Kabitha (half-dome). The Chandra
Vimana is entirely made of crystal, its brilliance spreads in all directions,
making it white and luminous (as if mocking others), etc. This is how the Surya
Vimana, Graha Vimana, and Tara Vimana should be described.  193. O Bhagavan!
What is the length, width, and thickness of the Chandra Vimana? Gautama! The
Chandra Vimana is sixty-six yojanas in length and width, three times that in
thickness, and twenty-eight yojanas in thickness. The Surya Vimana is sixty-six
yojanas in length and width, three times that in thickness, and twenty-four
yojanas in thickness. The Graha Vimana is half a yojana in length and width,
three times that in thickness, and one kosha in thickness. The Nakshatra Vimana

Mula is outside all. Swati is above all, but Bharani is below all. // 1 //"

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):  The four thousand divine
elephants, bearing the form of celestial beings, carry and transport the lunar
celestial chariot towards the south. The description of those elephants is as
follows:  They are white elephants, beautiful, and of excellent splendor. Their
luster is as pure and spotless as conch shells, curdled milk, cow's milk, foam,
and silver. In the beautiful, thick, and sturdy trunks, which have absorbed the
radiance of the lotus-like red gems, there are sometimes seen self-manifested
dots of lotus-like radiance when the elephants are in their youthful state (from
the chest to the trunk).  Their faces are raised high, adorned with large,
restless, and agile ears of pure gold. Their eyes are tri-colored - white,
black, and yellow - like gems, and thus appear as tender buds of the Mallika
flower. Their teeth are white, uniform, strong, mature, firm, complete, and
crystalline, and are adorned with golden rings on their front parts, appearing
as if a heap of pure gems amidst silver.  On their heads are worn ornaments of
pure golden tilaka and other adornments. Around their necks are worn various
gem-made upper garlands. In the center of their cheeks are placed sharp,
beautiful, and pure vajra-like ankushas (hooks) made of vaidurya gems.  Their
backs are well-covered and tightly bound with ropes of pure gold, making them
proud and powerful. They are adorned with large golden bells that emit sweet
sounds, along with small bells made of various gem-stones. Their tails hang down
to their feet, which are round, well-formed, and have beautiful and auspicious
characteristics, with which they constantly groom their bodies.  Despite their
massive limbs, they are swift in their movements. Their nails are made of gem-
stones, and they are shod with pure golden horseshoes. They are obedient, move
gracefully, are pleasing to the mind, are charming, are captivating, have
unlimited speed, and possess unlimited strength, valor, and heroic prowess. With
their deep and captivating trumpeting sounds, they fill the sky and illuminate
the directions.  (In this way, the four thousand elephant-formed deities carry
and transport the lunar celestial chariot towards the south.)

[89 194. (u) And what about the tail of the Surya-vimāna? Gotama! Sixteen
thousand Devas carry it in the direction of the east. And what about the tail of
the Graha-vimāna? Gotama! Eight thousand Devas carry it in the direction of the
east. Two thousand Devas carry it from the east, two thousand Devas carry it
from the south, two thousand Devas carry it from the west, and two thousand
Devas carry it from the north. And what about the tail of the Nakshatra-vimāna?
Gotama! Four thousand Devas carry it in the direction of the east. Ten hundred
Devas, in the form of lions, carry it from the east. In the same way, four
thousand Devas carry it from all four directions. And what about the tail of the
Tara-vimāna? Gotama! Two thousand Devas carry it in the direction of the east.
Five hundred Devas carry it from each of the four directions. 194. (u) The same
question should be asked about the Surya-vimāna. Gotama! Sixteen thousand Devas
carry the Surya-vimāna in the direction of the east. In the same way, when asked
about the Graha-vimāna, the Bhagavan said, "Gotama! Eight thousand Devas carry
the Graha-vimāna. Two thousand Devas carry it from the east, two thousand Devas
carry it from the south, two thousand Devas carry it from the west, and two
thousand Devas carry it from the north. When asked about the Nakshatra-vimāna,
the Bhagavan said, "Gotama! Four thousand Devas carry the Nakshatra-vimāna. One
thousand Devas, in the form of lions, carry it from the east. In the same way,
four thousand Devas carry it from all four directions. In the same way, two
thousand Devas carry the Tara-vimāna. Five hundred Devas carry it from each of
the four directions. 195. Thus, Bhagavan! Which of these, the Chandra, Surya,
Graha, Nakshatra, and Tara, are fast and which are slow? Gotama! The Surya is
faster than the Chandra, the Graha is faster than the Surya, the Nakshatra is
faster than the Graha, and the Tara is faster than the Nakshatra. The Chandra is
the slowest and the Tara is the fastest. Bhagavan! Which of these, the Chandra,
Surya, Graha, Nakshatra, and Tara, are of lesser power and which are of greater
power? Gotama! The Nakshatra is of greater power than the Tara, the Graha is of
greater power than the Nakshatra, the Surya is of greater power than the Graha,
and the Chandra is of greater power than the Surya. The Tara is of the least
power and the Chandra is of the greatest power.

90] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra . 196. (a) Bhagavan! In Jambudvipa, what is the
distance between one star and another star said to be? Gautama! The distance is
of two types, namely - Vyaghatim (artificial) and Nivvaghatim (natural). The
Vyaghatim distance is said to be the least two hundred sixty-six (266) yojanas
and the greatest twelve thousand two hundred forty-two (12242) yojanas. The
Nivvaghatim distance is to be known as the least five hundred dhanus and the
greatest two kosas. (The Nishadha and Neelavant mountains are 250 yojanas long
and wide from their peaks / The constellation moves from both sides of the peak
leaving eight yojanas on each side, therefore, adding 16 to 250 gives the
distance of 266 yojanas / The greatest distance is from the perspective of Meru.
Meru is ten thousand yojanas wide and the constellation moves leaving 1120
yojanas on both sides. In this way, adding 2242 to ten thousand yojanas gives
the greatest distance.) Bhagavan! How many Aggramahisi are there for
Jyotishindra Jyotishraja Chandra? Gautama! There are four Aggramahisi, namely -
Chandraprabha, Jyotsnaabha, Achimali and Prabhankara / Each of these Aggramahisi
can control four thousand other Devis. In this way, the total family of Devis
becomes sixteen thousand. This is the statement of Chandradeva's "Tudia" inner
palace. 196. (a) Bhagavan! Does Chandra, Jyotishraja, reside in the Chandradisa
Vimana, in the Sabha, in the Suhammaa, on the Chandrasimhasana, along with the
Tudia, enjoying divine pleasures? It is not appropriate to say so / Bhagavan!
Why is it said that Chandra, Jyotishraja, does not reside in the Chandradisa
Vimana, in the Sabha, in the Suhammaa, on the Chandrasimhasana, along with the
Tudia, enjoying divine pleasures? Gautama! Jyotishindra Jyotishraja Chandra, in
the Chandradisa Vimana, in the Sabha, in the Suhammaa, on the Manavagamsa, on
the Cheiyakhamba, in the Vairamaesa, in the Golavattasamugga, there are many
Jinasakhanas, which are well-established, as if they are present.

[91]  The Jyotishka Chandra-Surya-Adhikara:  "Gautama, are the Jyotishis, the
Devas and the Devis, who are the Jyotishis, worthy of being worshipped and
served?  Gautama:  Yes, they are.  Because of them, the Jyotishraja Chandra is
not able to enjoy the pleasures of the Chandravatamsaka Vimana, the Chandra
Simhasana, or the Bhoga-Bhoga.  Therefore, it is said that the Jyotishraja
Chandra is not able to enjoy the pleasures of the Chandravatamsaka Vimana, the
Sudharma Sabha, the Chandra Simhasana, or the Bhoga-Bhoga with his inner circle.
Gautama:  Another thing is that the Jyotishraja Chandra is able to enjoy the
pleasures of the Chandravatamsaka Vimana, the Sudharma Sabha, the Chandra
Simhasana, with his four thousand Samanika Devas, sixteen thousand Atmarakshaka
Devas, and many other Jyotishis, Devas, and Devis, by the sound of the dance,
song, music, string instruments, tal, taal, trutit, dhan, and mridanga.  But he
is not able to enjoy the pleasures of the Bhoga-Bhoga with his inner circle.
196. (a)  Bhagavan!  Is the Jyotishkendra Jyotishraja Chandra able to enjoy the
pleasures of the Bhoga-Bhoga with his inner circle in the Chandravatamsaka
Vimana, the Sudharma Sabha, and the Chandra Simhasana?  Gautama:  No, he is not.
Bhagavan!  Why is it said that the Jyotishraja Chandra is not able to enjoy the
pleasures of the Bhoga-Bhoga with his inner circle in the Chandravatamsaka
Vimana, the Sudharma Sabha, and the Chandra Simhasana?  Gautama:  In the
Chandravatamsaka Vimana, the Sudharma Sabha, the Manavaka Chaitya Stambha, and
the Vajmaya Gol Manjusha of the Jyotishkendra Jyotishraja Chandra, there are
many bones of the Jinas, which are worthy of being worshipped and served by the
Jyotishkendra Jyotishraja Chandra and many other Jyotishis, Devas, and Devis.
Because of them, the Jyotishraja Chandra is not able to enjoy the pleasures of
the Chandravatamsaka Vimana, the Chandra Simhasana, or the Bhoga-Bhoga.
Therefore, it is said that the Jyotishraja Chandra is not able to enjoy the
pleasures of the Bhoga-Bhoga with his inner circle in the Chandravatamsaka
Vimana, the Sudharma Sabha, and the Chandra Simhasana.  Gautama:  Another thing
is that the Jyotishraja Chandra is able to enjoy the pleasures of the Bhoga-
Bhoga with his four thousand Samanika Devas, sixteen thousand Atmarakshaka
Devas, and many other Jyotishis, Devas, and Devis, by the sound of the dance,
song, music, string instruments, tal, taal, trutit, dhan, and mridanga.  But he
is not able to enjoy the pleasures of the Bhoga-Bhoga with his inner circle.
196. (b)  Bhagavan!  How many Aggamahisis does the Jyotishkendra Jyotishraja
Surya have?  Gautama:  He has four Aggamahisis, whose names are Suryaprabha,
Patpabha, Achimali, and Prabhankara.  Similarly, in the Suryadiasa Vimana, the
Surya Simhasana, and all the other Grahas, there are four Aggamahisis, whose
names are Vijaya, Vejayanti, Jayanti, and Aparaiya.  They are also the same.
196. (c)  Bhagavan!  How many Aggamahisis does the Jyotishkendra Jyotishraja
Chandra have?  Gautama:  He has four Aggamahisis, whose names are Chandraprabha,
Patpabha, Achimali, and Prabhankara.  Similarly, in the Chandradiasa Vimana, the
Chandra Simhasana, and all the other Grahas, there are four Aggamahisis, whose
names are Vijaya, Vejayanti, Jayanti, and Aparaiya.  They are also the same.
196. (d)  Bhagavan!  How many Aggamahisis does the Jyotishkendra Jyotishraja

Patpabha, Achimali, and Prabhankara.  Similarly, in the Suryadiasa Vimana, the

[92] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra Prabhankara / The remaining statement should be told
like the moon. The special feature is that it should be told on the Sun throne
in the Suryavataska plane. In the same way, there are four Anamhishiyas of the
planets etc. - Vijaya, Vejayanti, Jayanti and Aparajita / The previous statement
should be made in relation to them. 197. In the Chandra Vimana, O Venerable! How
many states of the gods are said? In this way, according to the state-word in
the proclamation, the state should be told up to the star-form. O Venerable! In
these Moon, Sun, planets, constellations and stars, who is less, more, equal or
superior to whom? Gautama! These two, Moon and Sun, are equal and the least. The
constellations are countless times more than them. The planets are countless
times more than them, and the stars are countless times more than them. The
Jyotishka Uddeshaka is complete. 197. Bhagavan! In the Chandra Vimana, how many
states of the Devas are said? In this way, according to the state-word in the
proclamation, the state should be told up to the star-form. Bhagavan! In these
Chandra, Surya, Graha, Nakshatra and Taragons, who is less, more, equal or
superior to whom? Gautama! Chandra and Surya are both equal and the least. The
Nakshatras are countless times more than them. The Grahas are countless times
more than them, and the Taraganas are countless times more than them. The
Jyotishka Uddeshaka is complete. Discussion - The present Sutra informs about
the state-word of the proclamation in relation to the state. It is as follows:
In the Chandra Vimana, the inferior state of Chandra, Samanik Devas and
Atmarakshak Devas is one-fourth of the Palyopama and the superior state is one
thousand years more than one Palyopama. Here, the state of the Devis is one-
fourth of the Palyopama and the superior state is five hundred years more than
half a Palyopama. In the Suryavimana, the inferior state of the Devas is one
Palyopama and the superior state is one thousand years more than one Palyopama.
Here, the state of the Devis is inferior to the Palyopama and the superior state
is five hundred years more than half a Palyopama. The inferior state of the
Devas in the Graha Vimana is one Palyopama and the superior state is one
Palyopama. Here, the state of the Devis is one-fourth of the Palyopama and the
superior state is half a Palyopama. In the Nakshatra Vimana, the inferior state
of the Devas is three Palyopama and the superior state is one Palyopama. Here,
the state of the Devis is inferior to the Palyopama and the superior state is
slightly more than the Palyopama. In the Tara Vimana, the inferior state of the
Devas is one Palyopama and the superior state is three Palyopama. The state of
the Devis is inferior to one Palyopama and the superior state is slightly more
than a part of the Palyopama. ||Jyotishka Uddeshaka is complete||

##  **Vāimānika Uddeshaka Vāimānika-Vaktavyatā 198**  **198.**  "Where, Bhante,
are the vimānas of the Vāimānika Devas spoken of? Where, Bhante, do the
Vāimānika Devas reside?"  As it is said in the Sthānapada of the Prajñāpanā
Sūtra, so it should be said here.  Specifically, here one should also mention
the Pariṣadās up to the Acyuta Vimāna, as well as the many Sāudharmakalpavāsi
Devas and Devīs who reside there.  **Commentary:** This Sūtra refers to the
information in the Sthānapada of the Prajñāpanā Sūtra.  It is necessary to
include it here for clarity of the subject.  It is as follows:  "Above the
multi-splendid land of this Ratnaprabhā-Pṛthvī, beyond many yojanas, many
thousands of yojanas, many lakhs of yojanas, many crores of yojanas, and many
koṭikoṭi yojanas, are the Sāudharma, Iśāna, Sanatkumāra, Mahendra, Brahmaloka,
Lāntaka, Mahāśukra, Sahasrāra, Prāṇata, Pāraṇa, Acyuta, Graiveyaka, and Anuttara
Vimānas, where reside eighty-four lakh seventy-nine thousand twenty-two Vimānas
and Vimānāvāsa of the Vāimānika Devas.  These Vimānas are as clear as crystal,
smooth, soft, polished, free from dust, pure, free from mud, radiant, luminous,
prosperous, shining, joyful, beautiful, and pleasing.  Many Vāimānika Devas
reside in them.  They are the Sāudharma, Iśāna, Sanatkumāra, Mahendra,
Brahmaloka, Lāntaka, Mahāśukra, Sahasrāra, Prāṇata, Pāraṇa, Acyuta, nine
Graiveyaka, and five Anuttaroppapātika Devas.  They, from Sāudharma to Acyuta,
are adorned with crowns bearing the marks of: 1. Mṛga, 2. Mahiṣa, 3. Varāha, 4.
Simha, 5. Bakara (Chhagala), 6. Dara, 7. Haya, 8. Gajrāja, 9. Bhajanga, 10.

in virtue, and great in happiness.  Their chests are adorned with necklaces.

In the [Bahalya etc. exposition], the Vimana-Prithvi is twenty-six hundred
yojanas thick. In the Brahmaloka and Lantaka, it is twenty-five hundred yojanas
thick. In the Mahashukra and Sahasrar, it is twenty-four hundred yojanas thick.
In the Aranat, Pranat, Parana, and Achyut kalpas, the Vimana-Prithvi is twenty-
three hundred yojanas thick. In the Aveyaka, the Vimana-Prithvi is twenty-two
hundred yojanas thick. In the Anuttara Vimana, the Vimana-Prithvi is twenty-one
hundred yojanas thick. Bhagavan! How high are the Vimana in the Saudharma-Ishana
kalpa? Gautama! They are five hundred yojanas high. In the Sanatkumara and
Mahendra, they are six hundred yojanas high. In the Brahmaloka and Lantaka, they
are seven hundred yojanas high. In the Mahashukra and Sahasrar, they are eight
hundred yojanas high. In the Pranat, Parana, Aranat, and Achyut, they are nine
hundred yojanas high. In the Graveyaka Vimana, they are ten hundred yojanas
high. And the Anuttara Vimana is said to be eleven hundred yojanas high. 201 (a)
Bhagavan! In the Saudharma-Ishana kalpa, how are the Vimana classified? Gautama!
They are classified in two ways: 1. Avaliya-Pravista and 2. Pravaliya-Bahya. Of
those that are Avaliya-Pravista, they are classified in three ways: 1. Vatta, 2.
Tansa, and 3. Chauransa. Of those that are Avaliya-Bahya, they are classified
according to their knowledge. This continues up to the Graveyaka Vimana. The
Anuttara-Upavaiya Vimana is classified in two ways: 1. Batte and 2. Tansa.
Bhagavan! In the Saudharma-Ishana kalpa, how are the Vimana classified in terms
of their base and diameter, and how are they classified in terms of their
circumference? Gautama! They are classified in two ways: 1. Sankhejjaviththada
and 2. Asankhejjaviththada. Just as in the Paraga, so too up to the Anuttara-
Upavaiya, they are Sankhejjaviththada and Asankhejjaviththada. Of those that are
Sankhejjaviththada, they are the size of Jambudvipa. The Asankhejjaviththada are
classified in terms of their circumference as being as many as countless
yojanas. Bhagavan! In the Saudharma-Ishana kalpa, what colors are the Vimana?
Gautama! They are classified in five colors: 1. Kina, 2. Nila, 3. Lohiya, 4.
Halidda, and 5. Sukkila. In the Sanatkumara-Mahendra, they are classified in
four colors: Nila up to Sukkila. In the Brahmaloka-Lantaka, they are classified
in three colors: Lohiya up to Sukkila. In the Mahashukra-Sahasrar, they are
classified in two colors: Halidda and Sukkila. In the Pranat-Parana-Aranat-
Achyut, they are Sukkila. The Graveyaka Vimana are Sukkila. The Anuttara-
Upavaiya Vimana are classified as being of the most excellent Sukkila color.
Bhagavan! In the Saudharma-Ishana kalpa, how are the Vimana classified in terms
of their light? Gautama! They are classified as being of the Nitchaloya,
Nitchujjoya, and Sayamphaba light, up to the Anuttara-Upavaiya Vimana, which are
classified as being of the Nitchaloya, Nitchujjoya, and Sayamphaba light.
Bhagavan! In the Saudharma-Ishana kalpa, how are the Vimana classified in terms
of their fragrance? Gautama! They are classified as having the fragrance of the
Agaru wood, up to the Anuttara Vimana. Bhagavan! In the Saudharma-Ishana kalpa,
how are the Vimana classified in terms of their touch? They are classified as
having the touch of the Pai, Rue, and Sancha, up to the Anuttara-Upavaiya
Vimana. 201 (a) Bhagavan! In the Saudharma-Ishana kalpa, how are the Vimana
described in terms of their shape? Gautama! They are of two types: 1. Avaliya-
Pravista and 2. Pravaliya-Bahya. Those that are

---------------------------
The **Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra** describes **Pravalika-Pravisht** (row-aligned)
**Vimanas** as being of three types: 1. **Gola** (round), 2. **Trikon**
(triangular), and 3. **Chatushkon** (quadrilateral).  **Pravalika-Bahya**
(external) Vimanas are of various types.  The same statement should be made for
**Veyak-Vimanas**.  **Anuttaropapattik** Vimanas are of two types: **Gola** and
**Trikon**.  **Lord!** What are the length and width of the Vimanas in the
**Saudharma-Ishana Kalpa**?  **Gautama!** These Vimanas are of two types: those
with a **Sankhyat Yojana** (countable yojana) extent and those with an
**Asankhyat Yojana** (uncountable yojana) extent.    Just as the **Narakas**
(hells) have been described, so too should the **Anuttaropapattik Vimanas** be
described as being of two types: those with a **Sankhyat Yojana** extent and
those with an **Asankhyat Yojana** extent.  Those with a **Sankhyat Yojana**
extent are the size of **Jambudvipa**, and those with an **Asankhyat Yojana**
extent are said to have an extent and circumference of **Asankhyat** thousands
of **Yojanas**.  **Lord!** What are the colors of the Vimanas in the
**Saudharma-Ishana Kalpa**?  **Gautama!** The Vimanas are of all five colors:
**Krishna** (black), **Neela** (blue), **Lal** (red), **Pila** (yellow), and
**Shukla** (white).  In the **Sanatkumar** and **Mahendra Kalpas**, the Vimanas
are of four colors: **Neela** to **Shukla**.  In the **Brahmaloka** and
**Lantank Kalpas**, the Vimanas are of three colors: **Lal** to **Shukla**.  In
the **Mahashaka** and **Sahasrar Kalpas**, the Vimanas are of two colors:
**Pila** and **Shukla**.  In the **Panat**, **Pranat**, **Parana**, and **Achyut
Kalpas**, the Vimanas are **Shukla** (white).  **Veyak-Vimanas** are also
**Shukla**.  **Anuttaropapattik Vimanas** are of the **Param-Shukla** (supreme
white) color.  **Lord!** What is the **Prabha** (radiance) of the Vimanas in the
**Saudharma-Ishana Kalpa**?  **Gautama!** These Vimanas are eternally radiant
with their own **Prabha** and eternally luminous.  The same should be said for
**Anuttaropapattik Vimanas**.  **Lord!** What is the **Gandha** (smell) of the
Vimanas in the **Saudharma-Ishana Kalpa**?  **Gautama!** Their smell is even
more pleasant than the smell of fragrant substances like **Kosthapudha**
(sandalwood).  The same should be said for **Anuttara-Vimanas**.  **Lord!** What
is the **Sparsha** (touch) of the Vimanas in the **Saudharma-Ishana Kalpa**?
**Gautama!** Their touch should be like the soft touch of **Ajin** (leather),
**Charma** (skin), or **Ruyi** (cotton).  The same should be said for
**Anuttaropapattik Vimanas**.  **Lord!** In the **Sohma-Isana Kalpas**, how are
the Vimanas situated?  **Gautama!** In **Jambudvipa**, there are two
**Savvadova-Samuddas** (oceans) and the **Gama** (city) extends up to the
**Chhammasa** (six months) and the **Vimanas** are situated up to the
**Atthagaiya** (eight months).  The **Anuttaropapattik Vimanas** are situated up
to the **Atthagaiya**, and beyond that, there are no Vimanas.  **Lord!** In the
**Sohma-Isana Kalpas**, what are the Vimanas made of?  **Gautama!** They are
made of **Savvarayana** (all kinds of materials).  Many **Jivas** (living
beings) and **Poggala** (liberated souls) wander, move about, gather, and
disperse there.  The Vimanas are **Sasa** (with doors) up to the
**Phasaprajjava** (a type of Vimana) and **Asasa** (without doors) up to the
**Anuttaropapattik Vimanas**.  **Lord!** In the **Sohma-Isana Kalpas**, how do
the **Devas** (gods) move about?  **Gautama!** They move about in the same way
as the **Tiryamana** (animals), **Manushya** (humans), and **Panchidia** (birds)
in the **Sammuchhima** (middle world), except that they move about in a
**Vakkatima** (straight line) up to the **Anuttaropapattik Vimanas**.

[Exposition of Bahulya etc.] [105] Gautama! How many devas are born at one time
in the Saudharma and Isana realms? Gautama! At the minimum, one, two or three,
and at the maximum, countable or innumerable are born. This is up to the
Sahasrara realm. In the Pranata and other four realms, and in the Anuttara
realms, one, two or three, at the maximum, countable or innumerable are born.
Bhante! In the Saudharma and Isana realms, for how many kalpas do the devas keep
emerging and disappearing from time to time? Gautama! They keep emerging and
disappearing from time to time for innumerable upaspinis and avasarpinis, but
they are never exhausted, up to the Sahasrara realm. The same is the case for
the four Pranata realms, the Vaikriyika realms, and the Anuttara realms.
Bhagavan! How large are the vimanas in the Saudharma and Isana realms? Gautama!
The vimanas are said to be so large that a deva who can circumambulate the
entire Jambudvipa, which is 21 yojanas in length and breadth and more than 3
lakh yojanas in circumference, in six months with exceptional speed, can reach,
pass through, and not pass through only some of the vimanas. Similarly, it
should be understood for the Vaikriyika and Anuttara realms.  Bhagavan! Of what
are the vimanas in the Saudharma and Isana realms made? Gautama! They are made
of all kinds of precious substances. Many beings and pudgalas are born, fall
away, congregate, and grow in them. The vimanas are eternal from the perspective
of the dravyarthikanaya, but non-eternal from the perspective of the
paryayarthikanaya. The same should be understood for the Anuttaropapata vimanas.
Bhagavan! From where do the devas in the Saudharma and Isana realms arise?
Gautama! Excluding the sammuchchhima beings, the remaining pancendriya tiryañcas
and humans become prakrta and are born as devas in Saudharma and Isana. This
should be stated here as per the sixth vyutkriantipada of the Prajñapana. (Up to
the Sahasrara devaloka, they are born in this manner, and further, only from
humans.) The same should be stated for the Anuttaropapata vimanas as per the
vyutkriantipada.  Bhagavan! How many devas are born at one time in the Saudharma
and Isana realms? Gautama! At the minimum, one, two or three, and at the
maximum, countable or innumerable beings are born. This should be stated up to
the Sahasrara devaloka. In the Pranata and other four realms, the Nava-
graivayas, and the Anuttara vimanas, at the minimum, one, two or three, up to
the maximum countable beings are born.  Bhagavan! If one deva is taken away or
removed from the Saudharma and Isana realms at each moment, in how much time can
they be emptied? Gautama! They are innumerable, so even if one deva is taken
away at each moment, the process of removal will continue for innumerable
utsarpinis and avasarpinis, yet they cannot be emptied. This statement should be
made up to the Sahasrara devaloka. The same for the Pranata and other four
realms, the Vaikriyika realms, and the Anuttara vimanas.

In response to the question regarding the arrival of Jiva, it should be said
that they are countless. Therefore, even if the process of taking away one at a
time continues until the countless part of the Palopam, their removal cannot be
completed. (This removal never happened, will not happen, it is only a figment
of imagination to tell the number.) 201. (E) In the Sohammisanes, O Venerable!
What is the nature of the bodies of the gods in the Kalpas? Gotama! The nature
of the body is twofold, namely, Bhavadharanija and Uttaraveumbiya. / There, the
Bhavadharanija is as many parts of an angula as there are countless, and in
terms of height, it is seventy yojanas. There, the Uttaraveumbiya is as many
parts of an angula as there are countless, and in terms of height, it is a
hundred thousand yojanas. / Thus, one by one, until the last one is a yojana.
There is no Uttaraveumbiya body for the last Bhavadharanija. / In the
Sohammisanes, O Venerable! What is the nature of the bodies of the gods in terms
of their assembly? Gotama! The nature of the assembly is sixfold. / There is no
end, no beginning, no assembly; those beings who are desired, until they reach
this assembly, they become until they reach the last. / In the Sohammisanes, O
Venerable! What is the nature of the bodies of the gods in terms of their
structure? Gotama! The body is twofold, Bhavadharanija and Uttaraveumbiya. /
There, the Bhavadharanija is of the nature of the structure of the
Samachauransa, / There, the Uttaraveumbiya is of the nature of the structure of
the Nana, until it reaches the last. The last Bhavadharanija is of the nature of
the structure of the Samachauransa, there is no Uttaraveumbiya. / In the
Sohammisanes, what is the nature of the gods in terms of their color? Gotama!
They are of the color of Kanagatayarattama. In the Sanankumaramahide, they are
of the color of Paumpapamhagora. In the Brahmaloka, O Venerable! Gotama! They
are of the color of Allamadugavannabha. / Thus, until the last, / They are of
the color of Paramasukilla, which is the last. In the Sohammisanes, O Venerable!
What is the nature of the bodies of the gods in the Kalpas in terms of their
smell? Gotama! They are of the smell of the earth, like the smell of a
Kothupuda, and also of the smell of all the Manamataraga. Until the last. / In
the Sohammisanes, O Venerable! What is the nature of the bodies of the gods in
terms of their touch? Gotama! They are of the touch of
Thiramauyanisukumalachavi, and so on, until the last. / What is the nature of
the beings who become Ussasatta in the Sohammisanes? Gotama! Those beings who
are desired, until they reach this, become Ussasatta, until they reach the last;
thus, they also become Praharatta, until they reach the last. What are the
Leasas of the Sohammisanes? Gotama! They are of one Teuleassa. In the
Sanankumaramahide, they are of one Pamhaleassa. Thus, in the Brahmaloka, they
are of one Pamha, and in the rest, they are of one Sukkaleassa; the last ones
are of one Paramasukkaleassa. What are the Sambhatthi, Micchaditthi, and
Sammamichchavitthi of the Sohammisanes? They are of three kinds, until the last,
the Gevejjades, they are of Sammavitthi, Micchavitthi, and Sammamichchavitthi. /
The last ones are of Sammavitthi, neither Micchaditthi nor Sammamichchaditthi.

201. (E) Bhagavan! Soudharma and Isan kalpa mein devon ke sharir ki avagahana
kitni hai? Gautam! Unke do prakar ke sharir hote hain -bhavadharaniy and
uttarvaikriy, unmein bhavadharaniy sharir ko avagahana jghanya se angul ka
asankhyatvaan bhaag aur utkrisht se sat hath hai. Uttravaikriy sharir ki apeksha
se jghanya angul ka sankhyatvaan bhaag aur utkrisht ek lakh yojan hai. Is prakar
aage-aage ke kalpon mein ek-ek hath kam karte jana chahiye, yavat
anuttaropapathik devon ki ek hath ki avagahana rah jati hai / (Jaise Sanatkumar-
Mahendra kalpa mein utkrisht bhavadharaniy sharir ki avagahana chhah hath
praman, Brahmalok-Lantk mein panch hath, Mahashukra-Sahasrar mein char hath,
Pranat-Pranat-Paran-Achyut mein tin hath, Navgraiveyak mein do hath aur Anantar
vimanon mein ek hath praman avagahana hai.) Graiveykon aur Anuttara vimanon mein
kewal bhavadharaniy sharir hota hai / Ve dev uttarvikriya nahin karte /
Bhagavan! Soudharma-Isan kalpa mein devon ke sharir ka sanhanan kaunsa hai?
Gautam! Chhah sanhananon mein se ek bhi sanhanan unmein nahin hota; kyonki unke
sharir mein na haddi hoti hai, na shiraen hoti hain aur na nasen hi hoti hain.
Atah ve asanhanni hain. Jo pudgal isht, kant yavat manojn-manam hote hain, ve
unke sharir roop mein ektrit hokar thatharoop mein parinat hote hain / Yahi
kathn anuttaropapathik devon tak kahna chahiye. Bhagavan! Soudharma-Isan kalpa
mein devon ke sharir ka sansthan kaisa hai? Gautam! Unke sharir do prakar ke
hain- bhavadharaniy aur uttarvaikriy / Jo bhavadharaniy sharir hai, uska
samchaturasrasansthan hai aur jo uttarvakriy sharir hai, unka sansthan (aakar)
nana prakar ka hota hai. Yah kathn Achyut devlok tak kahna chahiye. Praiveyak
aur Anuttara vimanon ke dev uttar-vikurvana nahin karte / Unka bhavadharaniy
sharir samchaturasrasansthan wala hai. Uttravikriya vahan nahin hai. Bhagavan!
Soudharma-Isan ke devon ke sharir ka varn kaisa hai? Gautam! Tape hue svarn ke
saman lal abhayukt unka varn hai. Sanatkumar aur Mahendra kalpa ke devon ka varn
padma, kamal ke parag (keshar) ke saman gaur hai. Brahmalok ke dev gile mahue ke
varn vale (safed) hain / Isi prakar graiveyak devon tak safed varn kahna chahiye
/ Anuttaropapathik devon ke sharir ka varn parmashukla hai. Bhagavan! Soudharma-
Isan kalpon ke devon ke sharir ki gandh kaisi hai? Gautam! Jaise kosthaput adi
sugandhit dravyo ki sugandh hoti hai, usse bhi adhik isht, kant yavat manam unke
sharir ki gandh hoti hai. Anuttaropapathik devon paryant aisa hi kathn karna
chahiye.

10] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra Bhagavan! How is the touch of the bodies of the gods
of the Saudharma-Ishaan kalpas described? Gautama! Their bodies are described as
having a stable, soft, smooth and supple image.  /  The same should be said for
the Anuttaroppapatik Devas. Bhagavan! How do pudgalas transform into the breath
of the Saudharma-Ishaan Devas? Gautama! The pudgalas that are desirable,
radiant, pleasing, attractive and delightful, they transform into their breath.
This statement should be said up to the Anuttaroppapatik Devas and the same
should be known about the pudgalas that transform into their food. This
statement should be understood up to the Anuttaroppapatik Devas. Bhagavan! How
many leshyas do the Devas of the Saudharma-Ishaan Devaloka have? Gautama! They
have only one Tejo leshya. Sanatkumar and Mahendra have one Padma leshya,
Brahmaloka also has Pala leshya. The rest all have only Shukla leshya.  /  The
Anuttaroppapatik Devas have Paramshukla leshya. Bhagavan! Are the Devas of the
Saudharma-Ishaan kalpa Samyagdristi, Mithyadristi or Samyagmithyadristi?  _
Gautama! They are of all three types.  /  The Devas up to the Aveyaka Vimanas
are of all three types - Samyagdristi, Mithyadristi and Mishradristi.  /  The
Devas of the Anuttar Vimanas are only Samyagdristi, not Mithyadristi or
Mishradristi. Bhagavan! Are the Devas of the Saudharma-Ishaan kalpa
knowledgeable or ignorant? Gautama! They are of both types.  /  Those who are
knowledgeable are, by rule, those with three knowledges and those who are
ignorant are, by rule, those with three ignorances. This statement should be
made up to the Greveyaka Vimanas. The Anuttaroppapatik Devas are only
knowledgeable - not ignorant. In this way, there is a rule of three knowledges
and three ignorances up to the Aveyaka Devas. The Anuttaroppapatik Devas are
only knowledgeable - not ignorant. They always have three knowledges by rule. In
the same way, three yogas and two uses should also be said about those Devas.
From Saudharma-Ishaan to Anuttaroppapatik, all Devas have three yogas and two
uses. Avadhikshetraadi Prarupan 202. In the Saudharma-Ishaan, how much field do
the Devas know and see? Gotama! As much as an angula's countless parts, upwards
as much as the earth of the rayan prabha, upwards as much as the Sai Vimanas,
sideways as much as countless days and oceans. Thus, the blue, black, and white
leshyas are in the bhavanavantara. The Saudharma-Ishaan leshyas are to be
considered.  // 1 //  In the Kappe, Sanatkumar, Mahendra, and Brahmaloka, there
is one Padma leshya, and beyond that, there is Shukla leshya.  // 2 //

## 112] The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra are as graceful as the moon, with foreheads
like the crescent moon. They are the very embodiment of adornment and wear
beautiful garments. They are beautiful to behold, bring joy, and are symbols of
beauty. Those with unblemished bodies possess natural beauty without adornments
or clothing. Except for the Saudharma-Ishana Kalpa, the remaining Kalpas have
only Devas, no Devis. Therefore, the description of the Devas' adornment up to
the Achyuta Kalpa should be done according to the aforementioned method.   What
is the adornment of the Praveya Devas? In response to this question, it is said,
"Gautama! Those Devas are devoid of adornments and clothing, they are endowed
with natural adornment. There are no Devis there." Similarly, the description of
the adornment of the Anuttara-Vimana Devas should also be stated.   "Bhagavan!
How do the Devas in the Saudharma-Ishana Kalpa experience sensual pleasures
while moving about?"   "Gautama! They experience pleasure arising from desirable
words, desirable forms, and desirable touch."   This should be stated in the
same way for the Praveya Devas. The Devas of the Anuttara-Vimana experience
pleasure arising from Anuttara words and Anuttara touch. The state of all
Vaimanika Devas should be described, and it should be stated where they are born
after being liberated from the Deva-Bhava, this is called the Udvartana-Dwar.
The discussion in the aforementioned Sutra only mentions the state and
Udvartana. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify it briefly here. The state is
as follows:  **Kalpa** | **Name** | **Lowest State** | **Highest State** -------
| -------- | -------- | -------- Saudharma Kalpa | Ishana Kalpa | 1 Palya-Upam |
1 Palya-Upam +  Sanatkumara Kalpa | Maheendra Kalpa | 2 Sagara-Upam | 2 Sagara-

[114] "Gautama, the [jiva-jiva-abhigamsutra] has been produced many times or an
infinite number of times. In the remaining kalpas, it should be said in the same
way, but it should not be said that they are born as goddesses (because there
are no goddesses in the planes before Saudharma-Ishana). It should be said up to
the Graveyaka planes. In the Anuttaroppapatik planes, it should be said as
before, but not in the form of gods and goddesses. Here the statement of the
gods is complete.  Discussion: Here the question has been asked that in each of
the thirty-two lakh planes of the Saudharma Devaloka, have all beings, ghosts,
jivas and satvas been born before in the form of earth, gods, goddesses and
bhandopkaran? (The two-sensed, three-sensed and four-sensed have been included
in the pranas, the plants in the bhutas, the five-sensed in the jivas and the
rest, earth-up-tejas-vayu, have been included in the satvas). In answer, it has
been said that they have been born many times or an infinite number of times.
Under the practical amount, jivas have been born an infinite number of times in
almost all places.  Here, in many copies, the text "Pudhvikayattae Jav Vanassa
Ikaiyattae" is available. But according to the Vrittikara, this is not
consistent. Because there is a lack of tejas there. According to the Vrittikara,
only "Prithvikaiyataya Devataya Devitaya" is the appropriate mention. Asana,
shayan, yavat bhandopkaran, etc. are included in the prithvikaayik jivas. There
are goddesses only up to the Saudharma-Ishana kalpa, therefore, it should not be
said that they are born in the form of goddesses in the later planes. The
prohibition of being born in the form of goddesses has been made up to the
Veyaka planes. In the Anuttaravimanas, both the form of goddesses and the form
of gods are prohibited. There are no goddesses there. The prohibition of gods
has been made because in the four planes of Vijaya, etc., a jiva can go only
twice due to progress, and only once in the Sarvarthasiddha plane, not an
infinite number of times. The prohibition should be understood from the point of
view of not going an infinite number of times. Here the description of the gods
ends.  Generally, the description of bhavashthiti, etc. is as follows:  206.

Generally, the description of the state of existence, etc. [115 AS] "Thus,
Venerable Sir! How many times are the Niryayikas, humans, and Devas, less, more,
equal, or superior to each other? Gautama! Humans are the least, Niryayikas are
countless times more than them, Devas are countless times more than Niryayikas,
and Tiryanchas are infinite times more than Devas. Thus, the description of the
four types of Samsara-ending beings is complete. 206. Venerable Sir! What is the
state of the Niryayikas? Gautama! The lowest is ten thousand years and the
highest is thirty-three Sagaropama. In this way, one should ask questions about
everyone. / The lowest state of the Tiryanchas is Antarmuhurta and the highest
is three Palyopama. The same applies to humans. The state of the Devas should be
known to be the same as that of the Niryayikas. The state of the Devas and
Niryayikas is their Sanchittana, i.e., Kayasthiti. / (The same, the same Bhava,
the time of birth is called Kayasthiti. /) The Kayasthiti of the Tiryanchas is
the lowest Antarmuhurta and the highest is Vanaspatikala. Venerable Sir! How
long can a human remain as a human? Gautama! The lowest is Antarmuhurta and the
highest is three Palyopama plus Purvakotiprithaktva. The difference between
Niryayikas, humans, and Devas is the lowest Antarmuhurta and the highest is
Vanaspatikala. The difference between the Tiryanchas is the lowest Antarmuhurta
and the highest is two hundred to nine hundred Sagaropama. Venerable Sir! Among
these Niryayikas and Devas, who is less, more, equal, or superior to whom?
Gautama! Humans are the least, Niryayikas are countless times more than them,
Devas are countless times more than Niryayikas, and Tiryanchas are infinite
times more than Devas. Thus, the description of the four types of Samsara-ending
beings is complete. Discussion - After the description of the Devas, the state,
Sanchittana (Kayasthiti), difference, and less-moreness of Niryayikas,
Tiryanchas, humans, and Devas are collectively mentioned in this Sutra. / The
lowest state of the Niryayikas is ten thousand years and the highest is thirty-
three Sagaropama. / The lowest state should be understood in relation to the
first stone of the Ratnaprabha Naraka and the highest state should be understood
in relation to the seventh Naraka-Prithvi. / The lowest state of the Tiryanchas
is Antarmuhurta and the highest is three Palyopama. This is in relation to
Devakuru, etc. Humans also have the lowest Antarmuhurta and the highest three
Palyopama state. The Devas are said to have the lowest ten thousand years -
Bhavanapati and Vyantara Devas and the highest thirty-three Sagaropama - Vijaya,
etc. Vimanas. / This is the state of existence. / The meaning of Sanchittana is
Kayasthiti. / That is, how long a being can remain in the same Bhava. / The
state of existence of the Niryayikas and Devas is their Kayasthiti. / Because it
is a rule that a Deva does not become a Deva in the next Bhava after death, nor
does a Niryayika become a Niryayika in the next Bhava after death. ' 1. "No

[116] The term "Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra" is used because the state of existence
of gods and hell beings is the same as the "Sanchittana" (state of body) of the
"Tiryanch" (non-human beings) for a very short period of time, because after
death they can be born as humans or other beings. Their "Sanchittana" from the
highest state is for an infinite period of time, because birth and death can
occur in plants for an infinite period of time. The meaning of "infinite time"
here is the "Vanaspatikala" (plant time). The proof of "Vanaspatikala" is as
follows: from time, infinite "Utsapini" (ascending) and "Pravasapini"
(descending) are proof, from space, infinite "Lokas" (worlds) and countless
"Pudgal Paravart" (transformation of matter) are proof. These "Pudgal Paravart"
should be understood as the number of time units in the countless parts of the
"Avalika" (covering). The "Sanchittana" of a human being is from the lowest
state to a very short period of time. After death, they can be born as
"Tiryanch" or other beings. The "Sanchittana" from the highest state is more
than three "Palya" (moments). It should be understood in relation to the seven
human births (of the "Purvakoti Prayu") in "Mahavideha" (great body) etc., and
the eighth birth in "Devakuru" (heavenly beings) etc. "Antar-Dwar" (interval) is
the time period after which a being dies in one state and is reborn in the same
state. The "Antar" of a "Naireyik" (hell being) is from a very short period of
time to "Vanaspatikala". It is in relation to the expectation of being born as a
"Tiryanch" or human being for a very short period of time after leaving hell and
then becoming a hell being again. A being is born as a human being from the
womb, is complete in all "Paryapti" (perfections), is endowed with special
knowledge, is "Vaikriya-Labdhiman" (possessor of the power of transformation),
desires a kingdom etc., knows the trouble of "Parachari" (enemy), and with the
power of his strength, defeats the four-armed army, engages in battle, meditates
on "Maharoudra-Dhyana" (meditation on the great wrath), and dies in the womb and
is born in hell. In this expectation, the "Naireyik" being is born again in hell
after a very short period of time in the human state. After leaving hell, it is
born as a "Tandula-Matsya" (fish that eats rice), becomes a "Maharoudra-Dhyana"
meditator, lives for a very short period of time, and is born again in hell. In
this expectation, the lowest "Antar" of being born as a "Tiryanch" and then
being born again in hell should be understood as a very short period of time.
The highest "Antar" occurs when it is born in hell after an infinite period of
birth and death in plants. The lowest "Antar" of "Tiryanch" is a very short
period of time. It is in relation to the expectation of a "Tiryanch" dying and
being born as a human being for a very short period of time and then being born
again as a "Tiryanch". The highest "Antar" is slightly more than "Sagaropama-
Shat-Prithaktva" (hundred times the size of the ocean). It occurs when it
continuously wanders in the states of gods, hell beings, and humans for two
hundred to nine hundred times the size of the ocean. The lowest "Antar" of a
human being is a very short period of time, and the highest "Antar" is
"Vanaspatikala". The lowest "Antar" occurs when it leaves the human state and
lives in the "Tiryanch" state for a very short period of time and then becomes a
human being again. The highest "Antar" is "Vanaspatikala", which is clear. The
lowest "Antar" of gods is a very short period of time. A being leaves the state
of gods and is born as a human being from the womb, is complete in all
"Paryapti", is endowed with special knowledge, and while listening to the
religious teachings of "Shraman" (Jain monk) or "Shramanopasak" (follower of a
Jain monk), meditates on "Dharma-Dhyana" (meditation on religion), and is born
in the state of gods while still in the womb. In this expectation, the lowest
"Antar" occurs for a very short period of time. The highest "Antar" is
"Vanaspatikala".

Generally, the description of the state of existence, etc. [117], which occurs
when one becomes a deva after taking birth and death in the plant kingdom for an
infinite period of time. The **alpabahutva** in the **alpabahutva** context
refers to the fewest number of humans. Because they are equal to the number of
**akashapradeshas** in the **asanख्येयभागवर्ती** regions of the **shreni**. They
are **nairyika** by **asanख्येयguna**, because they are equal to the number of
**akashapradeshas** in the **shreni** that are equal to the number of
**pradeshas** obtained by multiplying the first square root of the number of
**pradeshas** in a region the size of an **angulamaatra** by the second square
root. The **devas** are **asanख्येयguna** more than the **nairyikas**, because
the **vyantar** and **jyotishka devas** in the **mahadaṇḍaka** are said to be
**asanख्यatguna** more than the **narakas**. The **tiryach** are **anantaguna**

**207.  The Fourth Pratyapatti with Five Titharas**  Those who teach that there
are five types of *samsara* -bound beings, describe them as follows:
*Ekeindriya*, *Dveindriya*, *Treindriya*, *Chaturindriya*, and *Panchendriya*.
**O Bhagavan!** How many types of *Ekeindriya* beings are there?  **Gautama:**
*Ekeindriya* beings are of two types: *Parjatta* (sufficient) and *Aparjatta*
(insufficient).  **Similarly**, all the way to *Panchendriya*, there are two
types: *Parjatta* and *Aparjatta*.  **O Bhagavan!** What is the duration of the
*Ekeindriya* being's existence?  **Gautama:** The duration of the *Ekeindriya*
being's existence is from the *jghanya* (lowest) *antarmuhurta* (a very short
period of time) to the *utkrista* (highest) twenty-two thousand years.
**Similarly**, the duration of the *Dveindriya* being's existence is from the
*jghanya* *antarmuhurta* to the *utkrista* twelve years. The duration of the
*Treindriya* being's existence is forty-nine nights and days. The duration of
the *Chaturindriya* being's existence is six months. The duration of the
*Panchendriya* being's existence is from the *jghanya* *antarmuhurta* to the
*utkrista* thirty-three *sagaropama* (a vast period of time).  **O Bhagavan!**
What is the duration of the *Aparjatta* *Ekeindriya* being's existence?
**Gautama:** The duration of the *Aparjatta* *Ekeindriya* being's existence is
from the *jghanya* *antarmuhurta* to the *utkrista* *antarmuhurta*.
**Similarly**, the duration of all the *Aparjatta* beings should be described.
**O Bhagavan!** What is the duration of the *Parjatta* *Ekeindriya* to the
*Parjatta* *Panchendriya* beings?  **Gautama:** The duration of the *Parjatta*
*Ekeindriya* to the *Parjatta* *Panchendriya* beings is from the *jghanya*
*antarmuhurta* to the *utkrista* twenty-two thousand years minus one
*antarmuhurta*.  **Similarly**, the duration of all the *Parjatta* beings should
be described as their total duration minus one *antarmuhurta*.

## 120] [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra, Gautama! The shortest duration of existence is
an antarmuhurta, and the longest is a vanaspatikala. Similarly, the difference
between the Shreendriya, Chaturindriya, and Panchendriya, as well as the
Apariapt and Pariyaapt, should be explained in the same way. The Sutra regarding
the state of existence is clear. The clarity regarding the state of existence
and the interval between births is as follows: The state of existence of an
Ekendriya is the shortest antarmuhurta. After death, it can be reborn as a
Dwindriya, etc. The longest duration of existence is ananantakala, which is the
same as vanaspatikala. Since a vanaspati is an Ekendriya, it is also included in
the Ekendriya category. In the Dwindriya, Triindriya, and Chaturindriya Sutras,
the longest duration of existence is a Sankhyeya-thousand years, because it is
said, "Vigali Diyanam VasasahasasanKhyejja." In the Panchendriya Sutra, the
duration of existence is slightly more than a thousand sagaropama. A being can
remain in the Panchendriya form for this long in the Nairyaik, Tiryanch,
Manushya, and Deva bhava. In the Ekendriya, etc., Apariapt Sutras, the shortest
and longest duration of existence is an antarmuhurta, because the duration of
Apariaptalabdhi is only this much. In the Ekendriya-Pariyaapt Sutra, the longest
duration of existence is a Sankhyeya-thousand years. In Ekendriya, the longest
duration of existence for a Prithvikaaya is twenty-two thousand years, for an
Apkaaya is seven thousand years, for a Tejaskaaya is three aharatra, for a
Vayukaaya is three thousand years, and for a Vanaspatikaaya is ten thousand
years. Therefore, by continuously adding several Pariyaapt bhava, a Sankhyeya-
thousand years is achieved. In Dwindriya-Pariyaapt, the longest duration of
existence is a Sankhyeya year. Because the longest duration of existence for a
Dwindriya is twelve years. The longest duration of existence does not occur in
all bhava. Therefore, by continuously adding several Pariyaapt bhava, a
Sankhyeya year is achieved, not a hundred years or a thousand years. In
Triindriya-Pariyaapt Sutra, the duration of existence is a Sankhyeya aharatra,
because their longest duration of existence is forty-five days. By continuously
adding several Pariyaapt bhava, a Sankhyeya aharatra is achieved. In
Chaturindriya-Pariyaapt Sutra, the longest duration of existence is a Sankhyeya
month, because their longest duration of existence is six months. Therefore, by
continuously adding several Pariyaapt bhava, a Sankhyeya month is achieved. In
Panchendriya-Pariyaapt Sutra, the duration of existence is a Satirrek Sagaropama
Shataprithaktva. A being can remain in the Panchendriya-Pariyaapt form for this
long in the Nairyaik, Tiryanch, Manushya, and Deva bhava. The interval between
births for Ekendriya is the shortest antarmuhurta. It is expected that an
Ekendriya will be reborn as a Dwindriya, etc., after spending an antarmuhurta in
the interval between births. The longest interval is a Sankhyeya year plus two
thousand Sagaropama. The duration of existence for an Ekendriya is the same as
the duration of existence for a Sakaya. The duration of existence for a
Traskaaya is said to be a Sankhyeya year plus two thousand Sagaropama. 1.

[Fourth Pratyapatti of the Fivefold Path] [121] In the Dwīndriya, Trīndriya,
Chaturindriya and Panchendriya sūtras, the least is the Antarmūhūrta and the
most excellent is the Sarvatra Vanaspatikāla. It should be understood that which
emerges from Dwīndriya and after staying in the Vanaspati for an infinite time,
then again arises in Dwīndriya etc. Just as five औधिक sūtras are said to be
related to the internal, in the same way, they should also be said in the
context of the sufficient and insufficient.    **Alpabahutva Dwār 209.**   Thus,
O Bhagavan! In these Ekendriya, Dwīndriya, Trīndriya, Chaturindriya and
Panchendriya, who is less, who is more, who is equal, and who is superior?
Gautama! The least are the Panchendriya, the Chaturindriya are superior to them,
the Trīndriya are superior to them, the Dwīndriya are superior to them, and the
Ekendriya are infinitely superior.   Thus, in the context of the insufficient,
the Panchendriya are insufficient, the Chaturindriya are insufficient and
superior, the Trīndriya are insufficient and superior, the Dwīndriya are
insufficient and superior, the Ekendriya are insufficient and infinitely
superior, and the Saindriya are insufficient and superior.   Thus, in the
context of the sufficient, the Chaturindriya are sufficient, the Panchendriya
are sufficient and superior, the Dwīndriya are sufficient and superior, the
Trīndriya are sufficient and superior, the Ekendriya are sufficient and
infinitely superior, and the Saindriya are sufficient and superior.   Thus, O
Bhagavan! In these Saindriya, who is sufficient and insufficient, who is less,
who is more, who is equal, and who is superior?   Gautama! The Saindriya are
insufficient in all cases, and the Saindriya are sufficient and countless times
superior.   Thus, in the Ekendriya...   Thus, O Bhagavan! In these Dwīndriya,
who is sufficient and insufficient, who is less, who is more, who is equal, and
who is superior?   Gautama! The Dwīndriya are sufficient and insufficient, and
countless times superior in all cases.   Thus, in the Trīndriya, Chaturindriya,
and Panchendriya...   Thus, O Bhagavan! In these Ekendriya, Dwīndriya,
Trīndriya, Chaturindriya, and Panchendriya, who is sufficient and insufficient,
who is less, who is more, who is equal, and who is superior?   Gautama! The
Chaturindriya are sufficient in all cases, the Panchendriya are sufficient and
superior, the Dwīndriya are sufficient and superior, the Trīndriya are
sufficient and superior, the Panchendriya are insufficient and countless times
superior, the Chaturindriya are insufficient and superior, the Trīndriya are
insufficient and superior, the Dwīndriya are insufficient and superior, the
Ekendriya are insufficient and infinitely superior, the Saindriya are
insufficient and superior, the Ekendriya are sufficient and countless times
superior, the Saindriya are sufficient and superior, and the Saindriya are
superior.   This is the fivefold path, the summary of the world, the living
beings.   **209.**

Jivajivabhigama Sutra  In the same way, among the imperfect (aparyaptas) one-
sensed (ekendriyas) and others, the least are the five-sensed imperfect, more
than them are the four-sensed imperfect, more than them are the three-sensed
imperfect, more than them are the two-sensed imperfect, and more than them by
infinite times are the one-sensed imperfect. They are more than the sensed
imperfect.  Similarly, among the perfect (paryaptas) one-sensed and others, the
least are the four-sensed perfect, more than them are the five-sensed perfect,
more than them are the two-sensed perfect, more than them are the three-sensed
perfect, and more than them by infinite times are the one-sensed perfect. They
are more than the sensed perfect.  Bhagavan! Among these sensed perfect and
imperfect, which ones are less, more, equal, or superior to which ones? Gautama!
The least are the sensed imperfect, and the sensed perfect are innumerable times
more than them. Similarly, the abundance and scarcity of the one-sensed perfect
and imperfect should be known.  Bhagavan! Among these two-sensed perfect and
imperfect, which ones are less, up to superior to which ones? Gautama! The least
are the two-sensed perfect, and the two-sensed imperfect are innumerable times
more than them. Similarly, the abundance and scarcity of the three-sensed, four-
sensed, and five-sensed should be known.  Bhagavan! Among these one-sensed, two-
sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, five-sensed perfect and imperfect, which ones
are less, more, equal, or superior to which ones? Gautama! The least are the
four-sensed perfect, more than them are the five-sensed perfect, more than them

perfect, and more than them are the supreme.  This completes the description of
the five types of worldly-bound (samsarasampanna) beings.

## Fourth Stage of Liberation: Five Types of Liberated Souls  **123. The fourth
stage of liberation is characterized by five types of liberated souls.**  **1.
Abundance of One-Sensed Liberated Souls:** These are countless, exceeding the
number of finger-breadth segments. They are infinitely more numerous than the
other types of liberated souls because the number of liberated souls in the
plant kingdom is infinite.  **2. Relative Scarcity of Multi-Sensed Liberated
Souls:** The least numerous are the four-sensed liberated souls. This is because
four-sensed beings have short lifespans and do not exist for long periods.
Therefore, they are few in number at the time of liberation. Even though they
are few, they are still as numerous as the finger-breadth segments. The two-
sensed liberated souls are more numerous than the four-sensed, exceeding the
number of finger-breadth segments. The three-sensed liberated souls are even
more numerous, exceeding the number of finger-breadth segments by nature. The
one-sensed liberated souls are infinitely more numerous than the three-sensed
because the number of liberated souls in the plant kingdom is infinite.  **3.
Relative Scarcity of Liberated Souls within the Non-Liberated:** The least
numerous are the one-sensed non-liberated souls. The liberated souls are
countless times more numerous than the non-liberated. Among the one-sensed
beings, the subtle beings are numerous because they are omnipresent. Among the
subtle beings, the non-liberated are few, and the liberated are countless times
more numerous. In the two-sensed beings, the two-sensed liberated souls are the
least numerous, as they are equal to the number of finger-breadth segments. The
non-liberated are countless times more numerous, as they are equal to the number
of finger-breadth segments. Similarly, the relative scarcity of liberated and
non-liberated souls should be understood in the three-sensed, four-sensed, and
five-sensed beings.  **4. Combined Relative Scarcity of Liberated and Non-
Liberated Souls:** This should be understood based on the third and second
relative scarcity mentioned earlier. The original text clearly explains this in
detail.  **5. Conclusion:** This completes the fourth stage of liberation, which
describes the five types of liberated souls.

210. The Acharya who states that there are six types of beings who end their
cycle of rebirth, says: 1. Earth-bodied, 2. Water-bodied, 3. Fire-bodied, 4.
Air-bodied, 5. Plant-bodied, and 6.  Triple-bodied. /  Lord! What is the nature
of the Earth-bodied?  Gautama! Earth-bodied beings are of two types: Subtle-
earth-bodied and Coarse-earth-bodied. /  Subtle-earth-bodied beings are of two
types: Sufficient and Insufficient. /  Similarly, Coarse-earth-bodied beings are
also of two types: Sufficient and Insufficient.  In the same way, there are four
types each of Water-bodied, Fire-bodied, Air-bodied, and Plant-bodied. /  Lord!
What is the nature of the Triple-bodied?  Gautama! Triple-bodied beings are of
two types: Sufficient and Insufficient. /  211. Lord! How long is the lifespan
of an Earth-bodied being?  Gautama! The shortest lifespan is an Antarmukha and
the longest is twenty-two thousand years. /  Similarly, the lifespan of all
other types of beings should be stated.  The shortest lifespan of a Triple-
bodied being is an Antarmukha and the longest is thirty-three Sagaropama. /  The
lifespan of all Insufficient beings is an Antarmukha, both the shortest and the
longest. /  The lifespan of all Sufficient beings should be stated as the total
lifespan minus an Antarmukha. /  212. Lord! How long is the time period for an
Earth-bodied being to become an Earth-bodied being again?  Gautama! The shortest
time period is an Antarmukha and the longest is an immeasurable period of time,
as long as immeasurable worlds. /  Similarly, the time period for Water-bodied,
Fire-bodied, and Air-bodied beings, and Plant-bodied beings is an infinite
period of time, as long as an immeasurable portion of the Avaliya.

"O Venerable One! How long does the existence of a *Trasakaya* last? Gautama!
The minimum duration is an *Antomuhurta* and the maximum is countless *Kalpas*
equal to countless *Lokapramanas* of *Akashakhandas* devoid of dust. Similarly,
the duration of the existence of an *Apakaya*, *Tejaskaya*, and *Vayukaya*
should be known. The duration of the existence of a *Vanaspatikaya* is infinite,
equal to the number of *Kalpas* in a countless part of a *Pravalika*. The
duration of the existence of an *Asakaya* is a minimum of an *Antomuhurta* and a
maximum of countless years plus two thousand *Sagaropama*. The duration of the
existence of all six *Aparjatta* is a minimum of an *Antomuhurta* and a maximum
of an *Antomuhurta*. The maximum duration of the existence of an *Aparjatta*
*Prithvikaya* is countless thousands of years. This is also the maximum duration
of the existence of an *Aparjatta* *Apakaya*, *Vayukaya*, and *Vanaspatikaya*.
The maximum duration of the existence of a *Parjatta* *Tejaskaya* is countless
days and nights. The maximum duration of the existence of a *Parjatta*
*Trasakaya* is countless *Sagaropama* multiplied by a hundred.  O Venerable One!
What is the interval between the existence of a *Prithvikaya*? Gautama! The
minimum interval is an *Antomuhurta* and the maximum is a *Vanaspatikala*.
Similarly, the interval between the existence of an *Apakaya*, *Tejaskaya*, and
*Vayukaya* is a *Vanaspatikala*. The interval between the existence of an
*Asakaya* is also a *Vanaspatikala*. The interval between the existence of a

126) The explanation of the state of being and the difference between them, as
presented in the form of questions and answers in the Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra, is
established by the text. Only the explanation of the countless and infinite time
found in it is necessary. / The countless time is described in two ways - by
time and by space. / The countless ascending and descending periods of time are
called countless time. / The countless space-based countless time is the time
taken for the countless space-regions to become empty when one region is removed
from each of the countless space-regions at every moment. Infinite time is also
described in terms of time and space. The infinite time is the time of the
infinite ascending and descending periods. / This is from the perspective of
time-measurement. From the perspective of space-measurement, infinite time is
the time taken for the infinite-infinite space-regions to become empty when one
region is removed from each of them at every moment. This infinite time, when
described by the movement of matter, is the countless matter-movement-shaped
time. The number of these matter-movements is equal to the number of moments in
the countless parts of the pravalika. The term "vegetative time" mentioned in
the text refers to infinite time, and the term "earth-body" refers to countless
time. / 213. The least numerous are the sakayikas, then the tejaskaayikas are

## Sixfold Classification of the Fifth Understanding  **[127] The scarcity and
abundance of the Earth-bodied, etc., is also of the same type. The scarcity and
abundance of the sufficient Earth-bodied, etc., is also of the same type. O
Bhagavan! Among the sufficient and insufficient Earth-bodied, etc., who is less,
more, equal, or superior to whom?**  **Gautama:** The least numerous are the
insufficient Earth-bodied, and the sufficient Earth-bodied are countless times
more numerous. Similarly, the least numerous are the insufficient Ap-bodied, and
the sufficient Ap-bodied are countless times more numerous. In the same way, it
should be said up to the Plant-bodied. Among the As-bodied, the least numerous
are the sufficient Tris-bodied, and the insufficient Tris-bodied are countless
times more numerous.  **O Bhagavan! Among these Earth-bodied, etc., up to the
Tris-bodied, who is less, more, equal, or superior to whom in their totality?**
**Gautama:** The least numerous are the sufficient Sak-bodied, and the
insufficient Sak-bodied are countless times more numerous. The insufficient
Tejas-bodied are countless times more numerous than the insufficient Sak-bodied.
The insufficient Earth-bodied, Ap-bodied, and Air-bodied are superior to the
insufficient Tejas-bodied. The sufficient Tejas-bodied are countless times more
numerous than the insufficient Earth-bodied, Ap-bodied, and Air-bodied. The
sufficient Earth-bodied, Ap-bodied, and Air-bodied are superior to the
sufficient Tejas-bodied. The insufficient Plant-bodied are infinite times more
numerous than the sufficient Earth-bodied, Ap-bodied, and Air-bodied. The
sufficient Sak-bodied are superior to the insufficient Plant-bodied. The
sufficient Plant-bodied are countless times more numerous than the sufficient
Sak-bodied. The sufficient Sak-bodied are superior to the sufficient Plant-
bodied.  **Explanation:**  * **First Scarcity and Abundance:** This refers to
the general statement of the six bodies. The least numerous are the Tris-bodied,
because the Tris-bodied with two senses, etc., are less numerous than the other
bodies. The Tejas-bodied are countless times more numerous than the Tris-bodied,
because they are as numerous as the countless Lokakasha-regions. The Earth-
bodied are superior to the Tejas-bodied, because they are as numerous as the
countless Lokakasha-regions. The Ap-bodied are superior to the Earth-bodied,
because they are as numerous as the countless Lokakasha-regions. The Air-bodied
are superior to the Ap-bodied, because they are as numerous as the countless
Lokakasha-regions. The Plant-bodied are infinite times more numerous than the
Air-bodied, because they are as numerous as the infinite Lokakasha-regions. *
**Second Scarcity and Abundance:** This refers to the scarcity and abundance of
the insufficient bodies. It is in the same order as mentioned above. The
scarcity and abundance of the sufficient bodies should also be understood in the
same order. * **Third Scarcity and Abundance:** This refers to the scarcity and
abundance of the individual sufficient and insufficient Earth-bodied, etc. The
least numerous are the insufficient Earth-bodied, and the sufficient Earth-
bodied are countless times more numerous. There are many microscopic beings
among the Earth-bodied, because they are present throughout the entire universe.
The sufficient Earth-bodied are countless times more numerous than the
microscopic beings. Similarly, the principles for the Ap-bodied, Tejas-bodied,
Air-bodied, and Plant-bodied should be understood. Among the Tris-bodied, the
least numerous are the sufficient Tris-bodied, and the insufficient Tris-bodied
are countless times more numerous, because the sufficient Sak-bodied are as
numerous as the countable parts of a finger of the Prati-tara. * **Fourth
Scarcity and Abundance:** This refers to the combined scarcity and abundance of
the Earth-bodied, etc., in their sufficient and insufficient forms. It is as
follows: The least numerous are the sufficient Sak-bodied. The insufficient
Tris-bodied are countless times more numerous than the sufficient Sak-bodied, as
explained earlier. The insufficient Tejas-bodied are countless times more
numerous than the insufficient Tris-bodied, because they are countless...

## 128] The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra Lokakasha-Pradesha are measured in terms of
Lokakasha-Pradesha. They are superior to the Earth, Ap, and Vayu in terms of
their insufficient order, because they are in the measure of countless
Lokakasha-Pradesha-Rashi. / They are superior to the Tejas-Kayika in terms of
their sufficient number, because they are in the measure of sufficient number
from the insufficient in the subtle. / They are superior to the Earth, Ap, and
Vayu in terms of their sufficient Jiva order. They are superior to the
Vanaspati-Kayika in terms of their insufficient infinite measure, because they
are in the measure of infinite Lokakasha-Pradesha-Rashi. They are superior to
the Vanaspati-Kayika in terms of their sufficient number, because they are in
the measure of sufficient number from the insufficient in the subtle. / The
subtle Jivas are all numerous, compared to them this is a small multitude. 214.
Suhumassam, Bante! Kevaiyan Kalam Thii Pannaata? Goyama! Jahannean Antomuhutta,
Ukkoseenavi Antomuhutta / Evam Jaav Suhamaniniyassa / Evam Apjattagaanaavi
Pajattagaanaavi Jahanneanavi Ukkoseenavi Antomuhutta / / 214. Bhagavan! What is
the state of the subtle Jivas? Gautama! From the lowest, it is Antomuhurta, and
from the highest, it is also Antomuhurta / In the same way, it should be said up
to the Suhamaniniyassa / In the same way, the state of the sufficient and
insufficient subtle Jivas, from the lowest and highest, is only Antomuhurta. In
the presented Sutra, the state of the subtle and the common is explained. There
are two types of subtle Jivas - Nigod-rupa and Anigod-rupa / The state of both,
from the lowest and highest, is only Antomuhurta / The highest should be
understood as superior to the lowest Antomuhurta, otherwise, there is no meaning
in calling it the highest / In this way, six Sutras should be said regarding the
subtle Prithvi-Kaya, subtle Ap-Kaya, subtle Tejas-Kaya, subtle Vayu-Kaya, subtle
Vanaspati-Kaya, and subtle Nigod. Here, it can be doubted that the subtle
Vanaspati is the Nigod itself; its meaning is also understood from the subtle
Vanaspati, then why is the Nigod-sutra said separately? The reason is that the
subtle Vanaspati is in the form of a Jiva, and the subtle Nigod is in the form
of the basic body of infinite Jivas / Therefore, the significance of a different
Sutra is there / It has been said - "This entire Lok is filled with subtle
Nigods, like a box full of Anjan-churna, from all sides. In this Lok, which is
full of Nigods, countless Nigods are called 'Golak' because they are circular
and large in measure / The meaning of Nigod is the body of infinite Jivas /
There are countless such Golaks, and in each Golak, there are countless Nigods,
and in each Nigod, there are infinite Jivas. In one Nigod, the countless part of
the infinite Jivas comes out of it every moment, and another countless part is
born there. This Udvartana and Utpati continues every moment. Just as this order
of Udvartana and Upapat continues in one Nigod, in the same way, this Udvartana
and Upapat activity continues every moment in all the Nigods that are spread
throughout the Lok. Therefore, the state of all Nigods and Nigod Jivas is said
to be only Antomuhurta / Therefore, all Nigods change every moment due to
Udvartana and Upapat, in the time of only Antomuhurta, but they do not become
zero. Only the old

equal to the time of the disappearance of the asankheya lokakashas / In the same
way, the time of the accumulation of the subtle earth, apkay, tejas, vayu, and
vanaspati is the earth time, that is, the asankheyakal, until the subtle

Subtle, after emerging from the subtle, how long does it take to be born again

antomuhurta to the superior asankheyakal / This asankheya kal is the asankhyat
utsarpini-pravapini kal and should be understood as the asankheya kal in which
the asankheya parts of the angula from the field are taken away one by one at a
time, until they are completely empty / (The difference between the subtle
earth, apkay, tejas, vayu, and vanaspati is the vanaspati kal, that is, the
infinite time, from the perspective of being born in the vanaspati). The
difference between the subtle vanaspati and the subtle nigoda is the asankheya
kal (earth kal) / The difference between the insufficiently subtle and the
sufficiently subtle is like the aushik sutra. 1. Gola ya asankhejjaloaya,

[Translation preserving Jain terms]  [131] The duration of the Tirthankaras is
three and a half divine years, the duration of the Badaras (coarse-bodied
beings) is twenty-three thousand years, and the duration of the Vanasprsti
(plant-bodied beings) is ten thousand years. Similarly, the duration of each
type of Sharira (body) Badara is also stated.  The minimum duration of the
Nigoda (the lowest form of life) is less than an Antarmuhurta (less than 48
minutes), and the maximum duration is also Antarmuhurta. Similarly, the duration
of the Badara Nigoda is also Antarmuhurta.  The duration of all the
Aparyaptaganas (imperfect Badara beings) is Antarmuhurta, and the maximum
duration of the Paryaptaganas (perfect Badara beings) should be stated as one
Antarmuhurta less than their total duration.  218. Bhagavan! What is the
duration of the Badara (coarse-bodied beings) stated? Gautama! The minimum
duration is Antarmuhurta, and the maximum duration is thirty-three Sagaropama
(ocean-measure) years. The same duration applies to the Badara Trasakayas
(mobile beings).  The maximum duration of the Badara Prithvikaya (earth-bodied
beings) is twenty-two thousand years, the maximum duration of the Badara
Apakayikas (non-mobile beings) is seven thousand years, the maximum duration of
the Badara Tejaskayas (fire-bodied beings) is three days and nights, the maximum
duration of the Badara Vayukayas (air-bodied beings) is three thousand years,
and the maximum duration of the Badara Vanaspati (plant-bodied beings) is ten
thousand years. Similarly, the duration of each type of Sharira (body) Badara is
also stated.  The minimum and maximum duration of the Nigoda is also
Antarmuhurta. The duration of the Badara Nigoda is also the same.  The duration
of all the Aparyaptagana Badara is Antarmuhurta, and the maximum duration of the
Paryaptaga Badara should be stated as one Antarmuhurta less than their total
duration.  219. Gautama! The duration of the Badara is how long? The minimum
duration is Antarmuhurta, and the maximum duration is an innumerable number of
Utsarpini-Avasarpini (ascending-descending) cycles, an innumerable number of
Kalpas (eons), and a fraction of an Angula (finger-breadth).  The duration of
the Badara Prithvikaya, Apakaya, Tejaskayas, Vayukayas, and each type of Sharira
Badara, as well as the Badara Vanaspati, is the same as the Badara Nigoda (the
minimum is Antarmuhurta, and the maximum is an innumerable number of Kalpas,
Utsarpini-Avasarpini cycles, and a fraction of an Angula).  The minimum duration
of the Badara Nigoda is Antarmuhurta, and the maximum duration is an extremely
long period, an innumerable number of Utsarpini-Avasarpini cycles, and a
fraction of an Angula.  The minimum duration of these (Badara beings) is
Antarmuhurta, and the maximum duration is seventeen Sagaropama crores.
Similarly, the number of Samaya (smallest unit of time) in an Angula is also
innumerable.  The remaining details about the Badara, such as the connection
with trees and other aspects, are stated elsewhere.

long does a Bādar Jīva remain as a Bādar?** **Gautama:** From the lowest
Antarmūhūrta to the highest, it is an Asankhyeya-kāla. This Asankhyeya-kāla is
equal to Asankhyeya Utsarpini-Avasarpini periods (Kāla-mārgaṇā) and is also
equal to the time taken to exhaust Asankhyeya Ākāśa-pradeśas of the size of an
Angula-bhāga (Kṣetra-mārgaṇā) by removing one at a time.   **Bādar Pṛthvīkāyika,
Bādar Apkāyika, Bādar Tejas-kāyika, Bādar Vāyu-kāyika, each Bādar Vanaspati-
kāyika and Bādar Nigoda have a lowest Kāya-sthiti of Antarmūhūrta and a highest
of seventy Kodakodi Sagaropama.**   **The lowest Kāya-sthiti of Bādar Vanaspati
is Antarmūhūrta and the highest is Asankhyeya-kāla, which is equal to Asankhyeya
Utsarpini-Avasarpini periods (Kāla-mārgaṇā) and is also equal to the time taken
to exhaust Asankhyeya Ākāśa-pradeśas of the size of an Angula-bhāga (Kṣetra-
mārgaṇā) by removing one at a time.**  **The lowest Kāya-sthiti of a normal
Nigoda is Antarmūhūrta and the highest is Ananta-kāla.** **This Ananta-kāla is
equal to Ananta Utsarpini-Avasarpini periods (Kāla-mārgaṇā) and is also equal to
two and a half Pudgala-parāvṛtta (Kṣetra-mārgaṇā).**  **In the Bādar Sakāya-
sutra, the lowest Kāya-sthiti is Antarmūhūrta and the highest is Sankhyeya years
plus two thousand Sagaropama.**  **In the ten Sutras of Bādar Aparyāpta, the
lowest and highest Kāya-sthiti should be considered as Antarmūhūrta.**  **In the
Bādar Paryāpta Prodhīka-sutra, the lowest Kāya-sthiti is Antarmūhūrta and the

the Apkāya-sutras.**  **In the Tejas-kāya-sutra, the lowest Kāya-sthiti is
Antarmūhūrta and the highest is Sankhyāta Ahorātra.**  **The Sutras of Vāyu-

[133 from the value of the sixth type of asaya, the fifth type of pratipatti,
one should know the time measure in which they become immersed. (The state of
the subtle body is the same as the difference of the badar.) The remaining
badar, the earth-bodied, the badar apkayik, the badar tejaskaik, the badar
vayukaik, each badar vanaspatikaik and the badar traskaik - the difference of
these six should be known as the vanaspatikal. - Similarly, ten-ten sutras
related to insufficient and sufficient should also be said in the same way as
above. This is what is said in the gatha - the difference between prodik, badar
vanaspati, general nigod and badar nigod is the sankhyeyakal and the difference
of the rest is the vanaspatikala-praman. Alpabahutvadwar 221. (a) (1)

## 134] [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra (2) The relative scarcity of insufficient badars
should be known according to the Prauhik Sutra - for example, the fewest badars
are Traskayik insufficient, then the badars are Tejas kayik insufficient in
countless numbers, and so on in ascending order. (3) The relative scarcity of
sufficient badars - the fewest badars are Tejas kayik sufficient, then the
badars are Traskayik sufficient in countless numbers, then the badars are each
body Vanaspatikayik sufficient in countless numbers, then the badars are Nigod
sufficient in countless numbers, then the badars are Prithvi kayik sufficient in

then the badars are Vayukay sufficient in countless numbers, then the badars are
Vanaspatikayik sufficient in infinite numbers, then the badars are sufficient in
special abundance. (4) The relative scarcity of sufficient and insufficient
badars for each (everywhere) there are few sufficient badars and countless
insufficient badars, because countless insufficient badars are born in the
shelter of one sufficient badar. (The statement of all the sutras is like the
Sakayik badars /) (5) The combined relative scarcity, Bhagavan! Among the
badars, which badars are less abundant than the Prithvi kayik badars, up to the
Sakayik badars, and which are more abundant, and by how much? Gautama! The
fewest badars are Tejas kayik sufficient, then the badars are Traskayik
sufficient in countless numbers, then the badars are Askayik insufficient in
countless numbers, then each body badars are Vanaspatikayik sufficient in
countless numbers, then the badars are Nigod sufficient in countless numbers,
then the Prithvi-Ap-Vayukay sufficient in countless numbers respectively, then
the badars are Tejas kayik insufficient in countless numbers, then each body
badars are Vanaspati insufficient in countless numbers, then the badars are
Nigod insufficient in countless numbers, then the badars are Prithvi-Ap-Vayukay
insufficient in countless numbers, then the badars are Vanaspati sufficient in
infinite numbers, then the badars are sufficient in special abundance, then the
badars are Vanaspati insufficient in countless numbers, then the badars are
insufficient in special abundance, then the badars are sufficient in special
abundance. Discussion - First, the relative scarcity of the six bodies has been
explained. It is as follows - the fewest badars are Traskayik, because only the
two-sense beings etc. are Tras badars, and they are less abundant than the other
bodies / Then the badars are Tejas kayik in countless numbers, because they are
countless Lokakashapradeshpraman. Then each body badars are Vanaspatikayik in
countless numbers, because their locations are countless / ' Badar 1. And it is
said in the second place called Prajnapanaya - in the Antomanussakhete, in the
two and a half days, in the oceans, in the Nivaghas, in the twenty-two Rasas, in
the Karmabhumis, in the Vaghas, in the five Mahavidehas, there the locations of
the Bajrateukayikas are established, and wherever the locations of the
Bajrateukayikas are established, there the locations of the Apbajjattas are
established.

[Translation preserving Jain terms]  [135] The tejas (fiery) substance is only
in the manushya-kshetra (human realm), while the bādar (gross) vanaspati-kāya
(plant-bodied beings) are in all the three lokas (worlds). Therefore, the
asankhyeya-guna (innumerable qualities) of the kshetra (realm) make the bādar
tejaskāyikas (fiery-bodied beings) have innumerable bādar vanaspati-kāyika
(gross plant-bodied) in each body. From them, the bādar nigoda (extremely subtle
beings) have asankhyeya-guna, because due to extremely subtle pervasion and
mostly being ubiquitous in water, panak, sevāla, etc. are inevitably present in
water, thus the asankhyeya-guna are manifested. From the bādar nigoda, the bādar
prithvī-kāyika (earth-bodied beings) have asankhyeya-guna, because they are
present in the eight earths, all the vimānas (celestial abodes), all the
bhavanas (buildings) and mountains, etc. From them, the bādar apakāyika (water-
bodied beings) have asankhyeya-guna, because there is abundance of water in the
oceans. From them, the bādar vāyu-kāyika (air-bodied beings) have asankhyeya-
guna, because air is also possible in the polar regions. From them, the bādar
vanaspati-kāyika have ananta-guna (infinite qualities), because there are
infinite jīvas (living beings) in each bādar nigoda. From them, the sāmānya
(general) bādar are vishesha-adhika (superior), because the bādar trasaka-yika
(mobile-bodied beings) etc. are also included in them.  (2) The second alpa-
bahutva (rarity-abundance) is regarding the aparyāptas (non-developed) of these
shatkāyas (six bodily realms). The least are the bādar trasaka-yika aparyāptas
(the reason for which was explained earlier), from them the bādar tejas-kāyika
aparyāptas have asankhyeya-guna, because they are of the measure of innumerable
lokākāshas (spatial units). In this way, the alpa-bahutva should be understood
from the previously stated.  (3) The third alpa-bahutva is related to the
paryāptas (developed) of the shatkāyas. The least are the bādar tejas-kāyika,
because they are equal to the time of the square of the pāvalika (a unit of
time) minus a little time. From them, the bādar asaka-yika paryāptas have
asankhyeya-guna, because they are equal to the countable parts of an angula
(finger-breadth) in the pratar (a unit of measurement). From them, the prati-
sarīrī (in each body) vanaspati-kāyika paryāptas have asankhyeya-guna, because
they are equal to the innumerable parts of an angula in the pratar. From them,
the bādar nigoda paryāptakas have asankhyeya-guna, because they have extremely
subtle pervasion and are ubiquitous in water bodies. From them, the bādar
prithvī-kāyika paryāptas have asankhyeya-guna, because they are of the measure
of the innumerable parts of an angula in the pratar. From them, the bādar ap-
kāyika paryāptas have asankhyeya-guna, because they are of the measure of the
innumerable parts of an angula in the pratar. From them, the bādar vāyu-kāyika
paryāptas have asankhyeya-guna, because they are equal to the spatial regions of
the countable parts of the innumerable prataras in the dhani-krita
(concentrated) loka. From them, the bādar vanaspati paryāptas have ananta-guna,
because there are infinite jīvas in each bādar nigoda. From them, the sāmānya
(general) bādar paryāptakas are vishesha-adhika, because all the paryāptas like
bādar tejas-kāyika, etc. are included in them.  (4) The fourth alpa-bahutva is
said regarding the paryāptas and aparyāptas of each of them. Everywhere, the
asankhyeya-guna of the aparyāptas should be said to be from the paryāptas. From
the bādar prithvī-kāya to the bādar trasa-kāya, everywhere:  Goyamā! The sthānas
(abodes) of the paryāpta (developed) bādar vanaspati-kāyikas are declared to be
in the seven oceans, the seven ocean-encircled regions, the underworld, the
bhavana-prathadas (surfaces of buildings), the upper lokas, the vimāna-āvalīs
(rows of celestial abodes), the vimāna-prathadas (surfaces of celestial abodes),
the agada (uneven) regions of the transverse loka, the lakes, rivers, lakes,
ponds, pools, springs, marshes, swamps, pits, islands, oceans, and all the
water-bodies and water-places. And wherever the sthānas of the paryāpta bādar
vanaspati-kāyikas are declared, there the sthānas of the aparyāpta bādar
vanaspati-kāyikas are also declared. - Pragyāpanā Sthānapada

[136] The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra has countless more insufficient than
sufficient, because countless insufficient Badar are born in the shadow of one
sufficient Badar. (5) The fifth Alpabahutva is a combined statement of the
sufficient and insufficient of the six Kayas. / It is as follows: the fewest
Badar Tejaskaayik sufficient, countless times more Badar Traskaayik sufficient
than them, countless times more Badar Vanaspatikaayik sufficient than them,
countless times more Badar Nigod sufficient than them, countless times more
Badar Prithvikaayik sufficient than them, countless times more Badar Apkaayik
sufficient than them, countless times more Badar Vayukaayik sufficient than
them. / (The logic of the above terms should be known as before.) _ There are
countless times more Badar Tejaskaayik insufficient than them, because Badar
Vayukaayik sufficient are equal to the regions of light in countless
Lokakashapradesha, but Badar Tejaskaayik insufficient are equal to countless
Lokakashapradesha. Because there are countless distinctions of the countless,
one should know that this countless is countless times more than the previous
countless. From Badar Tejaskaayik insufficient, each Badar Vanaspatikaayik,
Badar Nigod, Badar Prithvikaayik, Badar Apkaayik, Badar Vayukaayik insufficient
should be said to be countless times more. / There are infinitely more Badar
Vanaspatikaayik sufficient than Badar Vayukaayik insufficient, because there are
infinite Jivas in each Badar Nigod. They are more special than the general Badar
sufficient, because the Badar Tejaskaayik etc. sufficient are projected into
them. / There are countless times more Badar Vanaspatikaayik insufficient than
them, because countless insufficient Badar Vanaspatikaayik Nigod are born in the
shadow of each sufficient Badar Vanaspatikaayik Nigod. They are more special
than the general Badar insufficient, because the Badar Tejaskaayik etc.
insufficient are projected into them. They are more special than the general
Badar without the sufficient-insufficient distinction, because all Badar
sufficient-insufficient are included in them. Thus, five Alpabahutva have been
said with regard to Badar. / The combined Alpabahutva of the subtle Badar is 221

[135] The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra has infinite qualities in the gross, then there
are many more in the subtle, then there are innumerable qualities in the subtle
plant-like bodies, then there are many more in the (general) subtle. (2) The
second alpabahutva is about the insufficient of these. It is as follows: the
least are the gross Traskaayik insufficient, then there are innumerable
qualities of the gross Tejaskaayik insufficient, then there are innumerable
qualities of the gross Vanaspatikaayik insufficient, then there are innumerable
qualities of the gross Nigod insufficient, then there are innumerable qualities
of the gross Prithvikaayik insufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of
the gross Apkaayik insufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the
gross Vaayukaayik insufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the
subtle Tejaskaayik insufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the
subtle Prithvikaayik insufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the
subtle Apkaayik insufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the subtle
Vaayukaayik insufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the subtle
Nigod insufficient, then there are infinite qualities of the gross
Vanaspatikaayik insufficient, then there are many more of the general gross
insufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the subtle Vanaspatikaayik
insufficient, then there are many more of the general subtle insufficient. (3)
The third alpabahutva is about the sufficient of these. It is as follows: the
least are the gross Tejaskaayik sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities
of the gross Traskaayik sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the
gross Vanaspatikaayik sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the
gross Nigod sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the gross
Prithvikaayik sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the gross
Apkaayik sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the gross
Vaayukaayik sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the subtle
Tejaskaayik sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the subtle
Prithvikaayik sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the subtle
Apkaayik sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the subtle
Vaayukaayik sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the subtle Nigod
sufficient, then there are infinite qualities of the gross Vanaspatikaayik
sufficient, then there are many more of the general gross sufficient, then there
are innumerable qualities of the subtle Vanaspatikaayik sufficient, then there
are many more of the general subtle sufficient. (4) The fourth alpabahutva is
about the relationship between the sufficient and insufficient of each of these.
It is as follows: the least are the gross sufficient, because they are finite
and limited in area. Then there are innumerable qualities of the gross
insufficient, because innumerable gross insufficient are produced in the
destruction of each gross sufficient. Then there are innumerable qualities of
the subtle insufficient, because their area is innumerable due to their
pervasiveness in all the worlds. Then there are innumerable qualities of the
subtle sufficient, because they are eternal and always acquire innumerable
qualities. There are seven sutras in total here: 1. General to subtle - gross
sufficient-insufficient, 2. Subtle - gross Prithvikaayik sufficient-
insufficient, 3. Subtle - gross Apkaayik sufficient-insufficient, 4. Subtle -
gross Tejaskaayik sufficient-insufficient, 5. Subtle - gross Vaayukaayik
sufficient-insufficient, 6. Subtle - gross Vanaspatikaayik sufficient-
insufficient, and 7. Subtle - gross Nigod sufficient-insufficient.

Nigoda is a technical term in Jain philosophy, which means the base or support
of infinite beings. Generally, Nigoda is a subtle and ordinary plant form,
however, it has a separate identity. Therefore, it has been said to be of two
types - Nigoda and Nigodajiva / Nigoda is the basic body of infinite beings and
Nigodajiva is the infinite beings with different Tejas-Karman bodies residing in
one Audarik body. 'Pagam' says - This whole world is filled with Sukshma Nigodas
like a container filled with collyrium powder. This world filled with Nigodas is
called "Golak" because of the innumerable Nigodas being circular and large in
size / There are innumerable such spheres and in each sphere there are
innumerable Nigodas and in each Nigoda there are infinite beings. Both Nigoda
and Nigodajiva are of two types - Sukshma Nigoda and Badar Nigoda / Sukshma
Nigoda are present in the whole world and Badar Nigoda are in the form of roots,
tubers etc. Both these Sukshma and Badar Nigodajiva are of two types - Paryaptak
and Aparyaptak / 223. Nigoda, Bhagavan! Are they countable, uncountable or
infinite in terms of matter? Gautama! They are countable, uncountable, not

[Sixfold Classification of the Fifth Understanding] [11 And the Nigoda-jiva, in
nine ways, are to be considered in terms of their pervasiveness, all are
infinite / 223. Bhagavan! Are Nigoda dravyas countable, uncountable, or infinite
in number? Gautama! They are not countable, they are uncountable, they are not
infinite. Similarly, their sufficient and insufficient sutras should also be
stated. Bhagavan! Are subtle Nigoda dravyas countable, uncountable, or infinite
in number? Gautama! They are not countable, they are uncountable, they are not
infinite. Similarly, the sutras concerning sufficient and insufficient should
also be stated. Similarly, the same should be said about the Badar Nigoda. Their
sufficient and insufficient sutras should also be stated in the same way /
Bhagavan! Are Nigoda-jiva dravyas countable, uncountable, or infinite in number?
Gautama! They are not countable, they are not uncountable, they are infinite.
Similarly, their sufficient sutras should also be known / Similarly, the subtle
Nigoda-jiva, their sufficient and insufficient sutras, and the Badar, their
sufficient and insufficient sutras should also be stated. (These are eighteen
sutras in total, nine for Nigoda and nine for Nigoda-jiva, in terms of dravyas.)
Bhagavan! Are Nigoda countable, uncountable, or infinite in number in terms of
their expanse? Gautama! They are not countable, they are not uncountable, but
they are infinite. Similarly, the sufficient and insufficient sutras should also
be stated. Similarly, the subtle Nigoda and their sufficient and insufficient
sutras should be stated / All these are infinite in terms of their expanse.
Similarly, the Badar Nigoda and their sufficient and insufficient sutras should
be stated. All these are infinite in terms of their expanse. Similarly, in terms
of the expanse of the Nigoda-jiva, nine sutras should be stated as infinite.
Discussion: The present sutra deals with the inquiry and answer regarding the
number of Nigoda and Nigoda-jiva. The inquiry is made whether the Nigoda are
countable, uncountable, or infinite? The answers to these questions are from two
perspectives: in terms of dravyas and in terms of expanse / In terms of dravyas,
the Nigoda are not countable, because the Nigoda that permeate all the lokas are
immeasurable in terms of angula-samkhyeya-bhag. They are uncountable, because
they are as vast as the expanse of countless lokas and akasha. They are not
infinite, because only the knowers have not known them to be infinite / The
three sutras related to the general Nigoda, the insufficient general Nigoda, and
the sufficient general Nigoda should be known in the same way / Similarly, three
sutras for the subtle Nigoda and three sutras for the Badar Nigoda - a total of
nine sutras have been stated. The Nigoda-jiva are not countable, not
uncountable, but infinite in terms of dravyas / Since there are infinite jivas
in each Nigoda, the Nigoda-jiva are infinite in terms of dravyas. Similarly, in
their insufficient and sufficient sutras, they should also be stated as
infinite.

225. Those who say that there are seven types of beings who are involved in the
cycle of birth and death (samsara), they say that these seven types are:
Nairyika, Tiryanch, Tiryanch (Tiryanch), Manushya, Manushi, Deva and Devi. The
Nairyika have a minimum lifespan of ten thousand years and a maximum lifespan of
thirty-three Sagaropama. The Tiryanch have a minimum lifespan of Antomuhurta and
a maximum lifespan of three Palyopama. The Tiryanch, Manushya and Manushi also
have the same lifespan. The Devas have a lifespan similar to the Nairyika, and
the Devis have a minimum lifespan of ten thousand years and a maximum lifespan
of fifty-five Palyopama. The Nairyika, Devas and Devis have the same lifespan as
their Kayasthiti (physical form). The Tiryanch have a minimum lifespan of
Antomuhurta and a maximum lifespan of infinite time. The Tiryanch have a minimum
lifespan of Antomuhurta and a maximum lifespan of three Palyopama, which is
greater than the previous Kotipruthaktva. Similarly, the Manushya and Manushi
also have the same Kayasthiti. The Nairyika have a minimum lifespan of
Antomuhurta and a maximum lifespan of Vanasakal. Similarly, all the Tiryanch
have a minimum lifespan of Antomuhurta and a maximum lifespan of Sagaropama,
which is greater than the previous Kotipruthaktva. The Manushi have a minimum
lifespan of Appabahu, the Manushya have a minimum lifespan of Asankhyeya Guna,
the Nairyika have a minimum lifespan of Asankhyeya Guna, the Tiryanch have a
minimum lifespan of Asankhyeya Guna, the Devas have a minimum lifespan of
Asankhyeya Guna, the Devis have a minimum lifespan of Sankhyeya Guna, and the
Tiryanch have a minimum lifespan of Anant Guna. These are the seven types of
beings who are involved in the cycle of birth and death (samsara).

##  Translation:  [146] The difference between **Nairyikas** is a minimum of an
**antarmuhurt** and a maximum of **vanaspatikala** (infinite time).  Except for
**tiryakyonikas**, the difference for all others should be considered the same.
The difference between **tiryakyonikas** is a minimum of an **antarmuhurt** and
a maximum of **sadhik sagaropama shataprithaktva**.  The relative abundance is
as follows: the fewest are **human females**, then **humans** are countless
times more, then **Nairyikas** are countless times more, then **tiryak striyas**
are countless times more, then **Devas** are countless times more, then
**Devis** are countable times more, and finally **tiryakyonikas** are infinite
times more.  This sevenfold **samsara**-ending **pratipatti** is complete.
**Discussion:** According to the sevenfold **pratipatti**, there are seven types
of **samsara**-ending beings: **Nairyikas**, **tiryakyonikas**, **tiryak
striyas**, **humans**, **human females**, **Devas**, and **Devis**.  The
**position**, **sanchittana**, **difference**, and **relative abundance** of
these seven are explained in this **sutra**.  **Position:** The position of
**Nairyikas** is a minimum of ten thousand years and a maximum of thirty-three
**sagaropama**. The minimum position of **tiryakyonikas**, **tiryakyonika
striyas**, **humans**, and **human females** is an **antarmuhurt** and a maximum
of three **palyopama**. The position of **Devas** is a minimum of ten thousand
years and a maximum of thirty-three **sagaropama**. The position of **Devis** is
a minimum of ten thousand years and a maximum of fifty-five **palyopama**. This
position is relative to the **Isan Devis** who are not subject to **parigriha**.
**Sanchittana:** The **sanchittana** (body state) of **Nairyikas**, **Devas**,
and **Devis** should be understood as the same as their **bhavasthiti** (state
of being). This is because **Nairyikas** and **Devas** do not become
**Nairyikas** or **Devas** in the next life after death. The **sanchittana** of
**tiryakyonikas** is a minimum of an **antarmuhurt** (it is possible to be born
elsewhere after this time) and a maximum of **anantakala** (infinite time). This
**anantakala** is infinite in terms of **utsarpini-avsarpin** (ascending-
descending time) and in terms of **kshetramargana** (spatial movement), it
should be understood as the time it takes to empty countless **lokaakasha**
regions by removing them one by one at a time. This **anantakala** is also
countless in terms of **pudgalparavarta** (transformation of matter). The
**sanchittana** (body state) of **tiryak striyas** is a minimum of an
**antarmuhurt** and a maximum of **purvakotiprithaktva** plus three
**palyopama**. This is relative to the seven **bhavas** (existences) with a
lifespan of **purvakoti** and the eighth **bhavas** where they are born as
**Devakuru** etc. The body state of **humans** and **human females** should be
understood in the same way.  **Difference:** The difference between
**Nairyikas** is a minimum of an **antarmuhurt**. This should be understood as
the difference between being born in **naraka** (hell) and being born in a
**tiryak** or **human** womb after being released from **naraka** and dying with
an **ashubha adhyavasaya** (unfavorable determination). The maximum difference
is **anantakala**. This **anantakala** should be understood as
**vanaspatikala**. This is the difference between being released from **naraka**

## The Seventh Understanding of the Eightfold Path (226)  Those who say that the
beings who have attained the end of the cycle of existence are of eight types,
according to them, these are the eight types: 1. **Prathama-samaya-nairyaika**,
2. **A-prathamasamaya-nairyaika**, 3. **Prathama-samaya-tiryag-yoni**, 4.
**A-prathamasamaya-tiryag-yoni**, 5. **Prathama-samaya-manushya**, 6.
**A-prathamasamaya-manushya**, 7. **Prathama-samaya-deva**, and 8.
**A-prathamasamaya-deva**.  **Question:**  O Bhagavan! How long is the
**Prathama-samaya-nairyaika**'s existence?  **Answer:**  O Gautama! From the
lowest, it is one **samaya**, and from the highest, it is also one **samaya**.
**Question:**  How long is the **A-prathamasamaya-nairyaika**'s existence?
**Answer:**  From the lowest, it is one **samaya** less than ten thousand years,
and from the highest, it is one **samaya** less than thirty-three
**sagaropama**.  **Question:**  How long is the **Prathama-samaya-tiryag-
yoni**'s existence?  **Answer:**  From the lowest, it is one **samaya**, and
from the highest, it is also one **samaya**.  **Question:**  How long is the
**A-prathamasamaya-tiryag-yoni**'s existence?  **Answer:**  From the lowest, it
is one **samaya** less than the duration of the **bhavagrahana**, and from the
highest, it is one **samaya** less than three **paligro-vamai**.  The same
applies to humans as it does to the **tiryag-yoni**, and to the **devas** as it
does to the others.  **Question:**  O Bhagavan! How long is the **Prathama-
samaya-tiryag-yoni**'s existence?  **Answer:**  From the lowest, it is one
**samaya**, and from the highest, it is also one **samaya**.  **Question:**  How
long is the **A-prathamasamaya-tiryag-yoni**'s existence?  **Answer:**  From the

## The Seventh Attainment of the Eightfold Path  **[149] The state of a
*Prathmasamaya* *Tiryagyoni* is the most inferior for one *samaya* and the most
superior also for one *samaya*. The state of an *Apathmasamaya* *Tiryagyoni* is
the most inferior for one *samaya* less than a *Kshullakabhavagrahan* and the
most superior for one *samaya* less than three *Palyaopamas*.**  **In the same
way, the state of humans should be said to be similar to that of *Tiryagyonis*
and the state of gods should be said to be similar to that of *Nairyikas*.**
**The state of *Nairyikas* and gods is the same for both types ( *Prathmasamaya*
and *Apathmasamaya*) of *Nairyikas* and gods, which is the state of the body (
*Sanchittana*).**  **O Bhagavan! For how long can a *Prathmasamaya* *Tiryagyoni*
remain in that form?**  **Gautama! It can remain for one *samaya* in the most
inferior state and also for one *samaya* in the most superior state. An
*Apathmasamaya* *Tiryagyoni* can remain for one *samaya* less than a
*Kshullakabhav* in the most inferior state and for the duration of a
*Vanaspatikala* in the most superior state.**  **A *Prathmasamaya* human can
remain for one *samaya* in the most inferior state and for one *samaya* in the
most superior state. An *Apathmasamaya* human can remain for one *samaya* less
than a *Kshullakabhavagrahan* in the most inferior state and for one *samaya*
less than three *Palyaopamas* plus the *Purvakotiprithaktva* in the most
superior state.**  **227. Difference:**  **- For a *Prathmasamaya* *Nairyika*,
the most inferior state is for ten thousand *Vasa* less than a *Muhurta* and the
most superior state is for the duration of a *Vanaspatikala*.**  **- For an
*Apathmasamaya* *Nairyika*, the most inferior state is for one *Muhurta* and the
most superior state is for the duration of a *Vanaspatikala*.**  **- For a
*Prathmasamaya* *Tiryagyoni*, the most inferior state is for two
*Kshullakabhavagrahan* less than one *Samaya* and the most superior state is for
the duration of a *Vanaspatikala*.**  **- For an *Apathmasamaya* *Tiryagyoni*,
the most inferior state is for one *Kshullakabhavagrahan* plus one *Samaya* and
the most superior state is for the duration of a *Sagaro Bama* plus one
*Samaya*.**  **- For a *Prathmasamaya* human, the most inferior state is for two
*Kshullakabhavagrahan* less than one *Samaya* and the most superior state is for
the duration of a *Vanaspatikala*.**  **- For an *Apathmasamaya* human, the most
inferior state is for one *Kshullakabhavagrahan* plus one *Samaya* and the most
superior state is for the duration of a *Vanaspatikala*.**  **- For gods, just
like *Nairyikas*, the most inferior state is for ten thousand *Vasa* less than a
*Muhurta* and the most superior state is for the duration of a
*Vanaspatikala*.**  **- For *Apathmasamaya* gods, the most inferior state is for
one *Muhurta* and the most superior state is for the duration of a
*Vanaspatikala*.**  **Few or Many:**  **O Bhagavan! Among these, from
*Prathmasamaya* *Nairyikas* to *Prathmasamaya* gods, who are few and who are
many?**  **Gautama! In all cases, *Prathmasamaya* humans are countless,
*Prathmasamaya* *Nairyikas* are countless, *Prathmasamaya* gods are countless,
*Prathmasamaya* *Tiryagyonis* are countless, *Apathmasamaya* *Nairyikas* to
*Apathmasamaya* gods are also the same, few or many, but *Apathmasamaya*
*Tiryagyonis* are infinite.**  **Among these, from *Prathmasamaya* *Nairyikas*
to *Apathmasamaya* *Nairyikas*, who are few and who are many?**  **In all cases,
*Prathmasamaya* *Nairyikas* are countless, *Apathmasamaya* *Nairyikas* are
countless. It is the same for all.**  **1. 256 *Pavalikas* constitute a

[Jīvājīvābhigamasūtra] The jighanya (minimum) interval of the first-moment-
nārakayas is more than ten thousand years, and the uttama (maximum) interval is
the vegetative period. The jighanya interval of the non-first-moment-nārakayas
is the antaramuhūrta (less than 48 minutes) and the uttama is the vegetative
period. The jighanya interval of the first-moment-tiryañc-yonis is one samaya
(smallest unit of time) less than two kṣullakabhavagrahana, and the uttama is
the vegetative period. The jighanya interval of the non-first-moment-tiryañc-
yonis is one samaya more than one kṣullakabhavagrahana, and the uttama is
slightly more than one sāgaropamāśatapṛthaktva. The jighanya interval of the
first-moment-manuṣyas is one samaya less than two kṣullakabhava, and the uttama
is the vegetative period. The jighanya interval of the non-first-moment-manuṣyas
is one samaya more than one kṣullakabhava, and the uttama is the vegetative
period. Similarly, for the devas, the intervals should be stated as in the case
of the nārakayas. For example, the jighanya interval of the first-moment-devas
is more than ten thousand years, and the uttama is the vegetative period. The
jighanya interval of the non-first-moment-devas is the antaramuhūrta and the
uttama is the vegetative period.  Regarding the alpabahutvadvāra (comparison of
the few and the many), among the first-moment-nārakayas up to the first-moment-
devas, who is less, more, equal, or specially more than whom? Gautama! The
first-moment-manuṣyas are the least, the first-moment-nārakayas are
asaṃkhyeyaguṇa (innumerable times) more than them, the first-moment-devas are
asaṃkhyeyaguṇa more than the first-moment-nārakayas, and the first-moment-
tiryañc-yonis are asaṃkhyeyaguṇa more than the first-moment-devas. The
alpabahutvadvāra of the non-first-moment-nārakayas up to the non-first-moment-
devas is in the same order, but the non-first-moment-tiryañc-yonis should be
said to be anantaguṇa (infinitely more). Bhagavan! Among the first-moment-
nārakayas and the non-first-moment-nārakayas, who is less, more, equal, or
specially more than whom? Gautama! The first-moment-nārakayas are the least, and
the non-first-moment-nārakayas are asaṃkhyeyaguṇa more than them. Similarly, the
alpabahutvadvāra of the first-moment and non-first-moment tiryañc-yonis,
manuṣyas, and devas should be stated. Bhagavan! Among the first-moment-nārakayas
up to the non-first-moment-devas, who is less, more, equal, or specially more
than whom? Gautama! The first-moment-manuṣyas are the least, the non-first-
moment-manuṣyas are asaṃkhyeyaguṇa more than them, the first-moment-nārakayas
are asaṃkhyeyaguṇa more than the non-first-moment-manuṣyas, the first-moment-
devas are asaṃkhyeyaguṇa more than the first-moment-nārakayas, and the first-
moment-tiryañc-yonis are asaṃkhyeyaguṇa more than the first-moment-devas.

## The Eighthfold Path: The Seventh Understanding [151 Qualities]  This section
describes the eight types of beings who have attained liberation from the cycle
of birth and death.   **The Seventh Understanding: The Eightfold Path**  This
seventh understanding discusses the eight types of beings who have attained
liberation from the cycle of birth and death. These eight types are categorized
as: Naraka (hell beings), Tiryanch (animals), Manushya (humans), and Deva
(gods). Each of these four categories is further divided into two subcategories:
Prathmasamaya (those who are in their first lifetime) and Aprathmasamaya (those
who are not in their first lifetime). This categorization encompasses all beings
who have attained liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
**Prathmasamaya** beings are those who are in their first lifetime.
**Aprathmasamaya** beings are those who are not in their first lifetime.  **The
Eightfold Path**  The eight types of beings who have attained liberation from
the cycle of birth and death are categorized based on their **position**,
**duration of existence**, **interval between births**, and **frequency of
birth**.  **Position**  * **Prathmasamaya Narayik:** The position of a
Prathmasamaya Narayik is limited to a single lifetime, as they do not exist in
subsequent lifetimes. * **Aprathmasamaya Narayik:** The position of an
Aprathmasamaya Narayik ranges from a minimum of 10,000 years less than a single
lifetime to a maximum of 33 Sagaropama (a unit of time) less than a single
lifetime. * **Prathmasamaya Tiryanch:** The position of a Prathmasamaya Tiryanch
is limited to a single lifetime. * **Aprathmasamaya Tiryanch:** The position of
an Aprathmasamaya Tiryanch ranges from a minimum of a Ksullakbhava (a unit of
time) less than a single lifetime to a maximum of three Palyopama (a unit of
time) less than a single lifetime. * **Prathmasamaya Manushya:** The position of
a Prathmasamaya Manushya is similar to that of a Tiryanch. * **Aprathmasamaya
Manushya:** The position of an Aprathmasamaya Manushya is similar to that of a
Narayik. * **Prathmasamaya Deva:** The position of a Prathmasamaya Deva is
similar to that of a Narayik. * **Aprathmasamaya Deva:** The position of an
Aprathmasamaya Deva is similar to that of a Narayik.  **Duration of Existence
(Sंचिट्ठणा)**  * **Deva and Narayik:** The duration of existence of Deva and
Narayik is the same as their position, as they do not reincarnate as Deva or
Narayik after death. * **Prathmasamaya Tiryanch:** The duration of existence of
a Prathmasamaya Tiryanch is limited to a single lifetime. * **Aprathmasamaya
Tiryanch:** The duration of existence of an Aprathmasamaya Tiryanch ranges from
a minimum of a Ksullakbhava (a unit of time) less than a single lifetime to a
maximum of an infinite duration (Vanaspatikala). * **Prathmasamaya Manushya:**
The duration of existence of a Prathmasamaya Manushya is limited to a single
lifetime. * **Aprathmasamaya Manushya:** The duration of existence of an
Aprathmasamaya Manushya ranges from a minimum of a Ksullakbhava (a unit of time)
less than a single lifetime to a maximum of three Palyopama (a unit of time)
less than a single lifetime, minus the duration of the previous seven lifetimes.
* **Prathmasamaya Deva:** The duration of existence of a Prathmasamaya Deva is
similar to that of a Narayik. * **Aprathmasamaya Deva:** The duration of
existence of an Aprathmasamaya Deva is similar to that of a Narayik.  **Interval
Between Births (अंतर)**  * **Prathmasamaya Narayik:** The interval between
births of a Prathmasamaya Narayik ranges from a minimum of 10,000 years plus an
Antarmuhurta (a unit of time) to a maximum of an infinite duration. *
**Aprathmasamaya Narayik:** The interval between births of an Aprathmasamaya
Narayik is a minimum of an Antarmuhurta (a unit of time). * **Prathmasamaya
Tiryanch:** The interval between births of a Prathmasamaya Tiryanch is similar
to that of a Narayik. * **Aprathmasamaya Tiryanch:** The interval between births
of an Aprathmasamaya Tiryanch is similar to that of a Narayik. * **Prathmasamaya
Manushya:** The interval between births of a Prathmasamaya Manushya is similar
to that of a Narayik. * **Aprathmasamaya Manushya:** The interval between births
of an Aprathmasamaya Manushya is similar to that of a Narayik. * **Prathmasamaya
Deva:** The interval between births of a Prathmasamaya Deva is similar to that
of a Narayik. * **Aprathmasamaya Deva:** The interval between births of an
Aprathmasamaya Deva is similar to that of a Narayik.  **Frequency of Birth
(अल्पबहुत्व)**  The frequency of birth is not explicitly mentioned in this text.
This concludes the discussion of the eight types of beings who have attained
liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

## 152] This is the Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra. The term "Samaya-Adhikta" (excess
time) is used because the first time is more. In some places, only "Antar-
Muhurta" (inner moment) is mentioned; in this statement, the first time is also
included in the "Antar-Muhurta," hence it is not mentioned separately.   The
difference from the peak is the "Vanaspatikala" (plant-time). In the "Tiryanch-
Yoni" (animal realm), the lowest difference from the first time is the
"Kshullak-Bhava-Grahan" (minor birth-absorption) of two "Kshallaka" (moments).
These "Kshullaka" are due to the expectation of being born again in the animal
realm after being obstructed from the "Manushya-Bhava-Grahan" (human birth-
absorption). One "Bhava" is the "Tiryanch-Kshullak-Bhava" (animal minor birth-
absorption) less than the first time, and the other is the "Kshullak-Bhava-
Grahan" (minor birth-absorption) of the entire human being. The difference from
the peak is the "Vanaspatikala" (plant-time). After its passing, there is an
expectation of being born again as a "Pratham-Samaya-Tiryanch" (first-time
animal) due to the obstruction of the "Manushya-Bhava" (human birth).   The
lowest difference from the "A-Pratham-Samaya-Tiryanch-Yoni" (non-first-time
animal realm) is the "Samaya-Adhik-Kshullak-Bhava-Grahan" (excess-time minor
birth-absorption). This should be understood as the "Tiryanch-Yoni-Kshullak-
Bhava-Grahan" (animal realm minor birth-absorption) taking the maximum time,
considering it as the "A-Pratham-Samaya" (non-first-time), and after dying in
it, the "Kshullak-Bhava-Grahan" (minor birth-absorption) of a human being, and
then the expectation of the first time passing after being born again in the
animal realm.   The difference from the peak is the "Sa-Adhik-Sagara-Upam-Shat-
Prithaktva" (ocean-like hundred-fold separation). This is due to the expectation
of being born again in the animal realm after wandering in the "Deva-Adi-Bhava"
(heavenly realms) for so long.   The "Vaktvyata" (speech) of humans is according
to the "Tiryanch-Vaktvyata" (animal speech). Only there should the obstruction
be said to be the "Tiryanch-Bhava" (animal birth). The speech of the "Deva"
(gods) is the same as that of the "Nairyika" (hell beings). The "Alp-Bahutva"
(small multitude) is said for the "Pratham-Alp-Bahutva" (first small multitude)
of the "Pratham-Samaya-Nairyika" (first-time hell beings) up to the "Pratham-
Samaya-Deva" (first-time gods).   This is as follows: The fewest are the
"Pratham-Samaya-Manushya" (first-time humans). They are like the "Prakash-
Pradesh" (regions of light) in the innumerable parts of the category. The
"Pratham-Samaya-Nairyika" (first-time hell beings) are innumerable times more
than them, because they can be born in great abundance at one time. The
"Pratham-Samaya-Deva" (first-time gods) are innumerable times more than them -
the "Vyantar-Jyotishka-Deva" (intermediate luminous gods) can be born in even
greater abundance at one time. The "Pratham-Samaya-Tiryanch" (first-time
animals) are innumerable times more than them. Here, those who have come from
the three "Gati" (paths) of "Naraka" (hell), etc., and are present in the
"Pratham-Samaya" (first-time) of the "Tiryanch" (animal realm), are the
"Pratham-Samaya-Tiryanch" (first-time animals), not the others.   Therefore,
although the innumerable part of the "Pratinigodi" (non-returner) is always in
the "Pratham-Samaya" (first-time) of the "Vigraha-Gati" (path of
disintegration), they are not "Pratham-Samaya-Tiryanch" (first-time animals)
because they are also "Tiryanch" (animals). They are only a countable number of
times more than them.   The second "Alp-Bahutva" (small multitude) is said for
the "A-Pratham-Samaya-Nairyika" (non-first-time hell beings) up to the
"A-Pratham-Samaya-Deva" (non-first-time gods). It is as follows: The fewest are
the "A-Pratham-Samaya-Manushya" (non-first-time humans), because they are as
many as the innumerable parts of the category.   The "A-Pratham-Samaya-Nairyika"
(non-first-time hell beings) are innumerable times more than them, because they
are as many as the "Pradesh-Rashi" (number of regions) obtained by multiplying
the second square root by the first square root of the "Pradesh-Rashi" (number
of regions) of the "Angul-Matra-Kshetra" (finger-sized area) in as many
categories as there are "Akasha-Pradesh" (regions of space). The "A-Pratham-
Samaya-Deva" (non-first-time gods) are innumerable times more than them, because
the "Vyantar-Jyotishka-Deva" (intermediate luminous gods) are also very
abundant.   The "A-Pratham-Samaya-Tiryanch" (non-first-time animals) are
infinite times more than them, because the "Vanaspatikaya" (plant bodies) are
infinite. The third "Alp-Bahutva" (small multitude) is for the "Pratham-Samaya"
(first-time) and "A-Pratham-Samaya" (non-first-time) in each "Narathika" (hell
being), etc. It is as follows: The fewest are the "Pratham-Samaya-Nairyika"
(first-time hell beings), because even though they are born in countless numbers
at one time, ...

[The Seventh Principle of the Eightfold Path] [There are 153 verses / The number
of first-time beings is very small, because they are ephemeral and are born in
great numbers only for a short time. This is also true for the beings in the
animal, human, and celestial realms. It is especially true for the animal realm,
where the number of first-time animal beings is infinite, because the number of
plant beings is infinite. The fourth principle, the principle of fewness, states
that the number of first-time beings in hell, etc., is very small. The number of
first-time human beings is the smallest, because even though they are born in
great numbers, they are still few in number / The number of non-first-time human
beings is countless times greater than the number of first-time human beings,
because they are long-lasting and are born in great numbers / The number of
first-time non-human beings is countless times greater than the number of non-
first-time human beings, because they are born in great numbers at one time. The
number of first-time celestial beings is countless times greater than the number
of first-time non-human beings, because they are born in great numbers in the
intermediate and luminous realms / The number of first-time animal beings is
countless times greater than the number of first-time celestial beings, because
beings are born from the three paths of hell, etc. The number of non-first-time
non-human beings is countless times greater than the number of first-time animal
beings, because they are equal to the number of categories in the square root of
the second square root of the area of a space the size of an angul. The number
of non-first-time animal beings is infinite, because the number of plant beings
is infinite. Thus, the Seventh Principle, which describes the eightfold path of
the world, is complete. // Thus ends the Seventh Principle //]

duration for all these types is an **antarmuhūrta** (a moment between two
muhūrtas). The longest duration is:  * **Pṛthvīkāyika:** 22,000 years *
**Apakāyika:** 7,000 years * **Tejaskaayika:** 3 days * **Vāyukāyika:** 3,000
years * **Vanaspatikāyika:** 10,000 years * **Dvīndriya:** 12 years *
**Trīndriya:** 49 days * **Caturindriya:** 6 months * **Pañcendriya:** 33
sagaropama (a measure of time equivalent to 33 oceans)  **Accumulation:**  The
shortest accumulation (duration of existence) for all these types is an
**antarmuhūrta**. The longest accumulation is:  * **Pṛthvīkāyika:** Asankhyeya
kāla (an immeasurable period of time encompassing countless cycles of upsurge
and downsurge, and countless regions of space within the universe) *
**Apakāyika, Tejaskaayika, Vāyukāyika:** Similar to Pṛthvīkāyika *
**Vanaspatikāyika:** Ananta kāla (infinite time) encompassing countless cycles
of upsurge and downsurge, countless regions of space within the universe, and
countless transformations of pudgala (matter) * **Dvīndriya, Trīndriya,
Caturindriya:** Sankhyeya kāla (measurable time) * **Pañcendriya:** 1,000
sagaropama  **Interval:**  The shortest interval (time between births) for
**Pṛthvīkāyika** is an **antarmuhūrta**, and the longest is **ananta kāla**
(infinite time). This infinite time is similar to the previous explanation. The
interval between a Pṛthvīkāyika leaving its body and being reborn as a
Vanaspatikāyika is ananta kāla. The interval for other types should be
understood similarly.  The shortest interval for **Vanaspatikāyika** is an
**antarmuhūrta**, and the longest is **asankhyeya kāla** (immeasurable time)
encompassing countless cycles of upsurge and downsurge.  **Number:**  *
**Pañcendriya** are the least numerous, existing in a number equal to countless
regions of space within the universe, each region being countless yojanas (a
measure of distance) in diameter. * **Caturindriya** are more numerous than
Pañcendriya, existing in a number equal to countless yojanas in diameter. *
**Trīndriya** are more numerous than Caturindriya, existing in a number equal to
countless yojanas in diameter. * **Dvīndriya** are more numerous than Trīndriya,
existing in a number equal to countless yojanas in diameter. * **Tejaskaayika**
are countless times more numerous than Dvīndriya, existing in a number equal to
countless regions of space within the universe. * **Pṛthvīkāyika** are more
numerous than Tejaskaayika, existing in a number equal to countless regions of
space within the universe. * **Apakāyika** are more numerous than Pṛthvīkāyika,
existing in a number equal to countless regions of space within the universe. *
**Vāyukāyika** are more numerous than Apakāyika, existing in a number equal to
countless regions of space within the universe. * **Vanaspatikāyika** are
infinitely more numerous than Vāyukāyika, existing in a number equal to infinite
regions of space within the universe.  **Conclusion:**  This is the eighth
understanding, which explains the nine types of liberation.

The ninth attainment of the tenfold classification [157. The accumulation (body
state) of the first-time beings is one time less than the lowest and one time
more than the highest / The accumulation (body state) of the non-first-time
beings is one time less than the lowest, a small-being-grasp, and the highest is

three-sensed, and four-sensed, and the saadic thousand-ocean-like period of the
five-sensed. 230. What is the difference between the first-time one-sensed
beings? Gautama! The lowest is two small-being-grasps less than the time, and
the highest is the plant-period. The difference between the non-first-time one-
sensed beings is one small-being-grasp more than the time, and the highest is
two thousand ocean-like years of countable-period. _The difference between all

first-time beings and the non-first-time beings are countless times numerous /
Thus, Venerable Sir! Is there any difference between the first-time one-sensed,
the non-first-time one-sensed, and the non-first-time four-sensed, whether it is
less, more, equal, or special? Gautama! The first-time four-sensed are special,
the first-time three-sensed are special, the first-time two-sensed are special,
and so on down to the first-time one-sensed are special, the non-first-time
five-sensed are countless times numerous, the non-first-time four-sensed are
special, and so on down to the non-first-time one-sensed are infinitely numerous

English translation preserving Jain terms:  The Jivajivabhigama Sutra states
that the Prathamasamaya Ekendriya (one-sensed beings in the first moment) and
the Aprathamasamaya Ekendriya (one-sensed beings not in the first moment) are
infinitely different in number. The rest, i.e., the Prathamasamaya beings of
other senses, are the least in number, while the Aprathamasamaya beings of other
senses are innumerable.  O Lord! Among the Prathamasamaya Ekendriya,
Aprathamasamaya Ekendriya, and so on up to the Aprathamasamaya Panchendriya
(five-sensed beings not in the first moment), which are less, more, equal, or
specially superior to one another?  Gautama! The Prathamasamaya Panchendriya are
the least in number. The Prathamasamaya Chaturindriya (four-sensed beings in the
first moment) are specially superior to them, the Prathamasamaya Treendriya
(three-sensed beings in the first moment) are specially superior to the
Chaturindriya, the Prathamasamaya Dwindriya (two-sensed beings in the first
moment) are specially superior to the Treendriya, and the Prathamasamaya
Ekendriya are specially superior to the Dwindriya. The Aprathamasamaya
Panchendriya are innumerable times more than the Prathamasamaya Ekendriya, the
Aprathamasamaya Chaturindriya are specially superior to the Aprathamasamaya
Panchendriya, the Aprathamasamaya Treendriya are specially superior to the
Aprathamasamaya Chaturindriya, the Aprathamasamaya Dwindriya are specially
superior to the Aprathamasamaya Treendriya, and the Aprathamasamaya Ekendriya
are infinitely more than the Aprathamasamaya Dwindriya.  Thus, the description
of the ten types of Samsarasamapannaka (beings who have attained liberation) is
complete. The Samsarasamapannaka Jivabhigama (description of liberated beings)
is fully explained. The vivechana (analysis) presented in this text mentions ten
types of Samsarasamapannaka beings, which are obtained by making two divisions
each of the Ekendriya, Dwindriya, Treendriya, Chaturindriya, and Panchendriya -
one division for the Prathamasamaya (first moment) and the other for the
Aprathamasamaya (not in the first moment).  The Prathamasamaya Ekendriya are
those who exist in the first moment of one-sensedness, while the rest of the
Ekendriya are Aprathamasamaya Ekendriya. Similarly, one should understand the
case of the Dwindriya and other senses.  The sthiti (duration), sanchittana
(bodily state), antara (interval), and alpabahutvam (less or more) of the
aforementioned ten types are expounded in this text. The jhaghanya (minimum) and
utkrishta (maximum) sthiti of the Prathamasamaya Ekendriya is one moment, as
they do not remain in the Prathamasamaya in other moments. Similarly, one should
understand the case of the Prathamasamaya Dwindriya and others.  The jhaghanya
sthiti of the Aprathamasamaya Ekendriya is one moment less than the
Ksullakabhava (256 Shravalikas). The utkrishta sthiti is one moment less than
22,000 years. The jhaghanya sthiti of the Aprathamasamaya Dwindriya is one
moment less than the Ksullakabhavagrahana, and the utkrishta sthiti is 12 years.
The jhaghanya sthiti of the Aprathamasamaya Treendriya is one moment less than
the Ksullakabhava, and the utkrishta sthiti is 49 days. The jhaghanya sthiti of
the Aprathamasamaya Chaturindriya is one moment less than the Ksullakabhava, and
the utkrishta sthiti is 6 months. The jhaghanya sthiti of the Aprathamasamaya
Panchendriya is one moment less than the Ksullakabhava, and the utkrishta sthiti
is 33 Sagaropamas.  The sanchittana (bodily state) of the Prathamasamaya
Ekendriya lasts for one moment in the same form. After that, it no longer
remains in the Prathamasamaya. Similarly, one should understand the case of the
Prathamasamaya Dwindriya and others.  The jhaghanya sthiti of the
Aprathamasamaya Ekendriya lasts up to the Ksullakabhavagrahana, after which it
can be born elsewhere. The utkrishta sthiti is for an infinite duration, which
should be understood as the infinite cycle of Avasarpini and Utsarpini.  The
jhaghanya sthiti of the Aprathamasamaya Dwindriya is one moment less than the
Ksullakabhava, and the utkrishta sthiti is for a countable duration, after which
it must be born elsewhere. Similarly, one should understand the case of the
Aprathamasamaya Treendriya and Chaturindriya.

## The Ninth Attainment of the Tenfold Knowledge  **[159 The First-Time Five-
Sensory Being]**  The lifespan of a First-Time Five-Sensory being ranges from a
minimum of two *ksullakabhava* (brief existences) to a maximum of a thousand
*sagaropama* (ocean-like periods), as they can only remain in the Five-Sensory
state for this duration while continuously transmigrating through the realms of
gods and others.  **[The Interval of the First-Time One-Sensory Being]**  The
interval of the First-Time One-Sensory being is two *ksullakabhava* at the
minimum. These *ksullakabhava* are due to the obstruction of the *ksullakabhava*
of the Two-Sensory and higher beings, which prevents them from being reborn as
One-Sensory beings again. For example, one *ksullakabhava* is the
*ksullakabhava* of the First-Time One-Sensory being, and the other is the entire
*ksullakabhava* of the Two-Sensory and higher beings. Thus, one should
understand that there are two *ksullakabhava* at the minimum.  The maximum
interval is the *vanaspatikala* (plant-like period) to infinity, which has been
explained previously. For this duration, it is a Non-First-Time One-Sensory
being, not a First-Time One-Sensory being. Because when a being remains in the
*ksullakabhava* of the Two-Sensory and higher beings and is then reborn as a
One-Sensory being, it is called a First-Time One-Sensory being in the First-
Time. Therefore, the maximum interval is called the *vanaspatikala*.  The
minimum interval of the Non-First-Time One-Sensory being is the *ksullakabhava*
of the *samayadhika* (time-exceeding). It is obtained when the being dies in the
*charamasamaya* (final time) of the One-Sensory state, and due to the
obstruction of the *ksullakabhava* of the Two-Sensory and higher beings, it is
reborn as a One-Sensory being again after the First-Time of the One-Sensory
state has passed. This duration is the interval of the Non-First-Time One-
Sensory being.  The maximum interval can be two thousand *sagaropama* plus a
*sankhyeya* (countable) number of years. The transmigration through the realms
of the Two-Sensory and higher beings is only possible for this duration.  **[The
Interval of the First-Time Two-Sensory Being]**  The minimum interval of the
First-Time Two-Sensory being is two *ksullakabhava*. One is the *ksullakabhava*
of the Non-First-Time Two-Sensory being, and the other is any *ksullakabhava* of
the entire One-Sensory, Three-Sensory, and higher beings. Similarly, one should
understand the intervals of the First-Time Three-Sensory, First-Time Four-
Sensory, and First-Time Five-Sensory beings.  **[The Interval of the Non-First-
Time Two-Sensory Being]**  The minimum interval of the Non-First-Time Two-
Sensory being is the *ksullakabhava* of the *samayadhika*. It is obtained when
the being remains in the *ksullakabhava* of other beings and is reborn as a Two-
Sensory being again after the First-Time of the Two-Sensory state has passed.
The maximum interval is infinity. This infinity is the infinity of the past
*utsarpini* (ascending) and *pravasarpini* (descending) cycles. It should be
stated that this interval is obtained after the being exits the Two-Sensory
state, remains in the plant-like state for this duration, and is reborn as a
Two-Sensory being again after the First-Time has passed.  One should understand
the minimum and maximum intervals of the Non-First-Time Three-Sensory, Four-
Sensory, and Five-Sensory beings.  **[The First Fewness]**  The first fewness is
stated with respect to the First-Time beings. It is as follows:  The fewest are
the First-Time Five-Sensory beings, because they are born in small numbers at a
time. The First-Time Four-Sensory beings are more numerous than them, because
they are born in greater numbers at a time. The First-Time Three-Sensory beings
are more numerous than them, because they are born in even greater numbers at a
time. The First-Time Two-Sensory beings are more numerous than them, because
they are born in the greatest numbers at a time. The First-Time One-Sensory
beings are more numerous than them.  Here, one should understand that the First-
Time One-Sensory beings are those who are born as One-Sensory beings after
exiting the Two-Sensory and higher beings and are present in the First-Time, not
others. They are more numerous than the First-Time Two-Sensory beings, but not
by an immeasurable or infinite amount.

[160] The second *alpabahutva* (scarcity) is stated with respect to the
*aprathamasamayika* (non-first-time) souls. It is as follows: The fewest are the
*aprathamasamaya* (non-first-time) *panchendriya* (five-sensed) souls, then the
*aprathamasamaya* *chaturindriya* (four-sensed) souls are more numerous, then
the *aprathamasamaya* *triindriya* (three-sensed) souls are more numerous, then
the *aprathamasamaya* *dviindriya* (two-sensed) souls are more numerous, then
the *aprathamasamaya* *ekendriya* (one-sensed) souls are infinitely numerous.
The third *alpabahutva* is with respect to the *prathamasamaya* (first-time) and
*aprathamasamaya* souls in each *ekendriya* etc. It is as follows: The fewest
are the *prathamasamaya* *ekendriya* souls, because they are born in a single
time period from the *dviindriya* etc. The *aprathamasamaya* *ekendriya* souls
are infinitely numerous, because the *vanaspatikala* (plant-like state) is
infinite. Among the *dviindriya* souls, the fewest are the *prathamasamaya*
*dviindriya* souls, the *aprathamasamaya* *dviindriya* souls are innumerable
times more numerous, because the *dviindriya* souls are innumerable even by
number. Similarly, among the *triindriya*, *chaturindriya*, and *panchendriya*
souls, the *prathamasamaya* souls are fewer and the *aprathamasamaya* souls are
innumerable times more numerous. The fourth *alpabahutva* is stated with respect
to the aforementioned ten categories. It is as follows: The fewest are the
*prathamasamaya* *panchendriya* souls, then the *prathamasamaya* *chaturindriya*
souls are more numerous, then the *prathamasamaya* *triindriya* souls are more
numerous, then the *prathamasamaya* *dviindriya* souls are more numerous, then
the *prathamasamaya* *ekendriya* souls are more numerous, then the
*aprathamasamaya* *panchendriya* souls are innumerable times more numerous, then
the *aprathamasamaya* *chaturindriya* souls are more numerous, then the
*aprathamasamaya* *triindriya* souls are more numerous, then the
*aprathamasamaya* *dviindriya* souls are more numerous, then the
*aprathamasamaya* *ekendriya* souls are infinitely numerous. The reasoning is
clear. Thus, the ten types of *pratipatti* (understanding) are complete. With
their completion, the *jivaabhigam* (approach of the soul) that leads to the
cessation of the cycle of birth and death is also complete. 00

After expounding on the ten types of attainments of the liberated souls
(samsarasamaapannak jivas), we now discuss the concept of Sarvajivaabhigam. This
Sarvajivaabhigam encompasses both the liberated souls (samsarasamaapannak) and
the non-liberated souls (asamsarasamaapannak). 231.  "O Bhagavan! What is
Sarvajivaabhigam?" "Gautama! There are nine types of attainments in
Sarvajivaabhigam. Some say that all jivas are of two types, and some say that
they are of ten types." "Those who say that all jivas are of two types, say that
they are Siddha and Asiddha." "O Bhagavan! How long can a Siddha remain as a
Siddha?" "Gautama! A Siddha is Saadi-Apayavasit (eternal)." "O Bhagavan! How
long can an Asiddha remain as an Asiddha?" "Gautama! An Asiddha is of two types:
Pranai-Apayavasit and Pranai-Sapayavasit." "O Bhagavan! What is the difference
between a Siddha and an Asiddha?" "Gautama! There is no difference between a
Saadi-Apayavasit and a Siddha." "O Bhagavan! What is the difference between an
Asiddha and a Siddha?" "Gautama! There is no difference between a Pranai-
Apayavasit and an Asiddha. There is no difference between a Pranai-Sapayavasit
and an Asiddha." "O Bhagavan! How many times are the Siddhas and Asiddhas born
and reborn?" "Gautama! The Siddhas are eternal, and the Asiddhas are infinite in
number." 231.

## 162] [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra Bhagavan! How long does an Asiddha, a Prasiddha,
remain as such? Gautama! There are two types of Prasiddha Jivas: Anadi-A
paryavasit and Anadi-Sapyaravasit. (Anadi-A paryavasit Prasiddha remains
Prasiddha forever, and Anadi-Sapyaravasit remains in the Asiddha form until
attaining liberation.) Bhagavan! What is the difference between a Siddha and a
Prasiddha? Gautama! There is no difference between a Sadi-A paryavasit and a
Prasiddha. Bhagavan! What is the difference between an Asiddha and a Prasiddha?
Gautama! There is no difference between an Anadi-A paryavasit Prasiddha and an
Anadi-Sapyaravasit Prasiddha. Bhagavan! Among these Siddhas and Prasiddhas, who
is less, more, equal or superior to whom? Gautama! Siddhas are the fewest, and
Prasiddhas are infinitely more numerous than them.   **Explanation:** Just as
nine types of Prathipattis are mentioned in the context of the Jivas who are
involved in the ending of the world, similarly, nine Prathipattis are also
mentioned in the context of all Jivas. All Jivas include both worldly and
liberated Jivas. Therefore, all Jivas are included in these nine Prathipattis.
These nine Prathipattis are as follows:  (1) Some say that all Jivas are of two
types, namely Siddha and Prasiddha. (2) Some say that all Jivas are of three
types, namely Samyagdristi, Mithyadristi and Samyagmithyadristi. (3) Some say
that all Jivas are of four types, namely Manayogi, Vachanayogi, Kayayogi and
Ayogi. (4) Some say that all Jivas are of five types, namely Narayik, Tiryanch,
Manushya, Deva and Siddha. (5) Some say that all Jivas are of six types, namely
Audarikashariri, Vaikriyasariri, Paharakashariri, Tejasashariri, Karmanashariri
and Ashariri. (6) Some say that all Jivas are of seven types, namely
Prithvikaayik, Apkaayik, Tejaskaayik, Vayukaayik, Vanaspatikaayik, Traskaayik
and Prakaayik. (7) Some say that all Jivas are of eight types, namely Matijnani,
Shrutajnani, Avadhijnani, Manahparyayajnani, केवलज्ञानी, Mati-Ajnani, Shruta-
Ajnani and Vibhangajnani. (8) Some say that all Jivas are of nine types, namely
Ekeindriya, Dwiindriya, Triindriya, Chaturindriya, Nairyik, Tiryanch, Manushya,
Deva and Siddha. (9) Some say that all Jivas are of ten types, namely
Prithvikaayik, Apkaayik, Tejaskaayik, Vayukaayik, Vanaspatikaayik, Dwiindriya,
Triindriya, Chaturindriya, Panchendriya and Atiindriya.  From these nine
Prathipattis, other distinctions have also been made with different
interpretations, which will be mentioned in their respective places. Those who
say that all Jivas are of two types, mean that all Jivas are included in these
two categories: Siddha and Prasiddha. Those who have described eight types of
bound karma...

"All beings are classified into two categories: Siddhas and Prasiddhas. Those
who have completely shed the bonds of karma are Siddhas. Those who have not been
freed from the bonds of the world and karma are Prasiddhas. Siddhas always
remain immersed in their own nature, therefore their existence in time is not
mentioned. Their state of being, i.e., their state of Siddhatva, remains
forever. Siddhas are eternal and imperishable, meaning they have a beginning in
Siddhatva and never cease to be Siddhas. There are two types of Prasiddhas:
Anadi-Apayavasi and Anadi-Sapayavasi. Those who will never become Siddhas due to
their being Abhavya or due to the influence of such material, are known as
Anadi-Apayavasi Prasiddhas. Those who will attain Siddhi are Anadi-Sapayavasi,
meaning they will end their endless cycle of birth and death. Until they attain
liberation, they remain as Prasiddhas. Siddhas do not become Prasiddhas again
after attaining Siddhatva, therefore there is no difference between them. They
are eternal and imperishable, hence there is no difference. Among Prasiddhas,
those who are Anadi-Apayavasi will never cease to be Prasiddhas, therefore there
is no difference. Those who are Anadi-Sapayavasi also have no difference,
because there is no rebirth after liberation. Siddhas are few in number, while
Prasiddhas are infinite, because the number of Nigoda Jeevas is immense.  There
are two categories of all beings, as follows: Saindhiya and Anidhiya.
"Bhagavan, how long does the Saindhiya state last?"  "Saindhiya is classified
into two categories: Anadi-Apayavasi and Anadi-Sapayavasi.  "Anidhiya is
classified into two categories: Sadi-Apayavasi and Sadi-Sapayavasi. There is a
difference between the two.  "Anidhiya are countless, while Saindhiya are
infinite.  There are two categories of all beings, as follows: Sakaiya and
Akainya.  "Similarly, there are two categories of all beings: Sajogi and Ajoigi.
Similarly, there are two categories of all beings: Salesa and Alesa. Similarly,
there are two categories of all beings: Sasaroara and Prasaroara.  "The
difference between these categories is due to the difference in the number of
beings, as in the case of Saindhiya.  There are two categories of all beings, as
follows: Savedaga and Avedaga.  "Bhagavan, how long does the Savedaga state
last?"  "Savedaga is classified into three categories: Anadi-Apayavasi, Anadi-
Sapayavasi, and Sadi-Sapayavasi.  "Among these, those who are Sadi-Sapayavasi
will experience the end of their cycle of birth and death for an infinite period
of time, until they attain the state of liberation and become a liberated soul.
"Bhagavan, how long does the Avedaga state last?"  "Avedaga is classified into
two categories: Sadi-Apayavasi and Sadi-Sapayavasi.  "Among these, those who are
Sadi-Sapayavasi will experience the end of their cycle of birth and death for a
single period of time.  "Bhagavan, what is the difference in time between these
states?"  "There is a difference in time for those who are Anadi-Apayavasi.
There is no difference in time for those who are Anadi-Sapayavasi.  "Those who
are Sadi-Sapayavasi will experience the end of their cycle of birth and death
for a single period of time.  "Those who have shed the eight types of karma,
which are bound and have been burnt to ashes, are Siddhas."

##  [165]  The two-fold understanding of Sarvajivaabhigam is presented in this
sutra, with its various aspects. In the previous sutra, two distinctions were
made based on Siddhatva and Prasiddhatva. This sutra explains the duality of
Sarvajivaabhigam based on:  * **Indriya-Anindriya** (Sensory-Non-sensory) *
**Sakayik-Akayik** (With Body-Without Body) * **Sayogi-Ayogi** (With Karma-
Without Karma) * **Seleshya-Aleshya** (With Body-Without Body) * **Savaidaka-
Avaidaka** (With Knowledge-Without Knowledge) * **Sakshayik-Akshayik** (With
Karma-Without Karma)  According to the commentator, the mention of Seleshya-
Aleshya and Sasheera-Asheera comes after Sayogi-Ayogi, while the original text
has a separate sutra for Seleshya-Aleshya at the end.  These two categories of
Sarvajiva have **Upaadhi** (with attributes) and **Anupaadhikrit** (without
attributes) distinctions. Due to **Karmajanaya-Upaadhi** (attributes arising
from Karma), the sensory, with body, with karma, with body, with knowledge, and
with karma beings are called **Samsari Jiva** (worldly beings). While those
without Karmajanaya-Upaadhi are called **Siddh Jiva** (liberated beings) as they
are non-sensory, without body, without karma, without body, without knowledge,
and without karma.  The **Kayasthiti** (state of body) and **Antar**
(difference) of the sensory should be explained according to the
**Prasiddhatva** (known) and the **Anindriya** (non-sensory) should be explained
according to the **Siddhatva** (liberated). It is as follows:  **"O Bhagavan!
How long does the sensory being remain as sensory?"**  **"O Gautam! There are
two types of sensory beings: Anaadi-Aparyavasit (eternal) and Anaadi-
Saparyavasit (with beginning and end)."**  **"O Bhagavan! How long does the non-
sensory being remain as non-sensory?"**  **"O Gautam! It is Saadi-Aparyavasit
(eternal)."**  **"O Bhagavan! What is the difference between the sensory and
non-sensory in terms of time?"**  **"O Gautam! There is no difference in Anaadi-
Aparyavasit (eternal) and Anaadi-Saparyavasit (with beginning and end). There is
no difference in Saadi-Aparyavasit (eternal)."**  **"What is the difference in
the non-sensory?"**  **"O Gautam! There is no difference in Saadi-Aparyavasit
(eternal)."**  The non-sensory are few in number, while the sensory are
countless, as the sensory beings include the plant life, which is infinite.
Similarly, the **Kayasthiti** (state of body), **Antar** (difference), and
**Alpbahutva** (fewness) of the beings with body, with karma, with body, with
knowledge, and with karma should be explained in the same way as the sensory and
non-sensory.  However, the **Savaidaka-Avaidaka** (with knowledge-without
knowledge) and **Sakshayik-Akshayik** (with karma-without karma) have special
characteristics and require separate explanation.  It is said that the
**Savaidaka** (with knowledge) are of three types:  1. **Anaadi-Aparyavasit**
(eternal) 2. **Anaadi-Saparyavasit** (with beginning and end) 3. **Saadi-
Saparyavasit** (with beginning and end)  The **Anaadi-Aparyavasit** (eternal)
**Savaidaka** (with knowledge) are either **Abhavy Jiva** (non-liberated beings)
or those who will not attain liberation due to the lack of necessary materials.
This is because many **Bhavy Jiva** (liberated beings) do not become **Siddh**
(liberated).  The **Anaadi-Saparyavasit** (with beginning and end) **Savaidaka**
(with knowledge) is a **Bhavy Jiva** (liberated being) who is on the path to
liberation and has not yet attained the **Upshama Shreni** (stage of
liberation).  The **Saadi-Saparyavasit** (with beginning and end) **Savaidaka**
(with knowledge) is a **Bhavy Jiva** (liberated being) who is on the path to
liberation and has already attained the **Upshama Shreni** (stage of
liberation).  After attaining the **Upshama Shreni** (stage of liberation), they
experience **Avaidakatva** (without knowledge) in the **Vedopshama** (stage of
liberation) and die in the **Apantaaral** (interval between death and rebirth)
due to **Bhavakshaya** (destruction of karma) or fall back from the **Upshama
Shreni** (stage of liberation).  **"Bhaavaavi Na Sihjanti Kei"** (They do not
attain liberation) - This is the statement.

The *jiva* (soul) becomes aware (savadak) due to the *vedodaya* (awakening of
knowledge) of the *jivajivaabhigamsutra* (the sutra on the interaction of
souls). This aware *jiva* is *saadi-sapyavast* (having attained the state of
*saadi* and *sapyavast*). The *kayasthiti* (state of being) of this *saadi-
sapyavast* *savadak* is *jghanya* (inferior) and *antarmuhurt* (momentary). This
is because after becoming aware at the end of the *shreni* (category), the
*jiva* can again ascend the *shreni* and become unaware (*avedak*). There may be
a doubt whether a *jiva* can attain the *upshamshreni* (category of liberation)
twice in one birth. The solution is that the *upshamshreni* can be attained
twice, but the *upshamshreni* and *kshapkasreni* (category of destruction)
cannot be attained in one birth.  The *kayasthiti* of the *saadi-sapyavast*
*savadak* is *utkarsh* (superior) and *anantakal* (eternal). This eternal state
is *ananta* (infinite) *utsarpini-avsarpin* (ascending-descending) in terms of
*kalamargna* (time-path) and *deshon* (region) *apardha-pudgal-paravart* (half-
pudgala-reflection) in terms of *kshetramargna* (space-path). After this long
period, the *jiva* who had attained the *upshamshreni* can attain the *shreni*
and become *avedak* by becoming *aasannamukti* (near liberation).  There is no
*sanchittana* (accumulation) for *anaadi-apyavast* (eternal unaware) and
*anaadi-sapyavast* (eternal aware). When asked about the *avedak*, it is said
that there are two types of *avedak*: *saadi-apyavast* (eternal unaware) with
*kshinaved* (diminished knowledge) and *saadi-sapyavast* (eternal aware) with
*upshantved* (quieted knowledge). The *sanchittana* of the *saadi-sapyavast*
*avedak* is *jghanya* (inferior) and *ek samaya* (one time), which is the time
of death after attaining the *upshamshreni* and *vedopshaman* (cessation of
knowledge). The *utkarsh* (superior) is *antarmuhurt* (momentary), because the
time of *upshamshreni* is only that much. After this, the *jiva* becomes
*savadak* due to *patan* (fall).  There is no difference for the *anaadi-
apyavast* *savadak*, because due to *apyavast* (eternal unaware), that state is
never abandoned. There is also no difference for the *anaadi-sapyavast*
*savadak*, because in the *anaadi-sapyavast* *apantaral* (eternal aware
interval), the *jiva* does not attain the *upshamshreni* but becomes a future
*kshinaved* (diminished knowledge). There is no possibility of the *kshinaved*
becoming *savadak* again, because there is no *pratipat* (rebirth) in it. The
difference for the *saadi-sapyavast* *savadak* is *jghanya* (inferior) and *ek
samaya* (one time), because it is possible for someone to die after
*vedopshaman* (cessation of knowledge) in the time after attaining the
*upshamshreni* for the second time. The *utkarsh* (superior) is *antarmuhurt*
(momentary), because after attaining the *upshamshreni* for the second time, it
is possible to become *savadak* again after the *antarmuhurt* (momentary) time
of the *shreni* ends.  In the *avedak sutra*, there is no difference for the
*saadi-apyavast* *avedak*, because the *jiva* with *kshinaved* (diminished
knowledge) does not become *savadak* again. The difference for the *saadi-
sapyavast* *avedak* is *jghanya* (inferior) to *antarmuhurt* (momentary),
because after becoming *savadak* at the end of the *upshamshreni*, it is
possible to attain the *upshamshreni* for the second time in the *antarmuhurt*
(momentary) and become *avedak*. The *utkarsh* (superior) difference is
*anantakal* (eternal). That eternal state is *ananta* (infinite) *utsarpini-
avsarpin* (ascending-descending) and *deshon* (region) *apardha-pudgal-paravart*
(half-pudgala-reflection) in terms of *kshetramargna* (space-path), because
after attaining the *upshamshreni* once and becoming *avedak* there, it is
possible to attain the *shreni* again after such a long time and become *avedak*
again after the end of the *shreni*.  One should know the *alp-bahutva* (few-
many) of these, that is, the *avedak* are few and the *savadak* are infinite, in
comparison to the infinity of *vanaspatijiva* (plant-life). 1. And also,
according to the *moola-tika-kar* (original commentator): "The *upshamshreni*
and *kshapkasreni* are not born in the same birth, but two *upshamshreni* can be
born."

All beings are of two types: **Saksayik** and **Aksayik**. This is the same
statement that should be made about **Svedak** and **Avedak**. 233. Or, all
beings are of two types: **Gnani** and **Agnani**.  O Bhagavan! How long does a
**Gnani** remain as a **Gnani**? Gautama! **Gnani** are of two types: **Sadi-

understood as **Mithyagnani**.  /  **Gnani** are of two types: **Sadi-

least **Antarmuhurt** to the most sixty-four **Sagaropama**.  The least state of

[168] The *Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra* is a little more than the *Sagaropama*,
therefore the *Jnani's* excellent *Sanchittana* is said to be a little more than
sixty-six *Sagaropama*. This situation is from the perspective of going to
*Vijayadi* etc. without falling from *Samyaktva*. As it is said in the
commentary, going to the *Vijayadi* plane twice or to the *Achyuta* heaven three
times, the time of sixty-six *Sagaropama* and the time of human births is
counted in the *Sadhika*, from which the said situation arises.  While
describing the *Sanchiguna* of the *Agnani*, it is said that there are three
types of *Agnani*... *Anadi-Aparyavasit*, *Anadi-Saparyavasit* and *Sadi-
Saparyavasit*. The *Anadi-Aparyavasit* *Agnani* is one who will never go to
*Moksha*. The *Anadi-Saparyavasit* *Agnani* is one who will attain *Samyaktva*
with *Anadi-Mithyadristi* and will fall from it and attain the *Kshapaka*
series. The *Sadi-Saparyavasit* *Agnani* is one who has become *Samyagdristi*
and then become *Mithyadristi*. Such an *Agnani* can become *Samyagdristi* again
after staying in it for a short time, from this perspective, his *Sanchittana*
is said to be a short time and from the perspective of excellence, it is
infinite time, which is in the form of infinite *Utsarpini* and *Avasarpini* and
from the perspective of the field, it is *Deshon* *Aparthapudgalparavarta*.  The
*Antardwar-Sadi-Aparyavasit* *Jnani* does not have a difference, because being
*Aparyavasit*, he never abandons that form. The *Sadi-Saparyavasit* *Jnani* has
a difference of a short time. He can become a *Jnani* again after staying in
*Mithyadarshan* for that much time. From the perspective of excellence, it is
infinite time (infinite *Utsarpini-Avasarpini* form), which is in the form of
*Deshon* *Aparthapudgalparavarta*. Because the *Samyagdristi*, falling from
*Samyaktva*, experiences *Mithyatva* for that much time and then surely attains
*Samyaktva* again.  While describing the difference of the *Agnani*, it is said
that the *Anadi-Aparyavasit* *Agnani* does not have a difference, because being
*Aparyavasit*, he does not abandon that state. The *Anadi-Saparyavasit* *Agnani*
also does not have a difference, because he does not go away upon attaining
*Kevalgyan*. The *Sadi-Saparyavasit* *Agnani* has a short difference of a short
time, because the time of short *Samyagdarshan* is only that much. From the
perspective of excellence, the difference is sixty-six *Sagaropama*, because
after falling from *Samyagdarshan*, he can remain an *Agnani* for that much
time.  The *Alpबहुत्व* Sutra is clear. The *Agnani* is infinite times more than
the *Jnani*. The *Agnani* *Vanaspatijiva* are infinite. Or, all beings have been
divided into two categories based on their use. There are two types of use:
*Sakar-Upayog* and *Anakar-Upayog*. Due to the duality of use, all beings are
also of two types: those with *Sakar-Upayog* and those with *Anakar-Upayog*. The
*Sanchittana* and difference of both of these, from both the perspective of
short and excellence, is a short time. Here, the commentator writes that because
the *Sattargati* is diverse, here, all beings should be taken as *Chhadmastha*
only, not *Kevali*. Because the *Sakar-Anakar* use of *Kevali* is simultaneous,
their *Kayasthiti* and *Antardwar* should also be said to be simultaneous, which
is not said. It is said to be "a short time", which happens in *Chhadmastha*. 1.
Two times *Vijayais* gone, three times *Achyue* heaven. _ In this way, human
beings, various beings, all. _ _ -Commentary.

[169. In the category of "Alpabahutva" (fewness), those with "Anaakar-upayog"
(non-form use) are the fewest, because the duration of "Anaakar-upayog" is
short, and they are obtained in small numbers at the time of inquiry. Those with
"Saakar-upayog" (form use) are countless times more numerous, because the
duration of "Saakar-upayog" is countless times longer than the duration of
"Anaakar-upayog". 234. Alternatively, all beings are classified into two types:

170 [Jivajivaabhigamsutra Gautam! The difference between the least and the
greatest duration of a *chhadmastha-paharak* is from a *kshullkabhav* (a very
short time) to an *asankhyeyakal* (an immeasurable time), which is like an
immeasurable part of an angul (finger) compared to the whole field. How long
does a *kevali-paharak* last? Gautam! From the least, it lasts until the end of
a *muhurt* (a period of time), and from the greatest, it lasts until the end of
a *deshon-purvakoti* (a very long time). Bhagavan! How long does an *anaaharak*
last? Gautam! There are two types of *anaaharaks* - *chhadmastha-anaaharaks* and
*kevali-anaaharaks*. Bhagavan! How long does a *chhadmastha-anaaharak* last?
Gautam! From the least, it lasts for one *samaya* (a period of time), and from
the greatest, it lasts for two *samayas*. Kevali-anaaharaks are of two types -
*siddhkevali-anaaharaks* and *bhavasthakevali-anaaharaks*. Bhagavan! How long
does a *siddhkevali-anaaharak* last? Gautam! It is *sadi-aparyavasit* (without
beginning or end). Bhagavan! How many types of *bhavasthakevali-anaaharaks* are
there? Gautam! There are two types - *sayogibhavasthakevali-anaaharaks* and
*ayogibhavasthakevali-anaaharaks*. Bhagavan! How long does a
*sayogibhavasthakevali-anaaharak* last? From the least, it lasts for three
*samayas* without any difference between the least and the greatest. An
*ayogibhavasthakevali-anaaharak* lasts from the least, until the end of a
*muhurt*, and from the greatest, it also lasts until the end of a *muhurt*.
Bhagavan! What is the difference between the least and the greatest duration of
a *chhadmastha-paharak*? Gautam! From the least, it lasts for one *samaya*, and
from the greatest, it lasts for two *samayas*. The difference between the least
and the greatest duration of a *kevali-graharak* is three *samayas* without any
difference between the least and the greatest. The difference between the least
and the greatest duration of an *anaaharak* is from two *samayas* less than a
*kshullkabhav* to an immeasurable time, which is like an immeasurable part of an
angul compared to the whole field. A *siddhkevali-anaaharak* is *sadi-
aparyavasit* (without beginning or end), so there is no difference. The
difference between the least and the greatest duration of a
*sayogibhavasthakevali-anaaharak* is the end of a *muhurt* from both the least
and the greatest. There is no difference between the least and the greatest
duration of an *ayogibhavasthakevali-anaaharak*. Bhagavan! Which of these
*aaharaks* and *anaaharaks* are less, more, equal, or superior to each other?
Gautam! The *anaaharaks* are the fewest, and the *aaharaks* are countless times
more than them. Discussion - This sutra, which deals with *aaharaks* and
*anaaharaks*, describes two types of all beings. Only *kevalis* who have
attained *vigraha-gati-samapanna* (complete liberation), *kevali-samudghat*
(complete knowledge), *ayogi-kevalis* and *siddh* are *anaaharaks*. All other
beings are *aaharaks*. 1. *Vigraha-imavanna kevalino samuhya ayogi ya / Siddha

##  All Living Beings' Approach to Food [171]  There are two types of living
beings who consume food: **Chhadmastha-Yahaarak** (pseudo-eaters) and **Kevali-
Grahaarak** (perfect eaters).  The lowest state of existence for a
**Chhadmastha-Yahaarak** is **two moments of Kshullakbhav-grahan** (consumption
of the subtle body). This is in comparison to the **Vigraha-Gati** (state of
disintegration) where the being is born in the **Kshullakbhav** (subtle body).
In states like **Lokanishkut** (a state of existence), there are four or five
moments of **Vigraha-Gati**, but most commonly, there are three moments. This is
what the sutra refers to. Other ancient teachers have also said the same. As
stated in the **Tattvarth Sutra**, "**Ek Dvau Va Anahaarakah**" (One or two are
non-eaters).  Out of the three moments of **Vigraha-Gati**, two moments are
**Anahaarak** (non-eating). Excluding those two moments, the being can remain a
**Yahaarak** (eater) in the lowest form until **Kshullakbhav**. In the highest
form, it can remain a **Yahaarak** for an **Asankhyeyakal** (incalculable time).
This **Asankhyeyakal** is a measure of **Asankhyey** (incalculable) **Utsarpini-
Avasarpini** (ascending-descending cycles) and is a fraction of **Kshetra-
Margna** (the measure of space). In other words, the number of **Utsarpini-
Avasarpini** cycles is equal to the number of **Akasha-Pradesh** (space regions)
in an **Angula-matra** (finger-width) multiplied by an **Asankhyey**
(incalculable) number.  A being can be born in the **A-Vigraha** (non-
disintegrated) form for such a long time, and in the **A-Vigraha** form, it is
constantly a **Yahaarak** (eater).  The lowest state of existence for a
**Kevali-Grahaarak** (perfect eater) is **Antarmuhurt** (a moment). This is in
comparison to the **Antarkrit-Kevali** (internal perfect being). In the highest
form, it is **Deshon-Purva-Koți** (a specific stage of spiritual development).
This is in comparison to the **Purva-Koți** (a specific stage of spiritual
development) where a being attains **Kevalgyan** (perfect knowledge) at the age
of nine years.  There are two types of **Anahaarak** (non-eaters):
**Chhadmastha-Anahaarak** (pseudo-non-eaters) and **Kevali-Anahaarak** (perfect
non-eaters).  A **Chhadmastha-Anahaarak** can remain a **Anahaarak** for a
minimum of one moment. This is in comparison to the **Vigraha-Gati** of two
moments. In the highest form, it can remain a **Anahaarak** for two moments.
This is in comparison to the **Vigraha-Gati** of three moments.  **Churnikaar**
(a commentator) has said that although the **Bhavagati** (the scriptures)
mentions **Anahaarak** for four moments, it is not accepted here because it is
**Kadaachit** (occasional). The majority view is given precedence. Therefore, a
**Chhadmastha-Anahaarak** can remain a **Anahaarak** for two moments.  There are
two types of **Kevali-Anahaarak** (perfect non-eaters): **Bhav-Stha-Kevali-
Anahaarak** (perfect non-eaters in the state of existence) and **Siddh-Kevali-
Anahaarak** (perfect non-eaters who have attained liberation).  **Siddh-Kevali-
Anahaarak** are **Sadi-A-Paryavasit** (beyond the cycle of birth and death).
Since **Siddh** (liberated beings) are **Sadi-A-Paryavasit**, their
**Anahaarak** (non-eating) is also **Sadi-A-Paryavasit**.  There are two types
of **Bhav-Stha-Kevali-Anahaarak** (perfect non-eaters in the state of
existence): **Sayogi-Bhav-Stha-Kevali-Anahaarak** (perfect non-eaters in the
state of existence with karmic attachments) and **A-Yogi-Bhav-Stha-Kevali-
Anahaarak** (perfect non-eaters in the state of existence without karmic
attachments).  An **A-Yogi-Bhav-Stha-Kevali-Anahaarak** can remain a
**Anahaarak** for a minimum of **Antarmuhurt** (a moment) and a maximum of
**Antarmuhurt** (a moment). **A-Yogitva** (lack of karmic attachments) occurs in
the **Shaileshi-Avastha** (a specific state of existence). In this state, the
being is naturally a **Anahaarak** (non-eater) because **Praudarik-Kay-Yog**
(karmic attachments related to the physical body) does not exist at that time.
The duration of the **Shaileshi-Avastha** is a minimum of **Antarmuhurt** (a
moment) and a maximum of **Antarmuhurt** (a moment). However, it is important to
understand that the **Utkrisht-Pad** (higher state) is more significant than the
**Jghanya-Pad** (lower state). Otherwise, there would be no need to mention both
states.  1. "**Ek Dvau Va Anahaarakah**" - **Tattvarth Sutra**, Chapter 2, Sutra
31 2. "Although the **Bhavagati** mentions **Anahaarak** for four moments, it is
not accepted here because it is **Kadaachit** (occasional). The majority view is
given precedence. Therefore, a **Chhadmastha-Anahaarak** can remain a
**Anahaarak** for two moments." - **Vriti** (commentary)

173. The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra states that a Sayogi-Bhav-Sthakevali who is an
Anaharaka can remain in the state of Jghana and Utkarhsa for three times without
any difference. This is because in the third, fourth, and fifth times of the
Asht-Samayik Kevali-Samudghat, only Karman-Kayayoga occurs. Therefore, in those
three times, he is an Anaharaka by rule. The difference between Antar-Dwar-
Chhadmasth-Anaharaka and Jghana is one time, and the difference between Antar-
Dwar-Chhadmasth-Anaharaka and Utkarhsa is two times. The duration of the
Chhadmasth-Anaharaka is the same as the duration of the Chhadmasth-Paharak. This
duration is one time from Jghana and two times from Utkarhsa. Therefore, the
difference between Chhadmasth-Paharak and Jghana is one time, and the difference
between Chhadmasth-Paharak and Utkarhsa is two times. The difference between
Kevali-Anaharaka and Ajghana-Utkarhsa is three times. Kevali-Anaharaka is a
Sayogi-Bhav-Sthakevali. His Anaharakatva is for three times, as mentioned
earlier. The difference between Kevali-Paharak and Kevali-Anaharaka is also
three times. The difference between Chhadmasth-Anaharaka and Jghana is two times
less than the Ksullak-Bhav, and the difference between Chhadmasth-Anaharaka and
Utkarhsa is countless times or countless parts of an Angul. This has been
explained earlier. The duration of the Chhadmasth-Paharak is the same as the
difference between Chhadmasth-Anaharaka and Jghana. There is no difference
between Siddha-Kevali-Anaharaka and Jghana because it is Sadi-A-Paryavasit. The
difference between Sayogi-Bhav-Sthakevali-Anaharaka and Jghana is Antar-Muhurt,
and the difference between Sayogi-Bhav-Sthakevali-Anaharaka and Utkarhsa is also
Antar-Muhurt. This is because after performing Kevali-Samudghat, the state of
Shaileshi is attained within Antar-Muhurt. Here also, one should understand that
the Utkarhsa-pad is more special than the Jghana-pad. There is no difference
between A-Yogi-Bhav-Sthakevali-Anaharaka and Jghana because all are Anaharaka in
the A-Yogi state. There is no difference between Siddhas and Jghana because they
are Sadi-A-Paryavasit. The least number of Anaharakas are those who are Siddhas,
Vigraha-Gati-Samapannak, Samudghat-Gat-Kevali, and A-Yogi-Kevali. The number of
Anaharakas is countless times less than the number of Aharakas. There might be a
doubt that the number of Vanaspati-Jivas is countless times more than the number
of Siddhas, and they are mostly Aharakas, so why is it not said that the number
of Aharakas is countless times more? The answer is that countless parts of the
Prati-Nigo-D are always in Vigraha-Gati every time, and Jivas are Anaharakas in
Vigraha-Gati. Therefore, the number of Aharakas is countless times more, not
countless times less. Here, information about Ksullak-Bhav is given in the
Vritti. It is being given here because it is useful. Ksullak-Bhav means small or
little. The reception of the smallest Bhav (the time of sensation of a small
lifespan) is Ksullak-Bhav-Grahan. According to the standards of Pravalikas, it
is two hundred and fifty-six Pravalikas. There are slightly more than seventeen
Ksullak-Bhav in one breath. There are sixty-five thousand five hundred Ksullak-
Bhav in one Muhurt.

## Translation:  **All living beings (Sarvajivas) are of 65,536 (65,536) types
of Kṣullakabhavas.**    **There are 3,773 breaths (Pānāprāṇa) in one Muhūrta.**
**By the rule of three, 17 Kṣullakabhavas are obtained in one breath.**
**Dividing 65,536 by 3,773, we get the number of Bhavas in one breath. The
quotient is 17 and the remainder is 1394, which has slightly more than 94
Pravalikās.**    **If we want to know the number of Pravalikās in one breath, we
should multiply 17 by 256 and add the above 94 Pravalikās, which gives us 4,446
Pravalikās.**    **If we want to know the number of Pravalikās in one Muhūrta,
we should multiply these 4,446 Pravalikās of one breath by the number of breaths
in one Muhūrta, which is 3,773, giving us 167,74,758 Pravalikās.**    **Adding
2,458 more Pravalikās to this, we get 167,77,216 Pravalikās in one Muhūrta.**
**Alternatively, we can multiply the 65,536 Kṣullakabhavas of a Muhūrta by the
256 Pravalikās of one Bhava to get the number of Pravalikās in one Muhūrta.**
**Therefore, it is appropriate to say that there are countless Pravalikās in one
breath.**    **235. Alternatively, all living beings are of two types: Sabhāṣaka
and Abhāṣaka.**    **O Bhagavan! How long does a Sabhāṣaka remain as a
Sabhāṣaka?**    **Gautama! From the lowest, one time, and from the highest, one
Antarmuhūrta.**    **1. Twenty-two thousand five hundred are sixty-six. These
are the Kṣullakabhavas in one Antarmuhūrta.**    **2. Three thousand seven
hundred seventy-three are the breaths. This is the Muhūrta, said by all the
omniscient ones.**    **3. One crore seventy-seven lakhs seventy-three thousand
two hundred sixteen are the Pravalikās in one Muhūrta.**    **O Bhagavan! What
about Abhāṣaka?**    **Gautama! Abhāṣaka is of two types: Sāīya and
Apajjavasīya.**    **O Bhagavan! How long is the difference between Sabhāṣaka
and Abhāṣaka?**    **Gautama! From the lowest, one time, and from the highest,
one Antarmuhūrta.**    **O Bhagavan! How long does a Sāīya Apajjavasīya Abhāṣaka
remain as an Abhāṣaka?**    **Gautama! From the lowest, one time, and from the
highest, one Antarmuhūrta.**    **O Bhagavan! How long does a Sāīya
Sapajjavasīya Abhāṣaka remain as an Abhāṣaka?**    **Gautama! From the lowest,
one time, and from the highest, an infinite time. The time of their birth and
death is infinite.**    **O Bhagavan! How long is the difference between
Sabhāṣaka and Abhāṣaka?**    **Gautama! From the lowest, one time, and from the
highest, an infinite time.**    **The difference between Sāīya Apajjavasīya and
Sāīya Sapajjavasīya is that the former remains as an Abhāṣaka for one time,
while the latter remains as an Abhāṣaka for an infinite time.**    **There are
many types of Sabhāṣaka and Abhāṣaka, and Abhāṣaka is infinite times more than
Sabhāṣaka.**    **Alternatively, all living beings are of two types: Sasarīrī
and Asarīrī.**    **Asarīrī are like Siddhas.**    **Sasarīrī are like
Asiddhas.**    **There are many types of Asarīrī and Sasarīrī, and Asarīrī is
infinite times more than Sasarīrī.**

174) [Jiva-jiva-abhigamsutra Bhanta! Prabhashaka, how long does a Prabhashaka
remain as a Prabhashaka? Gautama! Prabhashaka is of two types: Paryavasita and
Sadi-saparyavasita. / Of these, the Sadi-saparyavasita Prabhashaka remains as an
Abhashaka from the lowest, Antarmuhurta, to the highest, Anantakal, that is, for
the entire Ananta Utsarpini-Avasarpini kal, that is, for the entire
Vanaspatikal. / Bhagavan! What is the difference between a Bhaskha and a
Prabhashaka? Gautama! The difference between a Bhaskha and a Prabhashaka is from
the lowest, Antarmuhurta, to the highest, Anantakal, that is, Vanaspatikal. /
There is no difference for a Sadi-aparyavasita Prabhashaka. The difference for a
Sadi-saparyavasita Prabhashaka is one moment at the lowest and Antarmuhurta at
the highest. / There are very few Bhaskhas in the world, and Abhashakas are
infinitely more numerous. Or, all Jivas are of two types: Sasariri and Asariri.
Asariri should be considered like the Siddhas, with their Sanchiguna, and
Sasariri should be considered like the Prasiddhas. Asariri are few, and Sasariri
are infinitely more numerous.  /  Discussion: This Sutra speaks of two types of
Jivas in relation to Bhaskha and Prabhashaka. / The one who is speaking is a
Bhaskha, and the others are Prabhashakas. / A Bhaskha remains as a Bhaskha for
one moment at the lowest. This is because he dies at the time of grasping the
language-dravya, or for some other reason, he stops speaking. At the highest, he
remains as a Bhaskha for Antarmuhurta. For this long, he continuously grasps and

Prabhashaka remains as an Abhashaka for Vanaspatikal. This Vanaspatikal is the
entire Ananta Utsarpini-Avasarpini kal, and it is the time it takes to remove
the impurities from the infinite Lokakasha regions, one by one, by the power of
Kshetramargana. This time is equal to countless Pudgalparavata. / The size of

Prabhashaka can remain as an Abhashaka for this long in Vanaspati. / The

[All beings are accessible] [175 One should know the statement of the embodied
and disembodied as proven and well-known. 236. Or, all beings are of two types,
namely, charma and acharma / O Bhagavan! How long does charma remain in the
charma state? Gautama! Charma is anadi-saparyavasit. Acharma is of two types:
anadi-aparyavasit and sadi-aparyavasit / There is no difference between the two.
In terms of alpabahutva, acharma is the least, and charma is infinitely more
numerous than them. (This is the complete understanding of the two types of all
beings.) Discussion: The two types of all beings, charma and acharma, are
described in this sutra / The special bhavyas who will become siddhas are called
charma. Those who are opposite to them are called acharma. These acharma are
abhavyas and siddhas / In the kayasthiti sutra, charma is anadi-saparyavasit,
otherwise it cannot be called charma. In the acharma sutra, acharma is of two
types: anadi-aparyavasit and sadi-aparyavasit / Anadi-aparyavasit-acharma is the
abhavyas, and sadi-aparyavasit-acharma is the siddhas. There is no difference
between the two in the antaradwar. There is no difference between anadi-
saparyavasit-charma, because once charmatva is attained, it is not possible to
attain it again. Whether acharma is anadi-aparyavasit or sadi-aparyavasit, there
is no difference, because they do not attain charmatva. In the alpabahutva
sutra, acharma is the least, because only abhavyas and siddhas are acharma.
Charma is infinitely more numerous than them. This statement should be
understood in relation to the general bhava, otherwise it cannot be infinitely
more numerous / As the original commentator has said: "Charma is infinitely more
numerous / This should be understood in relation to the general bhavyas. The
subject division of the sutras is difficult to understand." Thus, the various
understandings regarding all beings are complete. The verse that summarizes the
two types of statements mentioned here is as follows: Siddhasaindiyakae joae
veae kasayalesa ya / Nanuvogaahara bhasasariri ya charamo ya / / Its meaning is
clear. 1. "Charma is infinitely more numerous, this should be understood in
relation to the general bhavyas. The subject division of the sutras is difficult
to understand."]

The difference between **Samyak** and **Mithyatva** दृष्टि is very subtle,
ranging from a mere moment to an eternity. This difference is expressed in terms
of **Deshon Aparadh Pudgal Paravart**.  There are very few **Samyak-Mithyatva**
दृष्टि, compared to **Samyak** दृष्टि, which are infinitely more numerous.
**Mithyatva** दृष्टि are infinitely more numerous than **Samyak** दृष्टि.  There
are three types of **Jivas**: **Samyak** दृष्टि, **Mithyatva** दृष्टि, and
**Samyak-Mithyatva** दृष्टि. Their nature has been explained earlier. Here, we
discuss their **Kayasthiti** (state of being), difference, and relative
abundance.  **Kayasthiti**: **Samyak** दृष्टि are of two types: **Sadi-
Aperyavasit** (**Kshayik Samyak** दृष्टि) and **Sadi-Sapyavasit** (**Kshayopa-
shaamik** etc. **Samyak** दृष्टि). The **Sadi-Sapyavasit** **Samyak** दृष्टि
have a **Kayasthiti** that lasts from a moment to a maximum of sixty-four
**Sagaropama** (a unit of time). This is because due to the varied **Karma**
results, a **Jiva** can fall into **Mithyatva** after this period. After this,
**Kshayopa-shaamik** **Samyak** दृष्टि does not persist.  **Mithyatva** दृष्टि
are of three types: **Anadi-Aperyavasit**, **Anadi-Sapyavasit**, and **Sadi-
Sapyavasit**. The **Sadi-Sapyavasit** **Mithyatva** दृष्टि lasts from a moment
to an eternity. After this period, a **Jiva** can attain **Samyak** दृष्टि
again. This eternity is **Anant Utsarpini-Avapini** in terms of **Kalmarg-na**
and **Deshon Aparadh Pudgal Paravart** in terms of **Kshetramarg-na**. This is
because a **Jiva** who has attained **Samyak** once, will inevitably attain it
again after this period. Due to the influence of previous **Samyak** दृष्टि,
they have renounced the world.  **Samyak-Mithyatva** दृष्टि lasts from a moment
to a moment, as this is the natural duration of **Mishradristi**. Only the
difference between the lowest and highest states is greater.  **Antar**
(difference): **Sadi-Aperyavasit** **Samyak** दृष्टि has no difference, as it is
**Aperyavasit**. The difference of **Sadi-Sapyavasit** **Samyak** दृष्टि is from
a moment to an eternity, as a **Jiva** can attain **Samyak** दृष्टि again within
a moment after falling from it.  **Anadi-Aperyavasit** **Mithyatva** दृष्टि has
no difference, as its **Mithyatva** never ends. **Anadi-Sapyavasit**
**Mithyatva** also has no difference, as it loses its **Anadi** nature when it
ends and begins again. The difference of **Sadi-Sapyavasit** **Mithyatva**
दृष्टि is from a moment to sixty-four **Sagaropama**, as the duration of
**Samyak** दृष्टि is usually the difference of **Mithyatva** दृष्टि. The lowest
and highest duration of **Samyak** दृष्टि is the same.  The difference of
**Samyak-Mithyatva** दृष्टि is a moment, as a **Jiva** can attain **Samyak-
Mithyatva** दृष्टि again within a moment after falling from it. The highest
difference is **Deshon Aparadh Pudgal Paravart**.

---------------------------
## All Beings (Sarva Jivaabhigam)  There are two types of worldly transmigration
(Samsara-Praparitta):  * **Anaadi-Aaparyavasit:** Without beginning and without
end. * **Anaadi-Saaparyavasit:** Without beginning but with an end.  There is
also **No-Paritta-No-Aparitta**, which is without beginning and without end.
**Kaaya-Paritta** (limited body) has a minimum duration of an **Antarmuhurta**
(a very short time) and a maximum duration of a **Vanaspatikala** (the lifespan
of a plant). **Samsara-Paritta** (limited worldly transmigration) has no
duration.  **Kaaya-Aparitta** (unlimited body) has a minimum duration of an
**Antarmuhurta** and a maximum duration of **Asankhyeya Kala** (an immeasurable
time, equivalent to the lifespan of the Earth).  **Anaadi-Aaparyavasit Samsara-
Paritta** has no duration.  **Anaadi-Saaparyavasit Samsara-Paritta** has no
duration.  **No-Paritta-No-Aparitta** also has no duration.  **Alp-Bahutva**
(the number of beings) is the least for **Paritta**, infinite for **No-Paritta-
No-Aparitta**, and infinite for **Aparitta**.  **Considering other aspects, all
worldly beings are of three types:**  * **Paritta:** Limited. * **Aparitta:**
Unlimited. * **No-Paritta-No-Aparitta:** Neither limited nor unlimited.
**Paritta** generally means limited. Beings who have limited their worldly
transmigration and their ordinary plant body are called **Paritta**.
**Aparitta** are the opposite, and **Siddha-Jiva** (liberated beings) are **No-
Paritta-No-Aparitta**.  This sutra discusses the **Kaaya-Sthiti** (body state),
**Antar** (duration), and **Alp-Bahutva** (number) of these three types of
beings.  **Kaaya-Sthiti** (body state) of **Paritta** is of two types:  *
**Kaaya-Paritta:** Each body. * **Samsara-Paritta:** Whose worldly
transmigration period is within the **Aapardha-Pudgala-Paravarta** (half the
time of the rotation of the universe).  **Paritta** can remain in **Kaaya-
Paritta** from a minimum of **Antarmuhurta** to a maximum of **Asankhyeya
Kala**. This **Asankhyeya Kala** is equivalent to the time taken for an
immeasurable number of **Utsapini-Avasapini** (ascending and descending) forms
to become **Nirlepa** (free from karmic matter) by removing one **Aakash-
Pradesha** (celestial region) from an immeasurable number of **Lokas** (worlds)
at each moment. Or, it can be said that it is equivalent to the time taken for
the **Sanchittana** (accumulation) of the **Prithvi-Kaya** (earth body) and all
other bodies. After this, they are born in an ordinary form according to the
law.  **Samsara-Paritta** can remain in the same form from a minimum of
**Antarmuhurta** to a maximum of **Ananta Kala** (infinite time). This **Ananta
Kala** is equivalent to the time taken for an infinite number of **Utsapini-
Avasapini** forms to become **Nirlepa** by removing **Aapardha-Pudgala-
Paravarta** from the universe. After this, they attain **Siddhi** (liberation)
according to the law. Otherwise, **Samsara-Paritta** has no meaning.
**Aparitta** are of two types:  * **Kaaya-Aparitta:** Ordinary plant beings. *
**Samsara-Aparitta:** **Krishnapakshika** (beings who are in the dark fortnight
of their life cycle).  **Kaaya-Aparitta** can remain in the same form from a
minimum of **Antarmuhurta** to a maximum of **Ananta Kala**. This **Ananta
Kala** is the lifespan of a plant, which has been explained earlier using
**Kala-Margna** (time path) and **Kshetra-Margna** (space path).  **Samsara-
Aparitta** are of two types:  * **Anaadi-Aaparyavasit:** Who will never attain
liberation. * **Anaadi-Saaparyavasit (Bhavya Vishesh):** Who will attain
liberation.

## Translation:  **10]** The **No-Uparyatta-No-Aparyatta** is a **Siddha**
(liberated) being. It is **Anadi-Aparyavasita** (beginningless and endless),
because there is no **Pratyapat** (rebirth) from it. The difference between
**Antardvara-Kaya-Uparyatta** and **Antardvara-Kaya-Aparyatta** is from
**Jghanya** (lowest) to **Antarmuhurta** (a very short time). In the case of
**Sadharana** (ordinary beings), it can remain for **Antarmuhurta** and then be
found again in every **Shariri** (body). From **Utkarsha** (highest), it should
be understood as **Vanaspatikaal** (the time of plants) for an infinite period.
It can remain in the **Sadharana** form for that long. There is no difference in
**Sansara-Uparyatta**. Because, after being freed from **Sansara-Uparyatta**,
there is no **Sansara-Uparyatta** again, and there is no **Pratyapat** of the
liberated being. The difference between **Kaya-Aparyatta** is from **Jghanya**
to **Antarmuhurta**. It is possible to find it in every **Shariri** for
**Antarmuhurta** and then again in **Kaya-Aparyatta**. From **Utkarsha**, there
is a difference of **Asankhyeya** (innumerable) time. This **Asankhyeya** time
is **Prithvi Kaal** (earth time). Its explanation has been done before in
**Kaalmarggana** and **Kshetramarggana**. The time of wandering in **Prithvi**
and other **Shariri** births is the same from **Utkarsha**.   Those who are
**Anadi-Aparyavasita** in **Sansara-Aparyatta** have no difference, because they
are **Aparyavasita**. And there is no difference in **Anadi-Saparyavasita**
either, because after leaving **Sansara-Aparyatta**, it is not possible to have
**Sansara-Aparyatta** again. There is also no difference in **No-Uparyatta-No-
Aparyatta**, because they are **Anadi-Aparyavasita**. **Alpबहुत्वद्वार** are the
smallest **Uparyatta**, because **Karma-Uparyatta** and **Sansara-Uparyatta**
beings are few. They are **Anantguna** (infinite times) more than **No-
Uparyatta-No-Aparyatta**, because **Siddha** beings are infinite. They are
**Anantguna** more than **Aparyatta**, because **Krishnapakshika** (dark side)
are **Atiprabhut** (very abundant).  **239.** Or, there are three types of
**Jiva** (soul): **Paryaptak** (sufficient), **Aparyaptak** (insufficient), and
**No-Uparyaptak-No-Aparyaptak**.   **Gautama!** How long does a **Paryaptak**
remain as a **Paryaptak**?   **Gautama!** It can remain from **Jghanya** to
**Antarmuhurta** and from **Utkarsha** to **Sadhika Sagaropama Shatapruthaktva**
(two hundred to nine hundred **Sagaropama**).  **Gautama!** How long can an
**Aparyaptak** remain as an **Aparyaptak**?   **Gautama!** It can remain from
**Jghanya** to **Antarmuhurta** and from **Utkarsha** to **Antarmuhurta**.
**Gautama!** **No-Uparyaptak-No-Aparyaptak** are **Aparyavasita** (endless).
**Gautama!** What is the difference between them?  **Gautama!** The difference
between **Paryaptak** is from **Jghanya** to **Antarmuhurta** and from
**Utkarsha** to **Antarmuhurta**. The difference between **Aparyaptak** is from
**Jghanya** to **Antarmuhurta** and from **Utkarsha** to **Sadhika Sagaropama
Shatapruthaktva**. This is the difference between them.  **Gautama!** **No-
Uparyaptak-No-Aparyaptak** are **Appabahu** (very few) everywhere,
**Aparyaptak** are **Anantguna** (infinite times) more, and **Paryaptak** are
**Sankhyajguna** (countable times) more.

---------------------------
All living beings are classified into three categories: **Paryāptaka**,
**Aparyāptaka**, and **Noparyāptaka-Noaparyāptaka**.    **Lord! What is the
duration of a Paryāptaka?**  **Gautama!** The duration of a Paryāptaka is from a
**jighnya antarmūhurta** to an **utkṛṣṭa antarmūhurta**. The duration of an
**Aparyāptaka** is from a **jighnya antarmūhurta** to an **utkṛṣṭa sādika
sāgaropam-śatapṛthaktva**. The duration of a **Noparyāptaka-Noaparyāptaka** is
**not defined**.  **There are very few Noparyāptaka-Noaparyāptaka, Aparyāptaka
are countless times more, and Paryāptaka are countless times more than
Aparyāptaka.**  **Explanation:**  The **kāya-sthiti** of a Paryāptaka is a
**jighnya antarmūhurta**. It is the time spent in the Paryāptaka state after
being born from an Aparyāptaka and before being reborn as an Aparyāptaka. The
**utkṛṣṭa kāya-sthiti** is from two hundred to nine hundred **sāgaropam** plus
some. After this, the birth in the **Aparyāptaka** form takes place according to
the rules. This statement is with respect to the **labdhi** (attainment).
Therefore, even if there is **upapāta Aparyāptakatva** (temporary
Aparyāptakatva) in the **apāntarāla** (intermediate period), there is no fault.
The **kāya-sthiti** of an **Aparyāptaka** is from a **jighnya antarmūhurta** to
an **utkṛṣṭa antarmūhurta** because the duration of **Aparyāptaka-labdhi**
(attainment of Aparyāptaka state) is only this much.  The **utkṛṣṭa** (highest)
state is greater than the **jighnya** (lowest) state. **Noparyāptaka-
Noaparyāptaka** are **siddh** (liberated) and **sādika-aparyavasita**
(unchanging). Therefore, they remain in the same form forever.  The duration of
a **Paryāptaka** is from a **jighnya antarmūhurta** to an **utkṛṣṭa
antarmūhurta** because the duration of **Aparyāptaka-kāla** (time spent as an
Aparyāptaka) is the duration of a **Paryāptaka**.  The duration of
**Aparyāptaka-kāla** is from a **jighnya antarmūhurta** to an **utkṛṣṭa
antarmūhurta**. The **jighnya antara** (lowest difference) of an **Aparyāptaka**
is an **antarmūhurta**, and the **utkṛṣṭa antara** (highest difference) is a
**sādika sāgaropam-śatapṛthaktva**.  The duration of a **Paryāptaka** is the
difference between **Aparyāptaka**, and the duration of a **Paryāptaka** is from
a **jighnya antarmūhurta** to an **utkṛṣṭa sādika sāgaropam-śatapṛthaktva**.
The difference between **Noparyāptaka-Noaparyāptaka** is **not defined** because
they are **siddh** (liberated) and **aparyavasita** (unchanging).  There are
very few **Noparyāptaka-Noaparyāptaka** because **siddh jīva** (liberated souls)
are fewer than other souls. **Aparyāptaka** are countless times more because
**nigoda jīva** (souls in the lower realms) always have countless
**Aparyāptaka**. **Paryāptaka** are countless times more than **Aparyāptaka**
because there are countless **Paryāptaka** in the **oha** (stream of existence)
of **sūkṣma** (subtle) beings.

[182] The lifespan of a Jiva (living being) with a subtle body (Sūkṣma) ranges
from a very short duration (Antarmūhurta) to an immeasurable period of time
(Asankhyeya Kāla), which is equivalent to the lifespan of the Earth. Similarly,
the lifespan of a Jiva with a gross body (Bādar) ranges from a very short
duration (Antarmūhurta) to an immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla).
This immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla) is equivalent to the duration
of countless cycles of ascending (Utsarpini) and descending (Avasarpini) time
periods (Kāla Mārgṇā). In terms of spatial measurement (Kṣetra Mārgṇā), it is
equivalent to an immeasurable fraction of an Angula (finger width). The lifespan
of a Jiva with neither a subtle nor a gross body (No Sūkṣma-No Bādar) is
infinite (Sādi-A Paryavasita). The difference between the lifespan of a Jiva
with a subtle body (Sūkṣma) and a Jiva with a gross body (Bādar) is a period of
time equivalent to the lifespan of a Jiva with a gross body (Bādar). Similarly,
the difference between the lifespan of a Jiva with a gross body (Bādar) and a
Jiva with a subtle body (Sūkṣma) is a period of time equivalent to the lifespan
of a Jiva with a subtle body (Sūkṣma). There is no difference in the lifespan of
a Jiva with neither a subtle nor a gross body (No Sūkṣma-No Bādar) because their
lifespan is infinite (A Paryavasita). The number of Jivas with neither a subtle
nor a gross body (No Sūkṣma-No Bādar) is the smallest, followed by Jivas with a
gross body (Bādar) which are infinitely more numerous, and finally Jivas with a
subtle body (Sūkṣma) which are immeasurably more numerous. Based on the nature
of their bodies (Kāya Sthiti), there are three types of Jivas: those with a
subtle body (Sūkṣma), those with a gross body (Bādar), and those with neither a
subtle nor a gross body (No Sūkṣma-No Bādar). This sūtra (aphorism) explains the
nature of their bodies (Kāya Sthiti), the difference in their lifespans
(Antara), and their relative abundance (Alp Bahutva). The lifespan of a Jiva
with a subtle body (Sūkṣma) ranges from a very short duration (Antarmūhurta) to
an immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla). After this immeasurable period
of time (Asankhyeya Kāla), they can be reborn as Jivas with a gross body
(Bādar). The lifespan of a Jiva with a gross body (Bādar) ranges from a very
short duration (Antarmūhurta) to an immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya
Kāla). After this immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla), they can be
reborn as Jivas with a subtle body (Sūkṣma). This immeasurable period of time
(Asankhyeya Kāla) is equivalent to the duration of countless cycles of ascending
(Utsarpini) and descending (Avasarpini) time periods (Kāla Mārgṇā). In terms of
spatial measurement (Kṣetra Mārgṇā), it is equivalent to the time it takes for
an immeasurable number of Lokākāśa (space) regions, each the size of an Angula
(finger width), to be completely emptied of all Jivas. This is known as the
lifespan of the Earth (Pṛthvī Kāla). The lifespan of a Jiva with a gross body
(Bādar) ranges from a very short duration (Antarmūhurta) to an immeasurable
period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla). After this immeasurable period of time
(Asankhyeya Kāla), they can be reborn as Jivas with a subtle body (Sūkṣma). This
immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla) is equivalent to the duration of
countless cycles of ascending (Utsarpini) and descending (Avasarpini) time
periods (Kāla Mārgṇā). In terms of spatial measurement (Kṣetra Mārgṇā), it is
equivalent to an immeasurable fraction of an Angula (finger width). After this
period of time, a worldly Jiva is regularly reborn as a Jiva with a subtle body
(Sūkṣma). Jivas with neither a subtle nor a gross body (No Sūkṣma-No Bādar) are
liberated souls (Siddh Jīva) and remain in their state forever (Sādi-A
Paryavasita). The difference in the lifespan of a Jiva with a subtle body
(Sūkṣma) ranges from a very short duration (Antarmūhurta) to an immeasurable
period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla). This immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya
Kāla) is equivalent to an immeasurable fraction of an Angula (finger width). The
difference in the lifespan of a Jiva with a gross body (Bādar) is the same. The
difference in the lifespan of a Jiva with a gross body (Bādar) ranges from a
very short duration (Antarmūhurta) to an immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya
Kāla). This immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla) is equivalent to an
immeasurable number of Lokas (worlds). There is no difference in the lifespan of
a Jiva with neither a subtle nor a gross body (No Sūkṣma-No Bādar) because their
lifespan is infinite (Sādi-A Paryavasita). Because their lifespan is infinite (A
Paryavasita), there is no difference in their lifespan. The number of Jivas with
neither a subtle nor a gross body (No Sūkṣma-No Bādar) is the smallest because
liberated souls (Siddh Jīva) are less numerous than other Jivas. Jivas with a
gross body (Bādar) are infinitely more numerous because Jivas with a gross body
(Bādar) are infinitely more numerous than liberated souls (Siddh Jīva). Jivas
with a subtle body (Sūkṣma) are immeasurably more numerous because Jivas with a
subtle body (Sūkṣma) are immeasurably more numerous than Jivas with a gross body
(Bādar). 241. There are three types of Jivas: those with a subtle body (Saṇṇī),
those with a gross body (Asaṇṇī), and those with neither a subtle nor a gross
body (No Saṇṇī-No Asaṇṇī). O Venerable One! How long is the lifespan of a Jiva
with a subtle body (Saṇṇī)? It ranges from a very short duration (Antarmūhurta

## 184] [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra 242. There are three types of Jivas: Bhava-
siddh, Abhava-siddh, and No-Bhava-siddh-No-Abhava-siddh. Bhava-siddh Jivas are
Anadi-Saparyavasit (beginningless and ending), Abhava-siddh Jivas are Anadi-
Aparyavasit (beginningless and unending), and No-Bhava-siddh-No-Abhava-siddh
Jivas are Sadi-Aparyavasit (beginning and unending). There is no difference
between these three. In terms of quantity, Abhava-siddh Jivas are the least, No-
Bhava-siddh-No-Abhava-siddh Jivas are infinitely more than them, and Bhava-siddh
Jivas are infinitely more than No-Bhava-siddh-No-Abhava-siddh Jivas. 242.
Alternatively, all Jivas are of three types: Bhava-siddh, Abhava-siddh, and No-
Bhava-siddh-No-Abhava-siddh. Bhava-siddh Jivas are Anadi-Saparyavasit
(beginningless and ending), Abhava-siddh Jivas are Anadi-Aparyavasit

Aparyavasit (beginning and unending). Therefore, there is no difference between
the three. In terms of quantity, Abhava-siddh Jivas are the least, No-Bhava-
siddh-No-Abhava-siddh Jivas are infinitely more than them, and Bhava-siddh Jivas
are infinitely more than No-Bhava-siddh-No-Abhava-siddh Jivas. This
classification of all Jivas is based on the concept of Bhavya (capable of
attaining liberation) and Abhavya (incapable of attaining liberation). Those who
are capable of attaining liberation are Bhavya, those who are incapable of
attaining liberation are Abhavya, and those who are free from the attributes of
Bhavya and Abhavya are Siddha Jivas, who are neither Bhavya nor Abhavya. Bhava-
siddh Jivas are Anadi-Saparyavasit (beginningless and ending), otherwise they
would not be Bhava-siddh. Abhava-siddh Jivas are Anadi-Aparyavasit
(beginningless and unending), otherwise they would not be Abhava-siddh. No-
Bhava-siddh-No-Abhava-siddh Jivas are Sadi-Aparyavasit (beginning and unending)
because Siddhas do not have any decline. Therefore, since they do not have a
duration, there is no question of their state of existence, and there is no
difference between these three. Because once a Jiva becomes Bhava-siddh, it is
impossible for it to become Bhava-siddh again. Similarly, there is no difference
in Abhava-siddh Jivas because they are Aparyavasit (unending) and never cease to
exist. Siddhas are also Sadi-Aparyavasit (beginning and unending) and therefore
there is no difference in them. In terms of quantity, Abhavya Jivas are the
least because they are equivalent to the Jghana Yuka-Anantaka (the lowest
category of Jivas). No-Bhava-siddh-No-Abhava-siddh Jivas are infinitely more
than them because Siddhas are infinitely more than Abhavya Jivas. Bhava-siddh
Jivas are infinitely more than No-Bhava-siddh-No-Abhava-siddh Jivas because
Bhavya Jivas are infinitely more than Siddhas. 243. Alternatively, all Jivas are

a Trasa Jiva remain as Trasa? Gautama! The minimum duration is Antarmukhurta (a
very short period of time), and the maximum duration is two Sagaro-Vamasahasra
(two thousand Sagaro-Vamas). The duration of Thavara Jivas is Vanasai-Kala (a
very long period of time). No-Trasa-No-Thavara Jivas are Sadi-Aparyavasit
(beginning and unending). There is a difference in the duration of Vanasai-Kala
for Thavara Jivas. There is a difference of two Sagaro-Vamasahasra (two thousand
Sagaro-Vamas) for Thavara Jivas. There is no difference in No-Trasa-No-Thavara
Jivas. In terms of quantity, Trasa Jivas are the least, No-Trasa-No-Thavara
Jivas are infinitely more than them, and Thavara Jivas are infinitely more than
No-Trasa-No-Thavara Jivas. This is the classification of all Jivas into three
types. 243. Alternatively, all Jivas are of three types: Trasa, Thavara, and No-

All beings can exist from [**Sarvajivaabhigam**] [155 and the best Saadhikas can
exist up to two thousand Sagaropama. Stationary beings, as stationary beings,
can exist until the end of the plant period. Notrasa-Nostaavara are Saadi-
Aaparyavasita. The difference between them is the plant period, and the
difference between stationary beings is two thousand Sagaropama. There is no
difference between Notrasa-Nostaavara. In terms of Alpabahutva, the fewest are
the S, from them Notrasa-Nostaavara (Siddha) are infinite times more, and from
them stationary beings are infinite times more. This is the complete diversity
of all beings. (This is not in the Sutra Vritti. After the Bhavasiddhikaadi
Sutra, it ends by saying "Se Tam Tiviha Savvajiva Pannatta").    **Four Types of
All Beings** 244. Those who say that all beings are of four types, according to
their statement, those four types are: Manoyogi, Vachanayogi, Kayayogi, and
Ayogi.    **How Long Do They Exist?**   O Bhagavan! How long does a Manoyogi
exist as a Manoyogi?   Gautama! A Manoyogi exists from the least amount of time,
one moment, to the most, Antarmuhurta.   The same is true for a Vachanayogi.   A
Kayayogi exists from the least amount of time, Antarmuhurta, to the most, the
plant period.   An Ayogi is Saadi-Aaparyavasita.   The difference between a
Manoyogi is from the least amount of time, Antarmuhurta, to the most, the plant
period.   The same is true for a Vachanayogi.   The difference between a
Kayayogi is from the least amount of time, one moment, to the most,
Antarmuhurta.   There is no difference for an Ayogi.    **How Many Are There?**
In terms of Alpabahutva, the fewest are Manoyogis, from them Vachanayogis are
countless times more, from them Ayogis are infinite times more, and from them
Kayayogis are infinite times more.    **Explanation**   In terms of Vivechana-
Yoga-Ayoga, here the four types of all beings are mentioned: Manoyogi,
Vachanayogi, Kayayogi, and Ayogi. The Sanchittana, Antar, and Alpabahutva of
these four are mentioned in this Sutra.    **Sanchittana**   A Manoyogi can
exist as a Manoyogi from the least amount of time, one moment. After that, in
the second moment, due to death or cessation of contemplation, one moment is
mentioned. As...

[186] The *jiva-jiva-abhigamsutra* is first spoken about the speaker. It should
be understood in relation to the specific *mano-yogya* *pudgala* reception. From
excellence to *antar-muhurta*, one can remain *mano-yogi*. Due to the nature of
the *jiva*, after this, he becomes *uparata* by rule. By *vacana-yogi*, here,
only *vaga-yogi* with two senses, etc., are meant. They can remain from the
lowest to one time and from excellence to *antar-muhurta*. This should also be
understood in relation to the specific *vag-dravya* reception. By *kaya-yogi*,
here, only *vaga-yogi* and *mano-yogi* with one sense, etc., are meant. They
remain in the same way from the lowest to *antar-muhurta*. From two senses,
etc., they can go to earth, etc., and remain for *antar-muhurta* and then return
to two senses. From excellence, one can remain in that form until the
*vanaspati-kala*. *A-yogi* are perfected. They are *sadi-aparyavasita*,
therefore, they always remain in the same form. The difference between *mano-
yogi* is the lowest *antar-muhurta*. After this, it is possible to receive
specific *mano-yogya* *pudgalas*. From excellence, it is *vanaspati-kala*. After
remaining in the *vanaspati* for that long, it is possible to return to the
*mano-yogi*. Similarly, one should know the lowest and highest difference of
*vaga-yogi*. The lowest difference of *kaya-yogi* is said to be one time and the
highest difference is *antar-muhurta*. This statement is said in relation to
*audarik-kaya-yoga*. Because in the *apantarala-gati* of two times, there is a
difference of one time. From excellence, the difference is said to be *antar-
muhurta*. This statement is in relation to the completion of the *paripurna-
audarik-sharira-paryapti*. There, taking the time of *vigraha*, there is a
difference of *antar-muhurta* until the completion of *audarik-sharira-
paryapti*. Therefore, from excellence, the difference is said to be *antar-
muhurta*. The *vrittikara* has quoted the statement of the *churnikara* in
support of this statement. The *vrittikara* has also said that these *sutras*
are difficult to understand because they are spoken with a different meaning,
therefore, they should be understood from the *samyak-sampradaya*. That *samyak-
sampradaya* is in this form, therefore, it is reasonable. One should not create
the appearance of inconsistency without understanding the meaning of the
*sutras*. One should only strive to make the *sutras* consistent. *Alpa-bahutva-
dvara* are the fewest *mano-yogi*, because *deva*, *naraka*, *garbha-ja*
*tiryak* *panchendriya* and *manushya* are the only *mano-yogi*. From them,
*vacana-yogi* are countless times more, because *dvi-indriya*, *tri-indriya*,
*chatur-indriya*, *asangya* *panchendriya* are *vaga-yogi*. From them, *a-yogi*
are infinite times more, because *siddha* are infinite. From them, *kaya-yogi*
are infinite times more, because *vanaspati* *jiva* are infinite times more than
*siddha*. 245. *Ahva chaumviha savvajiva pannta, tam jaha–ithiveyaga

## 18.]  A being with an age of a *purvakoti* (a very long time) may be born as
a human or a female animal for five or six existences. Then, it may be born as
an *aparigeehita* (unmarried) goddess in the *Ishaan* heaven with an age of
fifty *palyopama* (a unit of time). From there, it may be born again as a human
or a female animal with an age of *purvakoti* and then be born again as an
*aparigeehita* goddess in the *Ishaan* heaven with an age of fifty *palyopama*.
In this way, the being can remain in the female form for a total of 110
*palyopama* beyond the *purvakoti* duration.  From another perspective, the
*kayasthiti* (state of existence) of a female being with an age of one hundred
*palyopama* beyond the *purvakoti* duration occurs as follows: A female being
with an age of *purvakoti* may be born as a human or a female animal for five or
six existences. Then, it may be born as an *aparigeehita* goddess in the
*Soudharma* heaven with an age of fifty *palyopama* and an excellent state. From
there, it may be born again as a human or a female animal and then be born again
as an *aparigeehita* goddess in the *Soudharma* heaven with an age of fifty
*palyopama*. In this way, the *kayasthiti* of a female being with an age of one
hundred *palyopama* beyond the *purvakoti* duration occurs.  From a third
perspective, a female being with specific qualities may be born as a
*parigeehita* (married) goddess in the *Ishaan* heaven with an excellent state
and remain there for nine *palyopama*. Then, it may be born as a human or a
female animal and then be born again as a *parigeehita* goddess in the *Ishaan*
heaven with an excellent state for nine *palyopama*. In this way, the
*kayasthiti* of a female being with an age of eighteen *palyopama* beyond the
*purvakoti* duration occurs.  From a fourth perspective, a female being with the
aforementioned qualities may be born as a *parigeehita* goddess in the
*Soudharma* heaven with an excellent state for seven *palyopama*. Then, it may
be born as a human or a female animal and then be born again as a *parigeehita*
goddess in the *Soudharma* heaven with an excellent state for seven *palyopama*.
In this way, the *kayasthiti* of a female being with an age of fourteen
*palyopama* beyond the *purvakoti* duration occurs.  From a fifth perspective,
the *kayasthiti* of a female being with an age of one *palyopama* beyond the
*purvakoti* duration occurs as follows: A being with an age of *purvakoti* may
be born as a human or a female animal for seven existences. Then, it may be born
as a female being in the *Devakuru* heaven with an age of three *palyopama* and
then be born as a goddess in the *Soudharma* heaven with a low state. In this
way, the *kayasthiti* of a being with an age of one *palyopama* beyond the
*purvakoti* duration occurs.  The *kayasthiti* of a male being is from the
lowest *antarmuhoorta* (a very short time) to the highest *saadhik sagaropama
shata* (a very long time). The lowest *kayasthiti* occurs when a being leaves
the *striveed* (female) or *napusaka* (neuter) state and enters the *purusha*
(male) state for a *antarmuhoorta* and then returns to the *striveed* state. The
highest *kayasthiti* occurs when a being travels through the heavens, humans,
and animals for a *saadhik sagaropama shata*. After this long period, the
*purusha* state transforms.  Here, a doubt may arise: Just as the lowest
*kayasthiti* of the *striveed* and *napusaka* states is said to be for a single
time (referring to the experience of the *striveed* or *napusaka* state for a
single time after the *vedopashmana* (cessation of karma) in the *upashma*
category), why is the *purusha* state not said to have a lowest *kayasthiti* for
a single time?  The solution is that a being who dies in the *upashma* category
is born in the *purusha* state.

190. The Jiva-Jiva-Migam Sutra states that the Kevala-darshani is Sadi-A-
paryavasit. The difference between the Chakshu-darshani is from Anto-muhurt to
Vanaspati-kala. There is no difference between the two types of A-chakshu-
darshani. The difference between the Avadhi-darshani is from Anto-muhurt to
Vanaspati-kala. There is no difference between the Kevala-darshani. The Avadhi-
darshani are the least in number, the Chakshu-darshani are countless times more,
the Kevala-darshani are infinite times more, and the A-chakshu-darshani are also
infinite times more. 246. Alternatively, all Jivas are of four types: Chakshu-
darshani, A-chakshu-darshani, Avadhi-darshani, and Kevala-darshani. Bhagavan!
How long can a Chakshu-darshani remain a Chakshu-darshani? Gautama! From the
lowest Anto-muhurt to the highest, it can remain for a thousand Sagaropama.
There are two types of A-chakshu-darshani: Anadi-A-paryavasit and Anadi-Sa-
paryavasit. The Avadhi-darshani can remain for a minimum of one time and a
maximum of 66 Sagaropama. The Kevala-darshani is Sadi-A-paryavasit. The
difference between the Chakshu-darshani is from Anto-muhurt to Vanaspati-kala.
There is no difference between the two types of A-chakshu-darshani. The
difference between the Avadhi-darshani is from Anto-muhurt to Vanaspati-kala.
There is no difference between the Kevala-darshani. The Avadhi-darshani are the
least in number, the Chakshu-darshani are countless times more, the Kevala-
darshani are infinite times more, and the A-chakshu-darshani are also infinite
times more. This Sutra explains the four types of Jivas, their Kayasthiti,
difference, and relative number. Kayasthiti: The Chakshu-darshani can remain in
the Chakshu-darshani form for a minimum of Anto-muhurt. It can leave the
A-chakshu-darshani state and enter the Chakshu-darshani state for a period of
Anto-muhurt and then return to the A-chakshu-darshani state. It can remain in
the Chakshu-darshani state for a maximum of a thousand Sagaropama. There are two
types of A-chakshu-darshani: Anadi-A-paryavasit, who will never attain Siddhi,
and Anadi-Sa-paryavasit, the Bhavy Jivas who will attain Siddhi. The Anadi and
A-paryavasit have no time limit. The Avadhi-darshani remains in that form for a
minimum of one time. After attaining Avadhi-darshan, one may die within that
time or lose Avadhi due to Mithyatva or bad intentions. It can remain in the
Avadhi-darshani state for a maximum of 66 Sagaropama. The logic is as follows:

[A being with knowledge of disintegration] [191 If a being with knowledge of
disintegration is born in the seventh earth below humans/ he remains there for
thirty-three sagaropama/ when the time of upward movement is near, he attains
samyaktva and leaves it again and is born in a tiryanch with the same age as
before, with knowledge of disintegration/ from there he is again born in the
seventh earth below, with disintegration, and remains there for thirty-three
sagaropama/ during the time of upward movement, he attains samyaktva for a short
time and leaves it again and is born in a tiryanch with the same age as before,
with disintegration. In this way, being born twice in the seventh earth and
twice in a tiryanch, there are 66 sagaropama in total/ since disintegration is
prohibited in vigraha, it should be said that he is born in the form of
avigraha.'] The statement that samyaktva occurs for a short time in between is
because the knowledge of disintegration can only flourish for thirty-three
sagaropama, the previous age, and beyond. Therefore, it is said that samyaktva
occurs for a short time in between. In this way, after staying for 66
sagaropama, the being with knowledge of disintegration attains humanhood in the
state of apatit vibhang, and by practicing restraint with samyaktva, he is born
twice in the vijayadi vimanas, then he remains an avadhidarshi for another 66
sagaropama/ avadhidarshan is equal to avadhigyan and vibhanggyan. From this
perspective, an avadhidarshi can remain in that form for two sixty-six
sagaropama. A kevaladarshi is sadi-aparyavasit, so there is no time limit. The
difference between antaradwar-chakshudarshi and antarmuhurt is negligible. After
such a time, there can be a disruption of acchkshudarshan and then it can become
chakshudarshi again/ the difference in excellence is vanaspatikala/ there is no
difference in anadi-aparyavasit acchkshudarshan/ there is also no difference in
anadi-saparyavasit. Once acchkshudarshanitva is gone, it does not happen again;
for those whose karmas have been destroyed, there is no repetition. The
negligible difference for an avadhidarshi is one time. After repetition, its
benefit can be obtained only after a long time. In some places, the reading is
antarmuhurt/ after such a disruption, it can be obtained again/ that reading is
not baseless, because the original commentator has also mentioned it as a
different opinion/ the difference in excellence for an avadhidarshi is
vanaspatikala. After such a disruption, avadhidarshan definitely happens again/
there is no contradiction in anadi mithyadristi also happening/ knowledge
happens only with samyaktva, but darshan does not necessarily happen with
samyaktva. Since a kevaladarshi is sadi-aparyavasit, there is no difference.
Alpabahutvadwar-avadhidarshi are the fewest, because it happens only to gods,
narakas, and some garbhaja tiryanch panchendriya and humans. Chakshudarshi are
countless times more than them, because it happens to all tiryanch panchendriya
and chaturindriya. Kevaladarshi are infinite times more than them, because
siddhas are infinite/ acchkshudarshi are infinite times more than them, because
even ekendriya have acchkshudarshan. 1. Vibhangnani panchendriya tirikhhajonia
manuya ya paharagaa, no anaharagaa. 2. "Vibhangnani jahannean ekkan samayan,
ukkosenan teettisan sagarovamai desunaae punchakodie abbahiain tti".

[All living beings] [193 will take restraint and will attain perfection from the
same attained restraint. The unrestrained one who is sadi-saparyavasit is the
one who is corrupted by sarvavirati or deshavirati. There is no time limit for
the sadi-saparyavasit unrestrained one because of being anadi and praparyavasit.
The sadi-saparyavasit unrestrained one remains from the lowest to the
antarmuhurta / after this, one can again become restrained / from the highest to
the infinite time, which is the infinite utsarpini-avsarpinī form (from
kalamargana) and the deshon aparthapudgalparavarta form from kshetramargana. The
kayasthiti of the restrained-unrestrained one is from the lowest to the
antarmuhurta. The attainment of restrained-unrestrainedness happens from many
bhangas, yet it is from the lowest to the antarmuhurta! From the highest to the

deshon purvakoti. The interruption form of unrestrainedness, the restrained time
and the restrained-unrestrained time, is the same from the highest / the
difference of the restrained-unrestrained one is from the lowest to the

this much time / from the highest, one should say like the restrained one / the
unrestrained-unrestrained-unrestrained-restrained ones are siddhas. Because they
are sadi-aparyavasit, there is no difference / because they are aparyavasit,
they always remain in that form.    The alpabahutvadwar - the fewest restrained
ones, because they are countless koti-koti in number. The restrained-
unrestrained ones are countless times more than them, because countless ones are
deshavirati tiryanch. The siddhas who are tri-taya-pratisedha form are countless
times more than them, and the unrestrained ones are countless times more than
them, because the plants are countless times more than the siddhas. All living
beings - five types - statement 248. Those who said this way, the five types of
all living beings, they said this way, as follows - kohakasai, manakasai,
mayakasai, lobhakasai, akasai.   Kohakasai, manakasai, mayakasai, from the
lowest to the antarmuhurta, from the highest to the antarmuhurta / lobhakasai,
from the lowest to one time, from the highest to the antarmuhurta / akasai, two

lobhakasai, from the lowest to the antarmuhurta, from the highest to the

## Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra 248:  Those who say there are five types of all
beings, according to them, these five distinctions are as follows: Krodhakṣayī,
Mānakṣayī, Māyakṣayī, Lobhakṣayī, and Akṣayī.  Krodhakṣayī, Mānakṣayī, and
Māyakṣayī remain in that form from the lowest to the Antarmuhūrta and from the
highest to the Antarmuhūrta. Lobhakṣayī can remain in that form from the lowest
to one time and from the highest to the Antarmuhūrta.  Akṣayī are of two types
(as said before): Sādi-Aparyavasin and Sādi-Sapyavasit. Sādi-Sapyavasit can
remain in that form from the lowest to one time and from the highest to the
Antarmuhūrta.  The difference between Krodhakṣayī, Mānakṣayī, and Māyakṣayī is
from the lowest to one time and from the highest to the Antarmuhūrta. The
difference between Lobhakṣayī is from the lowest to the Antarmuhūrta and from
the highest to the Antarmuhūrta. Regarding Akṣayī, understand as said before.
In terms of Alpabahutva, Akṣayī are the fewest, Mānakṣayī are infinitely more
than them, and Krodhakṣayī, Māyakṣayī, and Lobhakṣayī should be known as
progressively more numerous.  From the perspective of Vivecana-Kṣaya-Akṣaya, the
five types of all beings are as follows: Krodhakṣayī, Mānakṣayī, Māyakṣayī,
Lobhakṣayī, and Akṣayī. Their Kayasthiti, Antar, and Alpabahutva are as follows:
**Kayasthiti:** The Kayasthiti of Krodhakṣayī, Mānakṣayī, and Māyakṣayī is from
the lowest to the Antarmuhūrta and from the highest to the Antarmuhūrta. Because
it is said that the usage time of Krodha etc. is Antarmuhūrta. Lobhakṣayī
remains in that form from the lowest to one time. This statement is based on the
expectation that death occurs after the first time of the rise of Lobhakṣaya
when falling from the Upaśamaśreṇī. It is possible for someone to experience
Krodha etc. at the time of death. Falling in order happens in the state of
Mṛtyābhāva, not in death. The Kayasthiti from the highest is Antarmuhūrta.
**Akṣayī** are of two types: Sādi-Aparyavasin (Kevali) and Sādi-Sapyavasit
(Upaśāntakṣayī). The Kayasthiti of Sādi-Sapyavasit Akṣayī is from the lowest to
one time. Death in the second time can lead to the attainment of Sakṣayattva due
to the rise of Krodha etc. From the highest, it is Antarmuhūrta, because the
time of Upaśāntamohguṇasthāna is the same.  Other Ācāryas say that it should be
called Antarmuhūrta even from the lowest, because it is an old tradition that
death does not occur before the Antarmuhūrta for Lobhopaśama. This statement
seems to be in line with the intention of the Sūtrakāra, because he later
mentions the Kayasthiti of Lobhakṣayī as from the lowest and from the highest to
the Antarmuhūrta.  **Antar:** The Antar of Krodhakṣayī is from the lowest to one
time, because death after the Upaśamasamaya can lead to its rise again. From the
highest, it is Antarmuhūrta. Similarly, the Antar of Mānakṣayī and Māyakṣayī
should be said. The Antar of Lobhakṣayī is from the lowest to the Antarmuhūrta
and from the highest to the Antarmuhūrta, only the difference between the lowest
and the highest is greater.  1.  **Krodhāyupayogakālo Antarmuhūrta mitivacanāt**
(Because it is said that the usage time of Krodha is Antarmuhūrta).

the country, half-pudgala-paravarta. In this much time, the attainment of the
previously experienced Akashayitva is obtained by rule. Alpabahutva-dwar - the
fewest Akashayi, because only Siddhas are Akashayi. From them, the Manakashayi
are infinite times more, because the Nigoda-Jivas are infinite times more than
the Siddhas. From them, the Krodhakashayi are more special, because the rise of
Krodhakashaya is long-lasting, from them the Mayakashayi are more special, and
from them the Lobhakashayi are more special, because the rise of Maya and Lobha
is very long-lasting. 249. Or all beings are of five types - Nairyaik,

## Translation:  **[All Beings Access]** [197] In the context of "least to
most", the six categories of all beings are described as follows, considering
the least to most number of senses, starting with the five-sensed beings, then
the four-sensed, then the three-sensed, then the two-sensed, then the infinite-
virtue beings without senses, and finally the infinite-knowledge beings with one
sense. These categories are: 1. **Aabhinibodhik Jnanee** (Mati Jnanee), 2.
**Shruta Jnanee**, 3. **Avadhi Jnanee**, 4. **Manah Paryaya Jnanee**, 5. **Keval
Jnanee**, 6. **Ajnanee**.  The duration, interval, and "least to most" aspects
of these categories are described in this sutra.   **Duration (Kayasthiti):**  *
**Aabhinibodhik Jnanee:** The duration of this state can be from the least,
which is an **Antarmuhurt** (a very short period of time), to the maximum, which
is **Saadhik Chhiyaasath Sagaropama** (a period of time equivalent to 64
oceans). This should be understood as a period of time that is twice the
duration of the **Vijay** (a specific period of time). * **Shruta Jnanee:** The
duration of this state is the same as the **Aabhinibodhik Jnanee**, because both
**Aabhinibodhik Jnan** and **Shruta Jnan** are inseparable. It is said that
where **Aabhinibodhik Jnan** exists, **Shruta Jnan** also exists, and vice
versa. These two are mutually dependent. * **Avadhi Jnanee:** The duration of
this state is from the least, which is **Ek Samaya** (one moment), to the
maximum, which is **Saadhik Chhiyaasath Sagaropama**, similar to the **Mati
Jnanee**. This **Ek Samaya** should be understood as the time between the
attainment of **Avadhi Jnan** and death or the time between the attainment of
**Avadhi Jnan** and falling into **Mithyatva** (falsehood) due to **Pratipat**
(a specific type of mental state). * **Manah Paryaya Jnanee:** The duration of
this state is from the least, which is **Ek Samaya**, because death can occur in
the second moment, leading to **Pratipat**. The maximum duration is **Deshon
Purvakoti** (a specific period of time), because the duration of **Charitrakal**
(a specific period of time) is the same as the maximum duration. * **Keval
Jnanee:** The duration of this state is **Sadi-Aperyavasit** (infinite and
without beginning). Therefore, this state never ends. * **Ajnanee:** There are
three types of **Ajnanee**: **Anadi-Aperyavasit** (without beginning and without
end), **Anadi-Sapyavasit** (without beginning but with an end), and **Sadi-
Sapyavasit** (with a beginning and with an end). The duration of the **Sadi-
Sapyavasit Ajnanee** is from the least, which is **Antarmuhurt**, because after
this period, they can attain **Samyaktva** (right knowledge) and become a
**Jnanee** again. The maximum duration is **Anantkal** (infinite time), which is
**Deshon Aparthpudgalparavart** (a specific period of time), because after
losing **Jnanitva** (knowledge), they will definitely become a **Jnanee** again
after this period of time.  **Interval (Antar):**  * **Aabhinibodhik Jnanee:**
The least interval is **Antarmuhurt**. After this period, they can become an
**Aabhinibodhik Jnanee** again. The maximum interval is **Deshon
Aparthpudgalparavart**. * **Shruta Jnanee, Avadhi Jnanee, Manah Paryaya
Jnanee:** The interval for these categories should be understood in the same way
as the **Aabhinibodhik Jnanee**. * **Keval Jnanee:** There is no interval for
this category because it is **Sadi-Aperyavasit**. * **Anadi-Aperyavasit Ajnanee,
Anadi-Sapyavasit Ajnanee:** There is no interval for these categories because
they are **Aperyavasit** (without end) and **Anadi** (without beginning). *
**Sadi-Sapyavasit Ajnanee:** The least interval is **Antarmuhurt**, because
after this period, they can become an **Ajnanee** again from a **Jnanee**. The
maximum interval is **Saadhik Chhiyaasath Sagaropama**.  **Note:** 1. "Jatth
Aabhinibodhiyanaan, Tatth Suyanaan, Jatth Suyanaan, Tatth Aabhinibodhiyanaan,
Dovi Eyaai Annopan Manugayaai" - This quote explains the inseparable nature of
**Aabhinibodhik Jnan** and **Shruta Jnan**.

## 198] [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra _ Alp-Bahutva-Dwar]  The Manah-Paryaya-Jnani are
the fewest, because Manah-Paryaya-Jnana is only attained by those with specific
character. The Avadhi-Jnani are countless times more numerous, because even
Devas and Narakas possess Avadhi-Jnana. The Abhinibodhik-Jnani and Shruta-Jnani
are both privileged and equal in their own place. The Kevala-Jnani are
infinitely more numerous, because the Siddha Kevala-Jnani are infinite. The
Agnani are infinitely more numerous, because the Agnani Vanaspatikayik Jivas are
infinitely more numerous than the Siddhas.   Or, considering the Indriya and
Anindriya, all Jivas are said to be of six types: Eka-Indriya, up to Pancha-
Indriya, and Anindriya. The Anindriya are Siddhas. Their Kay-Sthiti, Antar, and
Alp-Bahutva have been explained earlier.   251. Or, all Jivas are classified
into six types: Audarik-Shariri, Vaikriya-Shariri, Aharak-Shariri, Tejas-
Shariri, Karman-Shariri, and Ashariri.   Bhagavan! How long can an Audarik-
Shariri remain?   Gautam! From the lowest, two moments less than the Ksullak-
Bhav-Grahan, and from the highest, for an Asankhyeya-Kal. This Asankhyeya-Kal is
equal to the time taken to exhaust the space of an Asankhyeya-th part of an
Angul.   The Vaikriya-Shariri can remain from the lowest, an Antar-Muhurta, and
from the highest, for thirty-three Sagaropama more than an Antar-Muhurta.   The
Aharak-Shariri can remain from the lowest, an Antar-Muhurta, and from the
highest, only for an Antar-Muhurta.   The Tejas-Shariri are of two types: Anadi-
Aparyavasit and Anadi-Saparyavasit.   Similarly, the Karman-Shariri are also of
two types.   The Ashariri are Sadi-Aparyavasit.   1. 'Tam Sanjayasya Savva-

## Translation:  **[All Living Beings]**  **[199]** The difference in the
duration of an **Audārika** body is a minimum of one **samaya** and a maximum of
thirty-three **sāgaropamas** more than an **antarmuhūrta**. The difference in
the duration of a **Vaikriya** body is a minimum of an **antarmuhūrta** and a
maximum of an **anantakāla**, which is equivalent to the duration of a
**vanaspatikāla**. The difference in the duration of an **Āhārak** body is a
minimum of an **antarmuhūrta** and a maximum of an **anantakāla**, which is the
form of **deśona** **apārddha** **pudgala** **parāvṛtta**. There is no
difference in the duration of a **Tejas-Kārmaṇa** body.  **_In terms of
quantity, the Āhārak** body is the least, the Vaikriya body is countless times
more than that, the Audārika body is countless times more than that, the
**Aśarīrī** is countless times more than that, the **Tejas-Kārmaṇa** body is
countless times more than that, and they are both equal in their own place.
Thus, the understanding of the six types of all living beings is complete.
**_The discussion of the body and the non-body reveals that all living beings
are of six types: Audārika, Vaikriya, Āhārak, Tejas, Kārmaṇa, and Aśarīrī. Their
state of existence, difference, and quantity are as follows:_**  **_State of
Existence:_** The **Audārika** body can exist in its form continuously from the
minimum of two **samayas** less than the **kṣullakbhava** to the maximum of an
**asanख्येयकाल**. In the **vigraha** state, it is said to be two **samayas**
less because it is a **Kārmaṇa** body in the first two **samayas**. It can exist
for an **asanख्येयकाल**. Production is possible without **vigraha** for this
duration. This **asanख्येयकाल** is equal to the time it takes to remove
countless parts of an **angula** from countless **ākāśa** regions, one at a
time, until they are completely devoid of matter. The **Vaikriya** body exists
in its form from a minimum of one **samaya**. Death is possible only after an
**anantakāla** of **vikūrvaṇā**. It exists from a maximum of an **antarmuhūrta**
to thirty-three **sāgaropamas** more. **_One should understand this in relation
to a virtuous **saṃyati** who, by taking on a **Vaikriya** body, lives for an
**antarmuhūrta** and is born in the **anuttaravimānas** through **avigraha** due
to the destruction of the state of existence._** The **Āhārak** body can exist
in its form from a minimum of an **antarmuhūrta** to a maximum of an
**antarmuhūrta**. The **Tejas** and **Kārmaṇa** bodies are of two types:
**anādi-aparyavasita** (never liberated) and **anādi-saparyavasita**
(liberated). Both of these are **anādi** and **aparyavasita**, so they are
without a time limit. The **Aśarīrī** is **sādi-aparyavasita**. Therefore, it
always remains in its form.  **_Difference:_** The difference in the
**Audārika** body is one **samaya** from the minimum. It exists in a **vigraha**
state of two **samayas**, because it is a **Kārmaṇa** body in the first
**samaya**. The difference from the maximum is an **antarmuhūrta** plus thirty-
three **sāgaropamas**. This is the maximum **Vaikriya** time. The difference in
the **Vaikriya** body is a minimum of an **antarmuhūrta**. After becoming
**Vaikriya** once, it can become **Vaikriya** again after this much
interruption. This happens in humans and gods. The difference from the maximum
is clearly a **vanaspatikāla**. The minimum difference in the **Āhārak** body is
an **antarmuhūrta**. After becoming **Āhārak** once, it can become **Āhārak**
again after this much interruption. The difference from the maximum is an
**anantakāla**, which is the form of **deśona** **apārddha** **pudgala**
**parāvṛtta**. There is no difference in the **Tejas-Kārmaṇa** body.

[200] [Jivaji Dabhigam Sutra] _ The Alpabahutva (few in number) are the
Aharaksharir (those who have a body that consumes food), because they are at
most two thousand to nine thousand. The Vaikriyasarir (those who have a body
that is not made of matter) are countless times more than them, because Devas
(gods), Narakas (hells), Garbhaja (embryos), Tiryanch (animals), Panchendriya
(five senses), Manushya (humans), and Vayukaya (air body) are all Vaikriyasarir.
The Audarikasharir (those who have a body that is made of matter and is not
limited to a single form) are countless times more than them. / In Nigodas
(groups of souls), there are countless souls in a single Audarikasharir, so it
is countless times more, not infinitely more. / As the original commentator
said, "The Asharir (those who have no body) are infinitely more than the
Audarikasharir, because the Siddhas (liberated souls) are infinite, and the
Audarikasharir are countless times more than the body." The Asharir are
infinitely more than the Audarikasharir, because the Siddhas are infinite. The
Tejas-Karmanasharir (those who have a body that is made of Tejas (light) and
Karma (action)) are infinitely more than them, because in Nigodas, the Tejas-
Karmanasharir is different for each soul, and they are infinite. / Tejas and
Karmanasharir are inseparable and equal to each other. Thus, the understanding
of the six types of Sarvajiva (all beings) is complete. Sarvajiva - Seven Types

say that all beings are of seven types, they state it as follows: Prithvikaayik
(earth body), Apkaayik (water body), Tejaskaayik (light body), Vayukaayik (air
body), Vanaspatikaayik (plant body), Traskaayik (fire body), and Prakaayik
(ether body). / Their Sanchitthana (accumulation) and differences have been
mentioned before. Alpabahutva is as follows: The Traskaayik are the fewest, the
Tejaskaayik are countless times more than them, the Prithvikaayik are more than
them, the Apkaayik are more than them, the Vayukaayik are more than them, the
Prakaayik are infinitely more than them, and the Vanaspatikaayik are infinitely
more than them. / Their explanation has been given before. 253. Ahva Sataviha

All beings are classified into seven types: Krishna-leshya, Nila-leshya, Kapota-
leshya, Tejo-leshya, Padma-leshya, Shukla-leshya, and Aleshya.  **भगवन् !

remain in the Krishna-leshya state?** **Gautam! It can remain for a period
ranging from a minimum of Antarmuhurta to a maximum of thirty-three Sagaropama,
exceeding the Antarmuhurta by the amount of Antarmuhurta.**  **Lord! How long
can a Nila-leshya being remain in that state?** **Gautam! It can remain for a
period ranging from a minimum of Antarmuhurta to a maximum of ten Sagaropama,
exceeding the Antarmuhurta by an immeasurable portion of Palyopama.**  **A
Kapota-leshya being remains for a period ranging from a minimum of Antarmuhurta
to a maximum of three Sagaropama, exceeding the Antarmuhurta by an immeasurable
portion of Palyopama. A Tejo-leshya being can remain for a period ranging from a
minimum of Antarmuhurta to a maximum of three Sagaropama, exceeding the
Antarmuhurta by an immeasurable portion of Palyopama. A Padma-leshya being
remains for a period ranging from a minimum of Antarmuhurta to a maximum of ten
Sagaropama, exceeding the Antarmuhurta by an immeasurable portion of Palyopama.
A Shukla-leshya being can remain for a period ranging from a minimum of
Antarmuhurta to a maximum of thirty-three Sagaropama, exceeding the Antarmuhurta
by the amount of Antarmuhurta. Aleshya beings are Sadi-Apayavasi, therefore they
always remain in the same state.**  **Lord! What is the difference between
Krishna-leshya beings?** **Gautam! The difference between Krishna-leshya beings
is from a minimum of Antarmuhurta to a maximum of thirty-three Sagaropama,
exceeding the Antarmuhurta by the amount of Antarmuhurta. Similarly, you should
know the difference between Nila-leshya and Kapota-leshya beings. The difference
between Tejo-leshya beings is from a minimum of Antarmuhurta to a maximum of the
duration of a plant's life, exceeding the Antarmuhurta by the amount of
Antarmuhurta. Similarly, the difference between Padma-leshya and Shukla-leshya
beings is the same. Lord! What is the difference between Aleshya beings?**
**Gautam! Since Aleshya beings are Sadi-Apayavasi, there is no difference
between them.**  **Lord! Among these Krishna-leshya, Nila-leshya, and so on, up
to Shukla-leshya and Aleshya beings, who is inferior, superior, equal, or
special?**  **Gautam! Shukla-leshya beings are Samvatho, Padma-leshya beings are
Sankhyejjana, Tejo-leshya beings are Sankhyejguna, Aleshya beings are
Pranantaguna, Kapota-leshya beings are Anantaguna, Nila-leshya beings are
Vishesahiya, and Krishna-leshya beings are Vishesahiya. Thus, all beings are
classified into these seven types.**

## Jīvālivābhigamasūtra - Gautama!  **The Seven Types of Souls:**  *
**Śuklaleśyā:** The least numerous, followed by... * **Padmaleśyā:** Numerically
greater than Śuklaleśyā. * **Tejoleśyā:** Numerically greater than Padmaleśyā. *
**Bhaleśyā:** Infinitely numerous. * **Kāpotaleśyā:** Infinitely numerous,
greater than Bhaleśyā. * **Nīlaleśyā:** Infinitely numerous, greater than
Kāpotaleśyā. * **Nīlaleśyā Viśeṣādhika:** Greater than Nīlaleśyā. * **Kṛṣṇaleśyā
Viśeṣādhika:** Greater than Nīlaleśyā Viśeṣādhika.  This sūtra describes seven
types of souls, six with leśyā and one without (aleśyā).  **Explanation of their
Kāyasthiti (Body-State), Antar (Interval), and Alpबहुत्व (Numerical
Abundance):**  **Kāyasthiti:**  * **Kṛṣṇaleśyā:** The lowest kāyasthiti is an
antarmuhūrta (a period of 48 minutes). This is because in the case of humans and
animals, Kṛṣṇaleśyā lasts for an antarmuhūrta. The highest kāyasthiti is 33
sāgaropamas (a period of 100,000 years). This is because the highest kāyasthiti
of Kṛṣṇaleśyā is found in the devās (gods) and nārkas (hell beings) who are in
the state of paścātyabhava (past life) and agretnabhava (future life). The
nārkas of the Adhasaptamapṛthvī (the seventh earth from the top) are Kṛṣṇaleśyā
and have a kāyasthiti of 33 sāgaropamas. Their paścātyabhava is an antarmuhūrta
and their agretnabhava is one antarmuhūrta, making a total of two antarmuhūrtas.
However, due to the countless divisions within an antarmuhūrta, they are all
included within a single antarmuhūrta. Therefore, the highest kāyasthiti of
Kṛṣṇaleśyā is 33 sāgaropamas. * **Nīlaleśyā:** The lowest kāyasthiti is one
antarmuhūrta. The reasoning is the same as for Kṛṣṇaleśyā. The highest
kāyasthiti is 10 sāgaropamas, which is an innumerable part of a palyopamas (a
period of 100,000 years). This is because the nārkas of the first stone of the
Dhūmaprabhāpṛthvī (the earth of smoke and light) are Nīlaleśyā and have this
kāyasthiti. Their paścātyabhava and agretnabhava are included within the
innumerable parts of a palyopamas, so they are not mentioned separately. *
**Kāpotaleśyā:** The lowest kāyasthiti is one antarmuhūrta. The reasoning is the
same as for Kṛṣṇaleśyā. The highest kāyasthiti is 3 sāgaropamas, which is an
innumerable part of a palyopamas. This is because the nārkas of the first stone
of the Bālukaprabhā (the earth of sand and light) are Kāpotaleśyā and have this
kāyasthiti. * **Tejoleśyā:** The lowest kāyasthiti is one antarmuhūrta. The
reasoning is the same as for Kṛṣṇaleśyā. The highest kāyasthiti is 2
sāgaropamas, which is an innumerable part of a palyopamas. This is because the
Iśānadevas (gods of the north) are Tejoleśyā. * **Padmaleśyā:** The lowest
kāyasthiti is one antarmuhūrta. The reasoning is the same as for Kṛṣṇaleśyā. The
highest kāyasthiti is 10 sāgaropamas. This is because the Brahmalokadevas (gods
of the Brahma world) are Padmaleśyā. * **Śuklaleśyā:** The lowest kāyasthiti is
one antarmuhūrta. The reasoning is the same as for Kṛṣṇaleśyā. The highest
kāyasthiti is 33 sāgaropamas. This is because the Anuttaradevas (gods of the
highest world) are Śuklaleśyā.  **Antar:**  * **Kṛṣṇaleśyā:** The lowest antar
is one antarmuhūrta, because the leśyā of humans and animals changes within an
antarmuhūrta. The highest antar is 33 sāgaropamas, because the highest duration
of Śuklaleśyā is the highest duration of the antar of Kṛṣṇaleśyā. * **Nīlaleśyā
and Kāpotaleśyā:** The lowest and highest antar should be understood in the same
way as for Kṛṣṇaleśyā. * **Tejoleśyā, Padmaleśyā, and Śuklaleśyā:** The lowest
antar is one antarmuhūrta and the highest antar is a vanaspatikāla (a period of
100 years). * **Aleśyā:** There is no antar for Aleśyā because they are without
leśyā.

## Sajiwaabhigam [203]  **Alpabahutyadwar** - Those with the least amount of
**Shuklaleshya** are few in number, because **Lantk** etc. gods, a sufficient
number of **garbhja** (born from womb) **panchendriya** (five-sensed)
**tiryanch** (animals) and humans have **Shuklaleshya**.   **Padmaleshya** are
countless times more than those with **Shuklaleshya**, because **Sanatkumar**,
**Mahendra** and **Brahmalok** gods, and a vast number of **garbhja**
**tiryanch** and humans have **Padmaleshya**.   **Doubt:** If **Sanatkumar**
etc. gods of the three kalpas are countless times more than **Lantk** etc. gods,
then those with **Padmaleshya** should be countless times more than those with
**Shuklaleshya**. Why are they said to be countless times more?  **Solution:**
Even in the **Javanayapad** (world of birth), there are countless times more
**panchendriya** **tiryanch** with **Shuklaleshya** than **Sanatkumar** etc.
gods of the three kalpas. Therefore, those with **Padmaleshya** are only
countless times more than those with **Shuklaleshya**.  **Tejoleshya** are
countless times more than those with **Padmaleshya**, because there are
countless times more **tiryanch** with five senses, humans, **bhavanpati**
(lords of the house) **vyantar jyotishk** (celestial bodies) and gods of
**Soudharma** and **Ishana** devlokas (heavenly realms) who have **Tejoleshya**.
**Aleshya** are infinite times more than those with **Tejoleshya**, because
**Siddhas** (liberated souls) are infinite.  **Kapoteleshya** are infinite times
more than those with **Aleshya**, because there are infinite times more
**vanaspatikayik** (plant-bodied beings) with **Kapoteleshya** than **Siddhas**.
**Neelaleshya** are many times more than those with **Kapoteleshya**.
**Krishnaaleshya** are many times more than those with **Neelaleshya**, because
there are many with **klishta** (difficult) **adhayavasaya** (determination).
This completes the seven types of **sarvajiva** (all beings) **pratipatti**
(attainment).  **Sarvajiva** - **Ashtavidha** (eight types) - **Vaktvyata**

## 204] [The Sutra on the Approach of Souls (Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra) states that
there are two types of souls, with countless differences, infinite qualities,
and infinite differences in their duration. / 254. Those who say that there are
eight types of all beings mean that all beings are of eight types,
differentiated by their knowledge: Abhinibodhik-Jnani, Shruta-Jnani, Avadhi-
Jnani, Manah-Paryaya-Jnani, Kevala-Jnani, Mati-Ajnani, Shruta-Ajnani, and
Vibhang-Jnani.  O Bhagavan! For how long does an Abhinibodhik-Jnani remain as an
Abhinibodhik-Jnani? Gautam! From the least, an Antarmuhurta, to the most, sixty-
four Sagaropama. A Shruta-Jnani also remains for the same duration. An Avadhi-
Jnani remains from the least, one time, to the most, sixty-four Sagaropama. / A
Manah-Paryaya-Jnani remains from the least, one time, to the most, Deshona
Purva-Koti. A Kevala-Jnani, being Sadi-A-Paryavasit, remains forever in that
form. Mati-Ajnanis are of three types: 1. Anadi-A-Paryavasit, 2. Anadi-Sa-
Paryavasit, and 3. Sadi-Sa-Paryavasit. / Of these, the Sadi-Sa-Paryavasit
remains from the least, Antarmuhurta, to the most, infinite time, which is
Deshona A-Pardha-Pudgala-Paravarta form. / A Shruta-Ajnani also remains for the
same duration. A Vibhang-Jnani remains from the least, one time, to the most,
Deshona Purva-Koti plus thirty-three Sagaropama. / The difference in an
Abhinibodhik-Jnani is from the least, Antarmuhurta, to the most, infinite time,
which is Deshona Pudgala-Paravarta form. Similarly, one should know the
difference in a Shruta-Jnani, Avadhi-Jnani, and Manah-Paryaya-Jnani. There is no
difference in a Kevala-Jnani, because he is Sadi-A-Paryavasit. Among Mati-
Ajnanis, there is no difference in those who are Anadi-A-Paryavasit. There is no
difference in those who are Anadi-Sa-Paryavasit. There is a difference in those
who are Sadi-Sa-Paryavasit, from the least, Antarmuhurta, to the most, sixty-
four Sagaropama. Similarly, one should know the difference in a Shruta-Ajnani. /
The difference in a Vibhang-Jnani is from the least, Antarmuhurta, to the most,
Vanaspatikala. O Bhagavan! Among these Abhinibodhik-Jnani, Shruta-Jnani, Avadhi-
Jnani, Manah-Paryaya-Jnani, Kevala-Jnani, Mati-Ajnani, Shruta-Ajnani, and
Vibhang-Jnani, who is less, more, equal, or superior to whom? Gautam! The least
are Manah-Paryaya-Jnani. Avadhi-Jnani are countless times more than them. Mati-
Jnani and Shruta-Jnani are superior and equal in their own place. Vibhang-Jnani
are countless times more than them. Kevala-Jnani are infinite times more than
them. Mati-Ajnani and Shruta-Ajnani are infinite times more than them and equal
in their own place. / Discussion - This has been discussed in the sixth chapter
of the treatise on all beings. Therefore, the inquisitive can see it there. 255.
Or, if you wish to know the duration of the different types of beings, then know
this: There are Nirjaria, Tiryak-Joni, Manushya, Deva, and Siddha. O Bhagavan!
For how long does a Nirjaria remain? Gautam! From the least, a thousand years of
dwelling, to the most, thirty-three Sagaropama. O Bhagavan! For how long does a
Tiryak-Joni remain? From the least, Antarmuhurta, to the most, Vanaspatikala.

**All Beings** (205th Kalpa. Tirthankara: "O Venerable Gautama! How long does a

stays for ten thousand years and the highest for thirty-three **Sagaropama**."
Tirthankara: "O Venerable! How long does a **Tiryancha** stay in the

Gautama: "O Venerable! The lowest stays for an **Antarmuhurta** and the highest

should know about the **Manushya** and **Manushi** as well. Tirthankara: "O
Venerable! How long does a **Deva** stay in the **Deva** state?" Gautama: "O
Venerable! The lowest stays for ten thousand years and the highest for fifty-
five **Palyapama**." Tirthankara: "O Venerable! How long does a **Siddha** stay
in the **Siddha** state?" Gautama: "O Venerable! The **Siddha** is **Sadi-
Apayavasita** and stays in that state forever." Tirthankara: "O Venerable! What
is the difference between a **Nairyika** and a **Nairyika**?" Gautama: "O

Venerable! Among these **Nairyika**, **Tiryancha**, **Tiryanchika**,
**Manushya**, **Manushi**, **Deva**, **Devi**, and **Siddha**, who is less,
more, equal, or superior?" Gautama: "O Venerable! The **Manushi** are the least,

countless times more than them, the **Tiryanchika** are countless times more
than them, the **Deva** are countless times more than them, the **Devi** are

them, and the **Tiryancha** are infinite times more than them." Discussion: The
discussion of this should be seen in the sixth **Pratipatti** called

the Vanaspatikaal. Bhagavan! How long can a two-sensed being live as a two-

four-sensed beings. Bhagavan! How long does a five-sensed being live as a five-

From the least, an antarmukhurta, and from the most, the Vanaspatikaal.
Similarly, one should know the difference of the Apkayika, Tejaskaika, and
Vayukaika. The difference of the Vanaspatikaika is the same as the duration of
the Earth-bodied beings, that is, from the least, an antarmukhurta, and from the
most, an innumerable time. Similarly, the difference of these four, the two-
sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed, is from the least, an
antarmukhurta, and from the most, the Vanaspatikaal. Since the insensed is Sadi-
Aperyavasit, it has no difference. Bhagavan! Among these Earth-bodied, Apkayika,
Tejaskaika, Vayukaika, Vanaspatikaika, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed,
five-sensed, and insensed, who is less, more, equal, or superior to whom?
Gautama! The five-sensed are the least, the four-sensed are superior to them,
the three-sensed are superior to them, the two-sensed are superior to them, the
Tejaskaika are innumerable times more, the Earth-bodied are superior to them,
the Apkayika are superior to them, the Vayukaika are superior to them, the
insensed are infinite times more, and the Vanaspatikaika are infinite times
more. The discussion of the logic and feeling of all these has been said in the
previous places. Therefore, it is not being repeated. The inquisitive people
should see it in its place. 259. Ahva Dasviha Savvajiva Pannaatta, Tam Jaha-1.

##  Anadhyayakala [Quoted from Nandī Sūtra edited by Ācārya Pravartarī Śrī
Prātmārāmji Mahārāja]  One should study the scriptures only during the time
prescribed for study in the Pāgamas. Studying during Anadhyayakala is
prohibited. The Manusmṛti and other Smṛtis also describe Anadhyayakala in
detail. Vedic people also mention the Anadhyayas of the Vedas. Similarly, other
Ārya scriptures are also considered Anadhyaya. Since the Jain Āgamas are also
considered to be Sarvajñokta, Devādhiṣṭhita, and Svaravidyā, their Anadhyayakala
is also described in the Āgamas. For example, the ten types of Anadhyayas
related to the sky are:   1. Ukkāvāte (meteor shower) 2. Disidādhē (fire in the
sky) 3. Gajjite (thunder) 4. Nigghāte (lightning) 5. Juvate (wind) 6.
Jakkhālitte (earthquake) 7. Dhūmita (smoke) 8. Mahita (fog) 9. Rayugghaate
(rain) 10.  The end of the day.  The ten types of Anadhyayas related to the body
are:  1. Aṭṭhī (bones) 2. Maṁsaṁ (flesh) 3. Soṇitte (blood) 4. Asūtisāmante
(death) 5. Susāṇasāmante (cremation) 6. Candovārāte (moonlight) 7. Sūrovārāte
(sunlight) 8. Paḍanē (falling) 9. Rāyavugghē (illness) 10. The end of the body.
- **Stāhnāṅga Sūtra, Stāna 10**  A Niggantha or a Nigganthī should not study
during the four Mahāpāḍivayas:  1. Āsāḍhapāḍivaya 2. Indamahāpāḍivaya 3.
Kattipāḍivaya 4. Sugimhapāḍivaya  - **Stāhnāṅga Sūtra, Stāna 4, Uddesa 2**  A
Niggantha or a Nigganthī should not study during the four Saṁjhās:  1. Paḍimāte
(morning) 2. Pacchimāte (afternoon) 3. Majjhaṇhē (noon) 4. Aḍḍharatte (midnight)
- **Stāhnāṅga Sūtra, Stāna 4, Uddesa 2**  A Niggantha or a Nigganthī can study
during the four Kālas:  1. Puvvaṇhē (early morning) 2. Avaraṇhē (evening) 3.
Papprosē (sunrise) 4. Pacchūsē (sunset)  - **Stāhnāṅga Sūtra, Stāna 4, Uddesa
2**  According to the above Sūtrapāṭha, there are thirty-two Anadhyayas: ten
related to the sky, ten related to the body, four Mahāpāḍivayas, four
Mahāpāḍivaya Pūrṇimās, and four Saṁjhās. These are briefly described below:
**Ten Anadhyayas related to the sky:**  1. **Ukkāpāta-Tārāpatan:** If there is a
major starfall, one should not study for one Prahara. 2. **Digdāha:** One should
not study as long as the direction is red, meaning it appears as if there is
fire in the direction.

[Chapter on Unfavorable Time for Study] 3-4. Thunder and lightning are generally
caused by the nature of the season. Therefore, the period from Ardra to Swati
Nakshatra is not considered unfavorable for study. 5. If there is a loud
thunderclap in the sky without clouds, or if there is thunderclap with clouds,
then there is an unfavorable time for study for two Praharas. 6. In the Shukla
Paksha of the month of Yupa, the combination of the evening glow and the
moonlight on the first, second, and third days is called Yupa. During these
days, one should not study from Prahara to night. 7. Yakshadeepta - Sometimes, a
light appears in a direction, like lightning, but with a slight delay. This is
called Yakshadeepta. Therefore, one should not study as long as the Yaksha-like
light is visible in the sky. 8. Dhumika Krishna - The period from Kartik to Magh
is the gestation period of clouds. During this time, a fine, water-like mist of
smoky color falls. This is called Dhumika Krishna. One should not study as long
as this mist falls. 9. Mihika Shweta - In winter, a fine, water-like mist of
white color is called Mihika. One should not study as long as this falls. 10.
Raj Udghāt - Due to wind, dust spreads all over the sky. One should not study as
long as this dust remains spread. The above ten reasons are related to the sky
and are unfavorable for study. Ten unfavorable reasons related to the material
world are as follows: 11-12-13. Bones, flesh, and blood - If the bones, flesh,
and blood of a five-sensed animal are visible, then there is an unfavorable time
for study until these things are removed from there. The commentator considers
the presence of these things within 60 hands to be unfavorable. Similarly, the
presence of bones, flesh, and blood of a human being is also considered
unfavorable. The difference is that the unfavorable time for these is up to 100
hands and for one day and night. The unfavorable time for a woman's menstrual
period is three days. The unfavorable time for the birth of a boy and a girl is
considered to be seven and eight days respectively. 14. Impurity - There is an
unfavorable time for study until the excrement and urine are visible. 15.
Cremation ground - The area around the cremation ground up to 100 hands on all
sides is considered unfavorable for study. 16. Lunar eclipse - During a lunar
eclipse, one should not study for eight Praharas for the lowest category, twelve
Praharas for the middle category, and sixteen Praharas for the highest category.
17. Solar eclipse - During a solar eclipse, the unfavorable time for study is
considered to be eight, twelve, and sixteen Praharas respectively.

## Chapter 18:   **18. Anadhyayakala:**  When a great king or a national leader
passes away, one should not perform *svadhyaya* until their cremation is
completed. Alternatively, one should gradually resume *svadhyaya* only after a
new authority takes over.  **19. Rajavyudgraha:** When neighboring kings are
engaged in war, one should not perform *svadhyaya* for a day and night even
after peace is restored.  **20. Audarik Sharira:** When a five-sense being dies
within the confines of an *upaashraya*, one should not perform *svadhyaya* as
long as the body remains there. Similarly, if the lifeless body lies within a
radius of 100 hands, *svadhyaya* should be avoided. These ten reasons for
avoiding *svadhyaya* are related to the *audarik sharira*.  **21-28. Four
Mahotsav and Four Mahapratipada:** The four *mahotsav* are Ashadh Purnima, Paush
Purnima, Kartik Purnima, and Chaitra Purnima. The *pratipada* following these
*purnimas* are called *mahapratipada*. *Svadhyaya* is prohibited during these
days.  **29-32. Pratah, Sayam, Madhyahna, and Ardharatri:** One should not
perform *svadhyaya* one *ghadi* before and one *ghadi* after sunrise, one
*ghadi* before and one *ghadi* after sunset, one *ghadi* before and one *ghadi*
after midday, and one *ghadi* before and one *ghadi* after midnight.
