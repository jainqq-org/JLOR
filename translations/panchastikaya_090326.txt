## Statement  About six hundred years after the attainment of omniscience by
Lord Vardhaman Veer Bhagwan, a severe famine struck the Magadh vihar. To escape
the crisis, the great ascetic Nirmath Sadhu migrated to the south, where he was
able to uphold his twenty-eight fundamental virtues flawlessly according to the
teachings of Veer Vaani. Those who remained in Magadh could not withstand the
terrible famine and became entangled in worldly affairs. They abandoned the
teachings of Lord Mahavira, giving up Digambarism (wearing clothes) and making
changes to the Vitarag Jinvaani under the influence of passions. They distorted
the scriptures.  During this time, Acharya Kundkund Dev emerged. Through his
knowledge and penance, he studied the original teachings of Lord Mahavira and
spread Digambar Jainism from the south. He composed many texts in the Prakrit
language, which was prevalent at that time, in accordance with the divine voice
of Lord Mahavira.  To enable the devotees to achieve their welfare and become
the Supreme Soul by embracing Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct,
he primarily composed three texts: Samayapramrit, Panchastikaya Sangrah
(Prabhrit), and Pravachansar. He also composed other supporting Prabhrit texts
(like Moksha Pahud - Moksha Prabhrit).  To understand the principles described
by the omniscient, passionless one, is Right Faith. If someone acquires
knowledge of the Jinendra Vaani but does not have faith in it, then no action
will bear fruit. This is why even those who recite the eleven Angas and nine
Purvas remain trapped in the cycle of birth and death, while those who have even
a little faith in the knowledge of the Tush-Masha (a tiny seed) are liberated
from the world. Therefore, the attainment of Right Faith, which is the form of
faith in the knowledge of the principles, is given the utmost importance.  It is
also essential to know the principles taught by the omniscient Lord, because how
can one have faith without knowing the principles? Having faith in the wrong
things taught by ignorant and passionate individuals does not benefit the soul.
In this Panchastikaya Prabhrit, Acharya Kundkund Dev has described in detail the
seven principles, nine substances, six dravyas, five astikayas, and the time
dravya, as taught by the omniscient, passionless Lord.  To make this text
accessible to all and to ensure that the meaning of the Acharya's words is
understood correctly, two Sanskrit commentaries and their Hindi translations
have been included in this edition.  Brahmachari Shrilal Jain Kavya Tirth

**Verse 2:** May the Jain doctrine, whose life is Syatkara, be victorious, as it
is the medicine that destroys the insurmountable opposition of the group of
Nayas.  **Verse 3:** Now, from here, the explanation of time (Samaya Vyakhya),
which is the mother of pure light, the form of right knowledge, is briefly
explained, relying on two Nayas.  **Verse 4:** Here, the first Sutra-maker has
presented the basic substances in the form of Pancha-Astikaya and six types of
Dravyas.  **Verse 5:** Afterwards (in the second chapter), the arrangement of
the nine substances, which are the synonyms of Jiva and Ajiva, whose paths
(actions) are of different types, has been explained.  **Verse 6:** Afterwards
(at the end of the second chapter), the attainment of the highest liberation,
which is the form of welfare, has been explained through the three-fold path
(path of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct), after knowing the
truth (Pancha-Astikaya, six Dravyas, and nine substances).

## The Commentary on the Panchaastikaya, by Shri Jayasenacharya  **Salutation:**
To the Supreme Soul, the Jina, who is self-realized, To the pure soul, the
eternal bliss, I bow. ||1||  **Introduction:**  This commentary on the
Panchaastikaya, composed by Shri Kundakundaacharya, is presented in a clear and
concise manner, following the established tradition of the disciples of Shri
Kumaranandi Siddhanta Deva.   The author, after attaining liberation and
witnessing the divine form of the omniscient, non-attached, and liberated
Tirthankara, Shri Mandar Swami, received the essence of the pure soul and other
truths from the divine words emanating from his lotus mouth. He then returned to
this world and composed this commentary, the Panchaastikaya Praabhrut, for the
benefit of his disciples, like Shivakumar Maharaj, who were eager to understand
the essence of the teachings.   This commentary aims to explain the inner and
outer aspects of the Panchaastikaya, as well as the primary and secondary
meanings, in accordance with the Padmananyaaya.  **Structure of the
Commentary:**  The Panchaastikaya Praabhrut is divided into three main sections
(Mahaadhikars):  1. **First Mahaadhikars:** This section, comprising 111 verses,
deals with the six substances (Dravyas) of the Panchaastikaya, starting with the
verse "Indasayavdiyaanam". This section can also be considered to extend to 114
verses, as per the interpretation of the Amritachandra Tika.  2. **Second
Mahaadhikars:** This section, comprising 50 verses, explains the seven
categories of non-substance (Tannananavapadarthas), starting with the verse
"Abhivandiun Siraasa". This section can also be considered to extend to 84
verses, as per the interpretation of the Amritachandra Tika.  3. **Third
Mahaadhikars:** This section, comprising 20 verses, focuses on the path to
liberation and the nature of liberation, starting with the verse
"Jeevasvabhavo".  Therefore, the entire commentary consists of 181 verses,
divided into three main sections.  **Sub-sections within the Mahaadhikars:**
Within each Mahaadhikars, there are further sub-sections (Antaraadhikars):  *
**First Mahaadhikars:** This section is further divided into eight sub-sections:
* **First Sub-section:** Seven verses, explaining the meaning of the term
"Sabhavy", serving as an introduction.     * **Second Sub-section:** Fourteen
verses, explaining the substance (Dravyas).     * **Third Sub-section:** Five
verses, focusing on the substance of time (Kaaladravy).     * **Fourth Sub-
section:** 35 verses, explaining the soul substance (Jeevaastikaya).     *
**Fifth Sub-section:** Ten verses, focusing on the substance of matter
(Pudgalastikaya).     * **Sixth Sub-section:** Seven verses, explaining the
substances of merit and demerit (Dharmaadharmastikaya).     * **Seventh Sub-
section:** Seven verses, explaining the substance of space (Aakaashaastikaya).
* **Eighth Sub-section:** Eight verses, concluding with a summary of the
Panchaastikaya.  * **Second Mahaadhikars:** This section is further divided into
three sub-sections:     * **First Sub-section:** Two verses, offering
salutations to the chosen deities.     * **Second Sub-section:** Three verses,
providing a brief explanation of the Panchaastikaya.     * **Third Sub-
section:** One verse, defining the substances of the Panchaastikaya, including
time.     * **Fourth Sub-section:** One verse, addressing the potential for
confusion and providing clarification.  **Conclusion:**  This commentary, the
Panchaastikaya Praabhrut, provides a comprehensive and insightful explanation of
the Panchaastikaya, the six substances that constitute the universe, and their
relationship to the soul's liberation. It serves as a valuable guide for those
seeking to understand the profound teachings of Jainism.

The *Pancastikaya* is written in Prakrit verses, describing the six substances.
The commentary is in Sanskrit, composed by Jayasenacharya. [6] The language is
not for children, the essence is not easily understood. Therefore, I have made
this effort, meditating on the lotus feet of the Jinas. [7]  **Meaning:** I bow
to the Supreme Being, who is self-realized, victorious over karma, pure soul,
and eternally blissful.  **Introduction:** It is well known that Shri
Kumaranandi, a disciple of Shri Kundakunda Acharya, who is also known as
Padmanandi, Ailacharya, Vangriva, and Griddhapichcha, went to the land of the
liberated souls. There, he saw the liberated, omniscient, and supreme
Tirthankara, Shri Mandarswami, and listened to the divine words that emanated
from his lotus mouth. He understood the meaning of the substances from those
words and grasped the essence of the pure soul. Upon returning, he composed this
*Pancastikaya* Prakrit scripture to explain the inner and outer aspects of the
soul to his disciples, who were eager to learn, starting with Shivakumar
Maharaj. This commentary explains the meaning of this scripture in detail,
following the order of the chapters.  **Preface:** The first chapter, starting
with "Indasayavandiaan," consists of 111 verses and describes the six
substances. This chapter is also considered to be the first major chapter,
according to the commentary of Shri Amrit Chandra, and ends with the 103rd
verse. The second major chapter, starting with "Abhivandiun Siraasa," consists
of 50 verses and explains the seven principles and nine substances. According to
Shri Amrit Chandra's commentary, this chapter ends with the 48th verse. The
third major chapter, starting with "Jivasvabhavo," consists of 20 verses and
mainly discusses the path to liberation and the nature of liberation. Thus,
there are three major chapters, consisting of 181 verses in total.  Now, we will
discuss the sub-chapters within the first major chapter. Within the 111 verses,
the verses starting with "Indasay" up to the seventh verse mainly explain the
meaning of the word "time" in the preface. The next 14 verses explain the nature
of the substances, based on the preface. The next five verses mainly discuss the
substance of time. The following 33 verses describe the substance of the soul.
The next 10 verses mainly discuss the substance of matter. The next seven verses
explain the substances of merit, demerit, and space, based on the commentary.
The next seven verses mainly discuss the substance of space. The last eight
verses discuss the substance of the subtle body, in a concise manner. Thus, the
first major chapter, which describes the six substances, consists of eight sub-
chapters.

**The Beginning of the Sutra**  **Salutation to the Jinas**  At the beginning of
this scripture, the auspiciousness of salutation to the Jinas, in the form of
the invocation of the nature of the Jinas, has been obtained by the words, "Namo
Jinēbhyah."  **Verse 1**  "To those who are saluted by hundreds of Indras, whose
words are sweet, clear, and beneficial to the three worlds, whose qualities are
beyond limit, and who have conquered existence, to those Jinas, salutation."
**Explanation**  "Saluted by hundreds of Indras" - This indicates that they are
worthy of being saluted by all, as they are the supreme lords of the gods.
"Whose words are sweet, clear, and beneficial to the three worlds" - This refers
to the fact that their teachings are pure, free from all doubts, and beneficial
to all beings in the three worlds (heaven, earth, and hell).  "Whose qualities
are beyond limit" - This refers to their infinite knowledge, power, and
compassion.  "Who have conquered existence" - This refers to their liberation
from the cycle of birth and death.  **The Introduction to the Concept of Time**
These seven verses serve as an introduction to the concept of time. The first
two verses are a salutation to the Jinas, while the next three verses provide a
brief explanation of the five categories of time. The sixth verse defines the
five categories of time in terms of substance, and the seventh verse discusses
the rejection of the defects of confusion and contradiction. Thus, the
introduction to the concept of time is divided into three parts: salutation,
explanation, and definition.  **Verse 1**  **Word-by-word meaning:**
(Indrashatavanditēbhyah) - To those who are saluted by hundreds of Indras,
(Tribhuvanahitamdhuravishadavakyēbhyah) - whose words are beneficial to the
three worlds, sweet, and clear, (Antatītaguṇēbhyah) - whose qualities are beyond
limit, (Jitabhāvēbhyah) - who have conquered existence, (Jinēbhyah) - to those
Jinas, (Namah) - salutation.

6 Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas Translation by Samyai:
Here (in this verse), by saying "Salutations to the Jinas," an extraordinary
auspiciousness in the form of devotional salutations has been described at the
beginning of the scriptures. "Those who are flowing from an eternal stream and
are flowing from an eternal stream, are saluted by a hundred Indras." By saying
this, it has been said that they [the Jina Devas] are worthy of extraordinary
salutations because of their eternal nature as the supreme among the gods. Their
speech, that is, the divine sound, is beneficial because it tells the entire
group of living beings in the three realms, the upper, lower, and middle realms,
the means of attaining the pure self-nature. It is sweet because it captivates
the minds of those who are interested in the ultimate truth, and it is clear
[pure, distinct] because it removes all doubts and other defects." - By saying
this, [the Jina Devas] are worthy of the respect of wise and intelligent men
because they are the teachers of the true nature of all things [that is, their
teachings should be considered with respect by wise and intelligent men]. It has
been said that they have infinite qualities, which are the play of the supreme
conscious power, without end in space and without end in time. By saying this,
[the Jinas] are bound by the yogis who have attained supreme knowledge, because
they manifest supreme and extraordinary knowledge. "They have conquered the
world, that is, the cycle of birth and death." By saying this, it has been
taught that they [the Jinas] are the refuge of other living beings who have not
yet achieved liberation, because they have manifested their own liberation. This
is the meaning of all the words. Meaning: - First, keeping in mind the intention
of describing an extraordinary auspiciousness in the form of devotional
salutations to the Jinas at the beginning of the scriptures, beginning with
"Salutations to those who are saluted by a hundred Indras," this sutra is
explained. The explanation is in the form of a breakdown of the words "णमो
जिणाणं," which means "Salutations to the Jinas." To whom are the salutations? To
the Jinas. What kind of Jinas? "इंदसयवंदियाणं" - those who are saluted by a
hundred Indras. Again, what kind of Jinas?
"तिहुवणहिदमहुरबिसदवक्काणंत्रिभुवनहितमधुरविशदवाक्येभ्यः" - those whose words are
beneficial to the three realms, sweet, and clear. Again, what is special about
them? "अंतातीदगुणाणं" - those who have infinite qualities. Again, what is
special about them? "जिदभवाणं" - those who have conquered the world. This is the
relationship between the action and the agent. "Salutations to the Jinas, those
who are saluted by a hundred Indras, whose words are beneficial to the three
realms, sweet, and clear, who have infinite qualities, and who have conquered
the world." According to the sutra "पदयोर्विवक्षितः संधिर्न समासान्तरगतयो," the
intended compound is not within the scope of the compound. Therefore, it should
be known that there is no rule for compounding in this text, for the sake of
easy understanding for the primary student. Thus, this is a summary statement
that devotional salutations in the form of remembering their infinite knowledge
and other qualities are offered to the Jinas, who have these four qualities. Now
it is said - "Those who are saluted by a hundred Indras," by saying this, the
intention is to describe the greatness of their worship. What is being said? Are
they the only ones worthy of being saluted by a hundred Indras? No, because they
have witnessed the battles between the gods and demons. Their words are
beneficial because they teach the means of attaining the pure self-nature. They
are sweet because they are the source of the ultimate happiness, which is the
taste of the nectar of the ultimate truth, and they captivate the minds of those
who are interested in the ultimate truth. They are clear because they are free
from doubts, confusion, and delusion, which are like the touch of grass on a
pearl, and they are the form of pure knowledge of the seven principles and nine
substances.

From the fact that it is the expounder of the five-fold nature of the substance,
or from the fact that it is free from defects like contradiction, or from the
fact that it is the clear and distinct expression of the language of each of the
Karnata, Magadha, Malava, Lata, Gauda, and Gurjara, in the form of eighteen
great languages, seven hundred minor languages, and many languages,
simultaneously for all beings, and from the fact that it is the cause of
understanding and the informer of all beings, the divine sound, whose words are
sweet, clear, and beneficial to the three worlds, is from them. Thus it is said:
"That which is beneficial to all beings, not accompanied by any caste, not
uttered by moving lips, not desired, not tainted by any fault, not obstructed by
any obstacle. Heard by the ears of the peaceful, angry, and poisonous, along
with the animals, that word of the all-knowing, which has destroyed all
calamities, may protect us from the beginning." By expounding the excellence of
this word, it is said that this word itself is the proof, and not the word of
the non-human, nor the word of the mythical story, nor the word of the imagined
Purana. From the fact that it is the determiner of the substance, space, time,
and state beyond the end, the perfect knowledge quality exists in those who are
beyond the end, those who have the quality beyond the end are from them. By
expounding the excellence of knowledge, it is said that even the great yogis
like Ganadharadeva, who possess the sevenfold knowledge, including intellect,
and the fourfold knowledge, including omniscience, are worthy of worship. Those
who have conquered the fivefold cycle of existence, which is eternal and swift,
are from them. By expounding the excellence of the conqueror of the cycle of
existence, it is said that they are the refuge of others who have not achieved
their goal, and not others. Thus, salutations to those who possess these four
qualities. This salutation is done in the form of remembrance of the qualities
like infinite knowledge, etc. This fourfold quality conquers the karma-
afflicted, who are the cause of suffering from many deep subjects. In the case
of the derivation, it is for the purpose of stating the nature like a white
conch shell, and in the case of non-derivation, it is for the purpose of
defining the name Jina. Thus, the meaning of the word is stated in the form of
the relationship between the qualified and the qualifier. The salutation in the
form of remembrance of the qualities like infinite knowledge, etc., is according
to the impure determination, the salutation of the substance in the form of the
word "namo jinēbhyaḥ" is according to the false behavior, and the salutation in
the form of the word "namo jinēbhyaḥ" is according to the pure determination,
the attitude of worshiping oneself is according to the principle of the word.
The meaning of the principle is also stated in the form of "they are worthy of
worship, not others." The meaning of the scripture is well-known, like "Indra is
praised by hundreds." The meaning of the sentiment is that the pure being, who
possesses the qualities like infinite knowledge, etc., is the only one who is
worthy of worship. In this way, the meaning of the word, principle, scripture,
and sentiment is indicated. In this way, the meaning of the word, principle,
scripture, and sentiment is to be applied everywhere during the explanation. In
short, the salutation to the desired deity is done for the sake of
auspiciousness. The auspiciousness, the indication, the cause, the reason, the
quantity, and the non-doer are the six chapters, which are to be spoken as far
as possible. Now, according to the principle of behavior, the explanation of the
six chapters, starting with auspiciousness, with limited qualifications, is done
for the benefit of the students who are interested in details. "Mangala-nimitta-
heū parimāṇā nāma taha ya kattāraṁ. Ghāgariya chhappi pacchā vakkhāṇau satya-
māiriō." "Vakkhāṇau-vyākhyātu. Sa kaḥ kartā. Āiriō-ācāryaḥ. Kiṁ. Sattham-
śāstraṁ. Pacchā-paścāt. Kiṁkṛtvā pūrvam. Vāgariya-vyākṛtya vyākhyāya. Kān.

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  The description of the
six substances and five astikayas is given in three ways, depending on the
deity:  * **By whom:** This refers to the specific deity being invoked. * **By
the desired outcome:** This refers to the specific benefit sought from the
deity. * **By the type of salutation:** This refers to the specific form of
salutation used.  This auspiciousness is of two types: primary and secondary.
**Primary auspiciousness** is described as follows: "It is said that
auspiciousness is spoken of by the wise at the beginning, in the middle, and at
the end." This is followed by a hymn praising the qualities of Jinendra, for the
purpose of removing obstacles and achieving success.  **Secondary
auspiciousness** is described as follows:  * "The auspiciousness of the
Siddhattha, the Punna-kumbha, the garland of salutations, the white umbrella,
the seat, the color, the auspiciousness of the voice, the ears, and the tongue."
* "The auspiciousness of the merchant, the restraint, the guru, the association
with the Jina, the supreme goal, the Siddhasana, the Siddhattha." * "The
auspiciousness of the Punna, the mind, the knowledge, the complete knowledge,
the Arhat, the Punna-kumbha." * "The auspiciousness of the exit and entry, the
twenty-four salutations, the garland of salutations, the mind." * "The
auspiciousness of the umbrella, the Arhat, the umbrella, the Siddhi." * "The
auspiciousness of the seat, the color, the meditation, the knowledge, the
remaining karma, the Arhat, the seat, the color." * "The auspiciousness of the
world, the complete knowledge, the Jina, the auspiciousness of the moon, the
moon." * "The auspiciousness of the heroes, the Jina, the world, the
auspiciousness of the horse, the horse." * "The auspiciousness of the
blacksmith, the Jina, the liberation, the auspiciousness of the four, the four."
Alternatively, auspiciousness is also described as being of two types: bound and
unbound.  **Bound auspiciousness** is described as follows: "The leader of the
path to liberation, etc."  **Unbound auspiciousness** is described as follows:
"Salutation taken from other scriptures, such as 'To the Lord of the three
worlds,' etc."  In this context, the student raises an objection: "Why do the
authors of scriptures begin their scriptures with a hymn praising the qualities
of the Supreme Being for auspiciousness? Why not simply begin with the subject
matter of the scripture? Auspiciousness is irrelevant."  The teacher responds:
"It is not irrelevant. Auspiciousness brings merit, and merit removes
obstacles."  The student counters: "Why is this necessary? There are instances
where obstacles are encountered even after performing salutations, offerings,
and worship. Conversely, there are instances where obstacles are not encountered
even without performing salutations, offerings, and worship."  The teacher
explains: "This is not a contradiction. The ancient teachers always performed
actions preceded by salutations to their chosen deities. As you said, performing
salutations brings merit, and merit removes obstacles. This is not irrelevant.
Why? Because this is well-established in logic and other scriptures.
Furthermore, the instances you mentioned are not contradictions. When obstacles
are encountered even after performing salutations, offerings, and worship, it is
because of the fruits of past negative karma, not a flaw in the act of worship.
Conversely, when obstacles are not encountered even without performing
salutations, offerings, and worship, it is because of the fruits of past
positive karma, not a lack of negative karma."  The student continues: "Is the
scripture auspicious or inauspicious? If it is auspicious, then what is the
purpose of making it even more auspicious? If it is inauspicious, then what is
the purpose of the scripture?"  The teacher responds: "Auspiciousness is made
even more auspicious for the sake of devotion. As it is said, 'One may worship
the sun with a lamp, the ocean with water, and the goddess of speech with
auspicious words.' Furthermore, performing salutations to the chosen deity is
considered a reciprocal act of kindness."

"The perfection of the path of liberation comes from the grace of the Supreme
Being. This is what the great sages say in the scriptures like the Gunastotra."
(17) "The means to achieve the desired result is easy to understand, and it
comes from studying the scriptures. This is why the virtuous never forget the
kindness shown to them by the enlightened." (18) This is the explanation of the
auspiciousness of the consecration.  The reason is explained: What is the reason
for the initiation of the scripture of the omniscient, free from attachment, and
divine sound? It is due to the inspiration of the auspicious souls. As it is
said, "The auspicious souls see the rise of this auspicious sun, which shines
brightly due to the efforts of the devotees." (19) In the Prabhrit Grantha,
Shiva Kumar Maharaj says that the reason is to be understood elsewhere, such as
in the collection of substances, the excellence of the mind, etc. This is a
brief explanation of the reason. Now, the explanation of the cause. The cause is
the fruit. If you ask how the word "cause" refers to the fruit, it is because
the fruit is the effect of the cause. And that fruit is of two types, based on
the distinction between direct and indirect. Direct fruit is of two types, based
on the distinction between direct and indirect experience. What is direct
experience? It is the destruction of ignorance, the birth of knowledge, the
destruction of countless karmas, etc. What is indirect experience? It is the
worship of the teacher and the disciple, praise, the emergence of disciples,
etc. This is a brief explanation of the direct fruit. Now, the indirect fruit is
explained. It is of two types, based on the distinction between worldly
happiness and liberation. Worldly happiness is explained. It is the state of
being a king of kings, a great king, a ruler of a kingdom, a great ruler, a
half-wheel-turner, a full-wheel-turner, Indra, a Ganadhara deva, a Tirthankara,
a supreme deity, and the three auspicious ones. The characteristics of a king,
etc., are explained: One who is the lord of eighteen rows of a crore of
fortresses is called a crowned king, one who is the lord of five hundred crowned
kings is called a king of kings, and from there, it increases twofold, twofold,
until the state of a full-wheel-turner. This is worldly happiness. Now,
liberation is explained. The state of an Arhat is explained: "The Arhat is the
middle of the auspicious ones, with thirty-four hundredfold powers, fourfold
knowledge, and fivefold auspiciousness, and eight great virtues." (20) The state
of a Siddha is explained: "The Siddhas are auspicious, eightfold, beyond the
cycle of birth and death, free from the bondage of the five karmas, the seven
bonds, and the eight types of birth." (21) This is a brief explanation of
worldly happiness and liberation. The meaning here is that whoever studies and
believes in the scriptures like the Panchastikaya collection, which was compiled
by the omniscient, free from attachment, will attain this kind of happiness.
Now, the extent is explained. It is of two types, based on the distinction
between the meaning of the scripture and the scripture itself. The extent of the
scripture is the number of scriptures, as far as possible, and the extent of the
meaning is infinite. These two are distinguished as meaningful and accidental.
What is meaningful? The meaning is the same as the name, such as "tapan" means
"sun" because it burns. And the scripture in which the Panchastikaya is found is
called the Panchastikaya, the collection of substances is called the
Dravyasangraha, etc. Accidental is like "Ishvara" being the name of a wooden
weight, etc. The author is explained. He is of three types: the original author,
the subsequent author, and the subsequent subsequent author. The original
author, according to time, is Shri Vardhamana Swami, who is free from eighteen
faults and possesses the four infinite qualities. The subsequent author is Shri
Gautam Swami, the Ganadhara deva, who is four-treasured and possesses seven
half-qualities. The subsequent subsequent authors are many, as far as possible.
Why is the author explained? It is to show that the scripture is authoritative
because of the authority of the author. This is a brief explanation of the six
chapters of the auspiciousness. This is the auspiciousness, and the verses of
salutation to the desired deities have been recited. (1)

## Six Substances - Description of Five Astikayas - Hindi Meaning Commentary
First, in the beginning of this scripture, with the intention of offering a
unique auspicious salutation to the Jinas, in the form of the sentiment
expressed by the hundred Indras, the Acharya states the first sutra:  **10**
**General Meaning with Anvaya:** (Indasadbandiyaṇam) Saluted by a hundred
Indras, (Tihuṇa-Hidamdhura-Visad-Vakkāṇam) Benefactor of the three worlds,
speaking sweet and clear words, (Antaati-Guṇāṇam) Possessor of infinite
qualities, and (Jidbhavaṇam) Conqueror of the world, (Jiṇāṇam) To the Arhats
(Naṃo) Salutations.  **Specific Meaning:** Here, the Arhats are being saluted.
The remembrance of the infinite knowledge and other qualities of the Arhats is
called a salutation of sentiment. It is said that a hundred Indras saluted the
Arhats, thereby revealing the greatness of the Arhats' worthiness. It is also
stated that these Arhats are the only deities worthy of being saluted by a
hundred Indras. The words of the Arhats are beneficial because they show the way
to attain the nature of the pure soul. The natural, unparalleled, supreme bliss
that arises from the samadhi free from attachment and distractions, that is the
certainty of happiness, the taste of its essence, that is the supreme state of
equanimity, those who are attracted to its essence, those human beings, are
captivating to their minds, and they are clear and expressed, because there is
no doubt, delusion, or confusion in those words. This is a shell or silver, such
fickle knowledge is called doubt. The desire to be certain that something will
happen when the grass touches the foot is called delusion. To know the shell as
silver is delusion. And those words are also clear because they describe the
seven principles, nine substances, six substances, and five astikayas, starting
with the pure jiva astikaya. Or, there is no contradiction between the past and
the future in those words, which also makes them clear. Or, all beings hear the
divine sound of the Arhats in their own language and understand it clearly.
There are eighteen major languages, including Kannada, Magadhi, Malwa, Lata,
Gauda, and Gurjara, each with three divisions, and seven hundred minor
languages, and that voice is heard by all at the same time in many languages,
which also makes it clear.  **In other scriptures, it is said about the words of
the Arhats:**  That unparalleled word of the omniscient Lord, free from all
defects, protects us, which is beneficial to all souls, is not in the form of
letters, manifests without the movement of the lips, is without desire, is not
stained by faults, and does not have the sequence of stopping and starting of
breath.

The five-astīkāya, beginning with the one who has pacified the poison of anger,
which even the animal kingdom can hear with their ears. ||1|| Thus, the word of
the Arhant, revealed through the greatness of the word, is the proof. The word
that is secluded, non-human, not spoken by any man, and not composed of various
stories, is the proof of the Purāṇa.  **Meaning:** The word is the proof that
describes through anekanta or syādvāda, and that is spoken by the tradition of a
सर्वज्ञ (omniscient) man. It is said that the Arhants have infinite knowledge,
etc., because they know the infinite dravya, kṣetra, kāla, and bhāva. This means
that they are worthy of worship, even by the Ganadhara Devas, who are the
holders of the seven ṛiddhis, such as buddhi, and the four jñānas, such as
matijñāna. The Arhants have conquered the world, which is in the form of the
five parāvartanās, namely dravya, kṣetra, kāla, bhava, and bhāva. This means
that they have achieved their purpose through the greatness of the destruction
of the yātiyas and the konkas. For those who are not accomplished, who are
ignorant worldly beings, the Arhants are the only refuge. Thus, the Jinas have
been worshipped with four special qualities. This is a worshipful feeling of
remembering the infinite knowledge, etc. The Jina is the one who conquers the
enemies in the form of karma, which are the causes of falling into the many
forests in the form of bhava, the objects of the senses, and the calamities.
These four qualities are given to him in the same way as saying that the conch
is white. Even by simply saying conch, one understands its whiteness. Similarly,
by the mere etymology of the word Jina, one understands his infinite qualities.
However, the qualities are given to show the specialness and to indicate that
the worship is not for those who are called Jina only in name. This is the
meaning of the special quality and the special object. This is the meaning of
the word.  The feeling of remembering the infinite knowledge, etc., is the
worship. To know it through the impure niścaya naya is to know the word "namo
jinebhyaḥ" as a dravya in the form of worship. To know it through the asadbhuta
vyavahāra naya is to know it as a worshipful object and a worshipper in one's
own soul. To know it through the pure niścaya naya is to know it as a non-dual
feeling, that this soul is worthy of worship and is the worshipper. This is the
meaning of the naya. These Arhant Devas are worthy of worship, not any other
passionate, hateful, or ignorant being. This reveals the meaning of the Jina
dharma. Saying that they are worthy of worship by a hundred Indras reveals the
meaning of the tradition and the āgama. The meaning of this mangalācaraṇa is
that only the pure jīvāstīkāya, which is endowed with infinite knowledge, etc.,
is worthy of acceptance. Thus, one should know the meaning of the word, the
meaning of the naya, the meaning of the dharma, the meaning of the āgama, and
the meaning of the feeling. In the same way, wherever...

## 12. Description of the Five Categories of Substance  **Explanation:** In all
places, one should understand the meaning of the five categories: words, logic,
opinion, scripture, and emotion. In this way, for auspiciousness, the desired
deity is saluted. Auspiciousness is a suggestive term, and along with it, five
things should be mentioned as much as possible: the purpose of the text, the
reason, the extent, the name, and the author.  Now, here, for the sake of
students who are interested in hearing in detail, a special explanation of the
six categories, starting with auspiciousness, is given, relying on the practical
logic. This is an ancient saying:  "The great teacher, before doing anything
else, should first mention the six: auspiciousness, purpose, reason, extent,
name, and author, and then explain the scripture." (2)  The same is shown
further:  (1) "Mangal" means that which melts or destroys evil or sin, or that
which brings virtue and happiness, that is, gives it, is auspicious. The author
of the text, desiring four types of results in the beginning of the scripture,
salutes the deity in three ways. The four types of results are:  **Meaning:** To
show that the author of the text is a believer, to follow the rules of courtesy
and humility that have come down through tradition, to gain merit, and to remove
obstacles. For these four reasons, the deity is praised at the beginning of the
text. (3)  The three ways of saluting the deity are: that which is desired, that
which is authorized, and that which is respectable. There are also three types
of salutation: one is in the form of a blessing, the second is in the form of a
statement of the nature of the object, and the third is in the form of a simple
salutation.  This auspiciousness is of two types: primary and secondary. The
primary auspiciousness is the praise of the qualities of the Jina. As it is
said:  **Meaning:** The wise have said that one should perform auspiciousness at
the beginning, middle, and end, so that obstacles are destroyed. That
auspiciousness is the praise of the qualities of the Jina. (4)  It is also said:
**Meaning:** By praising the qualities of the Jinas, obstacles are destroyed,
fear never arises, inferior deities do not transgress, and one always obtains
the desired objects. (5)  It is also said:

The disciple becomes proficient in knowledge by doing auspicious things at the
beginning, including the five auspicious things, the meaning, etc., the
knowledge comes without obstacles by doing auspicious things in the middle, and
the fruit of knowledge is obtained by doing auspicious things at the end. ||6||
Further, the secondary auspicious things are called: Meaning - Siddhartha,
Purnakumbha, Vandanamaala, Shwetachatra, Shwetavarna, Aadarasha or Darpan, Naath
(King), Kanya and Jayapana. ||7|| Those who have achieved the ultimate goal
through vows, rules, restraint, etc., and whose name is Siddha, are therefore
Siddhartha auspicious. ||8|| Those who are full of all desires and only
knowledge, such Arhants are Purnakumbha auspicious in this world. ||9|| Bharat
Chakra created the Vandanamaala, when someone exits or enters through a door,
they become worthy of being worshipped by the twenty-four Tirthankaras,
therefore Vandanamaala is called auspicious. ||10|| For the beings of the world,
Arhant Bhagwan is the easy doer, they are like protectors, therefore they are
called Shwetachatra. ||11|| Those Arhants who have white color, white
meditation, and whose four non-virtuous karmas remain, such Arhants are called
Shwetavarna auspicious. ||12|| Just as the reflection appears in the mirror,
similarly, the world and the non-world are seen in the only knowledge of the
Jineendras, therefore Aadarasha is auspicious. ||13|| Just as the Vitaraga
Sarvagya Jineendra is auspicious, similarly, the king and the child girl in the
world should also be considered auspicious. ||14|| Those who have conquered the
enemies of karma and attained liberation - conquering the four armies of
enemies, which are the four types of karma, is called Jayarupa auspicious.
||15|| Or, auspiciousness is of two types - one is bound auspiciousness, the
other is unbound auspiciousness. The auspiciousness that is done by the same
author of the text is bound auspiciousness, such as 'Mokshamargasya Netaram'
etc. The auspiciousness that is brought from another text and used for
salutation is unbound auspiciousness, such as "Jagattrayanaathay" etc. In this
regard, some disciple raises this prior argument and argues that - why do the
authors of the scriptures praise the qualities of the Supreme Being for
auspiciousness at the beginning of the scriptures? One should only say what is
being started, there is no need for auspiciousness. It should also not be said
that auspiciousness in the form of salutation brings merit, and merit makes the
work free from obstacles, because saying so leads to contradiction. Sometimes,
obstacles are seen while doing salutation, donation, worship, etc., and
sometimes, work is seen to be free from obstacles even without donation,
worship, and salutation? The Acharya solves this by saying - O disciple! Your
saying this is not appropriate. In the past, the Acharyas started the work only
after saluting the Ishtadevata first.  :.: .-  .-

## Chapter 14  The six substances and five astikayas were described. You said
that one should not say that namaskara (salutation) leads to punya (merit) and
punya prevents obstacles. This statement of yours is also not correct, because
it has been proven in logic and other disciplines that saluting the deity leads
to punya and punya leads to obstacle-free actions. Then you said that believing
this leads to vyabhichar (deviation). This is also not correct, because where
obstacles occur even while performing dharma (righteousness) like saluting the
deity, giving charity, and worship, one should understand that it is the result
of past sins, not a fault of the means of dharma. And where obstacle-free
actions are seen even without performing dharma like saluting the deity, giving
charity, and worship, one should understand that it is the result of past
dharma, not the result of sins. Then the disciple asks: Is the scripture itself
auspicious or inauspicious? If the scripture is auspicious, then what is the
purpose of doing auspicious things with auspicious things? And if the scripture
is inauspicious, then what purpose will be achieved from such a scripture? The
Acharya Maharaj also provides a solution to this: Auspicious things are done for
the sake of devotion. As it is said:  **Meaning:** People worship the sun with a
lamp, the ocean with water, and Saraswati (goddess of learning) with speech,
just like this, auspicious things are worshipped with auspicious things. ||16||
And also, saluting the Ishtadevata (chosen deity) leads to acceptance of their
favor, as it is said:  **Meaning:** The attainment of the path of liberation is
through the grace of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, in the scriptures, the main
ones praise their qualities at the beginning. ||17||  And it is also said:
**Meaning:** The means of attaining the desired result is right knowledge. Right
knowledge comes from the true scriptures. The origin of those scriptures is from
the Aapta (divine beings). Therefore, those Aapta Devas are worthy of worship,
through whose grace there are three types of intellect. Righteous people do not
forget the favors done to them. ||18||  In this way, the auspiciousness has been
stated briefly. Next, the cause for which this scripture was created is called
the cause of the cause. The reason for the divine sound being manifested by the
Vitaraga Sarvagna Bhagwan is the inspiration of the punya of the bhavya jivas
(evolving souls). As it is said:  **Meaning:** The bhavya jivas, through the
divine radiance of the sun in the form of Shrutagyan (scriptural knowledge),
have faith in the knowledge of the six substances and nine substances.
Therefore, the sun in the form of Shrutagyan rises. ||19||  Here, the cause of
this Prabhrit Granth (this scripture) is Shiv Kumar Maharaj. Just as in the
Dravyasangrah (collection of substances) and other scriptures, Moma Seth and
others were the cause, it should be understood in this way. In this way, the
cause has been explained briefly. Now...

The **Panchaastikaya Praabhrut** explains 15 **Hetukas**. **Hetuka** is also
called **Phal** (fruit) because it is the cause of the fruit, hence it is called
**Phal** by implication. This **Phal** is of two types: **Pratyaksha Phal**
(direct fruit) and **Paroksha Phal** (indirect fruit). **Pratyaksha Phal** is
also of two types: **Saakshaat** (direct) and **Parampara** (tradition).
**Saakshaat Pratyaksha Phal** is the destruction of ignorance and the birth of
**Samyaggyaan** (right knowledge) from this scripture, and the destruction of
countless **Karma** (actions) in the form of **Gun श्रेणी** (series of
qualities), etc. **Parampara-Pratyaksha-Phal** is the worship and praise of the
teacher by the disciple, and the acquisition of disciples. **Bhaavarth**
(meaning): Many people benefit from reading it. This is how **Pratyaksha Phal**
is explained in brief. Now, **Paroksha Phal** is explained. This is also of two
types: **Saansaarik Aishvarya Sukh** (worldly prosperity and happiness) and
**Moksha-Sukh** (liberation happiness). Now, **Aishvarya Sukh** is explained.
**Rajaadhiraaj**, **Maharaaja**, **Ardhamandaleek**, **Mandaleek**,
**Mahamaandaleek**, **Ardhachkravarti**, **Chakravarti**, **Indra**, **Ganathar
Dev**, **Teerthankar Paramdev** - these 18 categories are the leaders of the
army, crown-wearers. The overlord of five hundred crown-wearers is
**Adhiraaja**, and from there, the owners of twice the number of troops, up to
**Sakal Chakravarti**, this is **Aishvarya Sukh**. Now, **Moksha** or **Param
Kalyanmay Sukh** (supreme blissful happiness) is explained. It is the attainment
of the **Arhant** and **Siddh** state. The nature of **Arhant** is explained:
Those who have destroyed the four **Ghatiya Karmas** (destructive actions) and
attained the thirty-four **Atishya** (supernatural powers), eight
**Praatihaarya** (miracles), and five **Kalyanak** (auspicious events) are
**Arhant**. They are auspicious for me. ||20|| The nature of **Siddh** is
explained: Those who are free from the bondage, arising, and existence of
**Mool** (root) and **Uttar** (later) **Karma** (actions), who possess eight
qualities, and who have transcended the world, are the auspicious **Siddh
Bhagwan** (liberated beings). ||21|| This is how **Aishvarya** and **Moksha
Sukh** are explained in brief. The implication is that whoever reads this
**Panchaastikaya Praabhrut** etc. scripture, which is spoken by the **Veetaraag
Sarvgyaan** (omniscient, free from attachment), with faith, and contemplates it
repeatedly, attains this kind of happiness. Now, **Parimaan** (quantity) is
explained. It is of two types: **Granth Parimaan** (textual quantity) and **Arth
Parimaan** (meaning quantity). **Granth Parimaan** is the number of verses or
stanzas in the text, which should be known as much as possible. **Arth
Parimaan** is infinite. This is how **Parimaan** is explained in brief. Now,
**Naam** (name) is explained. **Naam** is of two types: **Anvarth** (literal)
and **Ichchhit** (desired). If the meaning of the text is the same as its name,
it is **Anvarth**. For example, **Tapa** (heat) is **Tapan** (heat) or **Surya**
(sun). Similarly, the scripture in which the five **Astikaya** are explained is
**Panchaastikaya**, or the scripture that contains a collection of **Dravya**
(substance) is **Dravya Sangrah**, etc. **Ichchhit Naam** is like calling the
one who carries the load of wood **Ishwar** (God), etc. Now, the **Karta**
(author) of the text is explained. **Karta** is of three types: **Mool Tantra
Karta** (original author), **Uttar Tantra Karta** (later author), and
**Utteroottar Tantra Karta** (successive author). Among these, the **Mool Tantra
Karta** is the last **Teerthankar** of this time, the eighteenth...

## 16 ## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  The author is the
faultless, infinite fourfold, Shri Vardhamana Swami. The commentator of the
Uttara Tantra is the four-knowledgeable and seven-wealthy Shri Gautam Swami, the
Ganadhara. There are many other commentators in succession.   **Meaning:** Here,
the author of this text is Shri Kundakunda Acharya. The author says this because
the authority of the author establishes the authority of his words. In this way,
the six aspects of auspiciousness, cause, reason, quantity, name, and author
have been described in brief. In this way, the verse related to the salutation
of the Ishta Devata for auspiciousness is complete.  **Verse 2: Explanation of
Time**  **Time** is the Agama. It has been promised here to be described after
salutation.   (The meaning of the verse) The teachings from the mouth of the
Shramanas, which are the cessation of the four gatis and Nirvana.   I bow my
head and will speak of this time, listen. || 2 ||  It is appropriate to bow and
describe it because it is successful due to being taught by an Apt. There, its
being taught by an Apt is because it is the meaning that has come from the mouth
of the Shramanas. The Shramanas are the great Shramanas, the omniscient, the
free from passions. The meaning, again, is one thing to be described, though it
is described through many words. Its success is because it is the cessation of
the four gatis, which are hell, animal, human, and god, and because it is the
cause of Nirvana, which is the cessation of dependence, the attainment of pure
self-nature, and because it is the cause of the fruit, which is the attainment
of independence. || 2 ||  **Hindi Explanation of Verse 2**  **Meaning:** (The
meaning that has come from the mouth of the Shramanas) The meaning that has come
from the mouth of the Shramanas (the words spoken by the omniscient great monks)
(the cessation of the four gatis) the cessation of the four gatis and (Nirvana)
Nirvana (the cause of Nirvana) [this time] such this time [bowing my head]
bowing my head in salutation (I will speak) I will speak of it [listen] listen
to it.  **Commentary:** Time means Agama. I will speak of it after saluting it.
Such a promise has been made here. It (time) is worthy of salutation and
description because it is successful due to being taught by an Apt. There, its
being taught by an Apt is because it is the meaning that has come from the mouth
of the Shramanas (the omniscient). 'Shramanas' means the great Shramanas, the
omniscient, the free from passions, and 'meaning' means one thing to be
described, though it is described through many words.

## 17  The success of time (kāla) is due to the fact that it (1) prevents the
four paths of hell (narka), animal existence (tiryanch), human existence
(manushya), and godhood (devatva), and (2) leads to the attainment of pure soul
(ātma) essence, which is characterized by freedom from dependence (paratantra)
and the attainment of independence (svatantrata), and is the ultimate cause of
liberation (nirvāṇa) in a sequential manner. ||2||

## Chapter 18: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  **How is
the description of the six substances and five astikayas?**  The explanation is
the Acharya's words in the form of a commentary, the Gatha Sutra is to be
explained, this is the commentary to be explained.   **Relationship:**  The word
"dravya" (substance) refers to the meaning of the word "agama" (scripture),
"rupa" (form), "sabda" (sound), and "samaya" (time). The word "panchaastikaya"
(five astikayas) refers to the meaning of the word "lakshana" (characteristics)
and "artha" (meaning) and "samaya" (time). This is the relationship between the
word and its meaning.   **Result and Purpose:**  The result and purpose are to
eliminate ignorance, etc., and to attain the ultimate bliss of Nirvana. These
relationships, meanings, and purposes should be known.  **Meaning:**  Thus, the
first part of the text has been covered with two verses, primarily with the
salutation to the desired and chosen deity.  **Hindi Meaning:**  **Verse 2:**
After saluting the word "agama" (scripture) which is in the form of the "dravya"
(substance) shastra, I will describe the meaning of the "panchaastikaya" (five
astikayas) in the form of "artha" (meaning) and "samaya" (time). With this
promise, I salute my honorable deity, who is attained in the authority, and I
indicate the relationship, meaning, and purpose. This is the intention in my
mind, and I will now speak the next sutra.  **Meaning with Anvaya:**  (Eso) This
I, who am Kundakunda Acharya, (samana muhuggadam) having emerged from the mouth
of the great Shraman, who is free from attachment and omniscient,
(chaduggadinivaranam) who removes the four gatis (paths) of hell, etc.,
(sanivvanam) who gives Nirvana, the destruction of all karmas, (attha) to the
group of substances, including the jiva (soul), (sirasa) with the best part of
my head, (panamiya) I salute, (inam samayan) this word "agama" (scripture) and
"panchaastikaya" (five astikayas), (vochchhami) I will speak, (sunah) O noble
beings! Listen to it.  **Meaning:**  May that word of the Jina, which is
profound, sweet, very captivating, free from faults, beneficial, free from the
causes of speech like the throat, lips, etc., not revealed by the stopping of
the wind, clear, the speaker of the ultimate beneficial substances, all
language-based, heard equally by the distant and the near, in the form of
equality, and free from comparisons, protect us.  **Meaning:**  By which the
spread of the darkness of ignorance is removed, and by which, upon knowing the
beneficial and harmful substances that are to be known, the being attains the
abandonment of the harmful, the acceptance of the beneficial, and ultimate
detachment, by which right faith is revealed, and the faith in the false is
removed, and by which the false conduct of night and day is kept away, may the
rise of that knowledge-like ultimate sun take place in the blossoming of my
mind-like lotus, or another explanation is as follows: This I, who am Kundakunda
Acharya, who is eager to do the work of writing the text, having emerged from
the mouth of the Shraman, and who speaks the meaning of the "panchaastikaya"
(five astikayas) with characteristics, and who is the direct witness of the
"dravya" (substance) "agama" (scripture) in the form of words, which removes the
four gatis (paths) and gives Nirvana, I salute, and for the sake of the fame of
knowledge-time...

## The Five Astikayas and Time  **19**  I will speak of the time, a near-perfect
man, a liberated, omniscient, hears the word-agamas, then knows the meaning of
the five astikayas, which is the essence of the agamas. Then, in that group of
objects, he becomes firm in the pure jiva-astikaya, and eliminates the four
movements. By eliminating the four movements, he attains the fifth movement,
nirvana. There, he experiences infinite bliss, the fruit of nirvana, which is
characterized by freedom from suffering, arising from his own soul. Therefore,
it is right to bow down to this time, which is in the form of a substance, or
the word-agamas.  In this explanation, the relationship, the object, and the
purpose are indicated as follows:  The words of the Acharya, which are in the
form of an explanation, are the explanation. The gatha sutras are worthy of
explanation, so they are the object of explanation. This is the relationship
between the explanation and the object of explanation.  The word-time or agamas,
which is in the form of a substance, is the name - the speaker. The meaning of
the five astikayas, which is the essence of the word-time or agamas, is the
object of speech - the thing to be spoken. This is the relationship between the
name and the object of speech.  The fruit or purpose is the attainment of
nirvana bliss, which includes the destruction of ignorance, etc. In this way,
one should know the relationship, the object, and the purpose.  In this way, the
first section is completed with two gathas, mainly for the purpose of bowing
down to one's beloved and honorable deity. || 2 ||  **Time Explanation Gatha -
3**  Here, the word "time" has three meanings: word, knowledge, and object. The
division of the world and the non-world is also mentioned.  The five astikayas
are called "time" by the best Jinas. That which is the world is the five
astikayas, then the non-world is the infinite, and the space is the void. || 3
||  There, the middle ground of the five astikayas, which is not affected by
attachment and aversion, and which is characterized by the arrangement of
letters, words, and sentences, is the word-time, the word-agamas, and so on.
The elimination of the rise of false views in them is the right path, the
knowledge-time, the knowledge-agamas, and so on.  The combination of these,
which is limited by name, understanding, and definition, is the object-time, the
essence of all objects, and so on.  Here, the object-time is intended to be
explained in relation to the word-time, in order to make the knowledge-time
clear. Therefore, the object-time itself has two forms, due to the alternative
of the world and the non-world.  The combination of the five astikayas is the
world, as long as it exists. Beyond that is the infinite non-world. It is not
merely non-existence, but an infinite field, space, and void, which is beyond
the combination of the five astikayas. || 3 ||

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  **Hindi Commentary
Verse 3: Anvayaartha (Dialogue of the Five)**  The five Astikayas are described
in an equal manner (or) their Samavaya (the five Astikayas' correct
understanding or their collective whole) is the time (Samaya). This is what the
Jinas have said. That is the Lok (world) (the Lok is as much as the group of the
five Astikayas). Beyond that is the infinite Alok (non-world) (Khamba) which is
the form of space.  **Commentary:**  Here (in this verse), the word "Samaya" has
been explained in three ways: in terms of words, knowledge, and meaning (Shabda
Samaya, Jnana Samaya, and Artha Samaya). The division of Lok and Alok has also
been explained.  There, (1) 'Sam' means the middle ground, that which is not
distorted by attachment and aversion, 'Vad' means the group of letters (Akshar),
words (Shabda), and sentences (Vakya). The 'Samavad' of the five Astikayas means
the middle ground (not distorted by attachment and aversion) text. Oral or
scriptural description) that is Shabda Samaya, that is, Shabdaagama is that
Shabda Samaya. (2) When the rise of false views is destroyed, the correct
understanding of the five Astikayas, that is, correct knowledge, is Jnana
Samaya, that is, Jnanaagama is that Jnana Samaya. (3) The Samavaya (group) of
the five Astikayas, which has become seven due to the cause of creation, is the
Artha Samaya in terms of substance, that is, the group of all substances is that
Artha Samaya. In this, they want to explain Artha Samaya in relation to Shabda
Samaya for the sake of the fame of Jnana Samaya (Shrimad Bhagavat
Kundakundaacharya Dev).  Now, that same Artha Samaya has a duality due to the
difference between Lok and Alok. The Lok is as much as the group of the five
Astikayas. Beyond that is the immeasurable (Amap) or infinite Alok. That Alok is
not just absence, but the space that is infinite in extent, leaving behind the
area equal to the group of the five Astikayas. ||3||  **Sanskrit Commentary
Verse 3:**  Now, keeping in mind the intention to explain the word "Samaya" in
three ways: in terms of words, knowledge, and meaning, and to explain the
division of Lok and Alok in the latter half of the verse, this sutra is being
said. Similarly, in the future, while explaining the intended and unintended
meaning of the sutra, or by deciding that this sutra is appropriate before this
sutra, this sutra is being explained. This is the characteristic of Patanika,
which should be known everywhere as far as possible.  Sama Tao Panchanham - The
Samavaya (group) of the five, starting with Jiva (soul) and ending with Artha
(substance). Samaya Minam - This Samaya is what the Jinas have said
(Pannavattanjinarai). So Chev Havdi Logo - That is the group of the five, that
is the Lok. Tat To - From that, from the Samavaya of the five, starting with
Jiva and ending with Artha, Amao - Amito Aparaman (infinite, immeasurable).

The term "Panchaastikaya" or "Amo" refers to the five fundamental entities: Jiva
(soul), Pudgala (matter), Dharma (motion), Adharma (rest), and Akasha (space).
These entities are not created by anyone, not even by the Lok (world). The term
"Alok" or "Aloyakkha" refers to the infinite pure space beyond the Lok.   The
term "Samaya" (time) has three interpretations:  1. **Shabda Samaya (Word
Time):** This refers to the textual description of the five entities, including
their characteristics and relationships. 2. **Jnana Samaya (Knowledge Time):**
This refers to the understanding and realization of the five entities, free from
doubt, delusion, and confusion. 3. **Artha Samaya (Meaning Time):** This refers
to the actual existence and interaction of the five entities, forming the Lok.
The Lok is defined as the realm where the five entities exist and interact. It
is characterized by the presence of Jiva, Pudgala, Dharma, Adharma, and Akasha.
The Lok is finite, while the Alok is infinite and pure space beyond the Lok.

## Six Substances - Description of Five Astikayas  The knowledge of the essence
of the six substances, which is the object of knowledge, is called 'Artha
Samaya'. Here, based on the 'Shabda Samaya', the explanation of 'Artha Samaya'
begins to establish the 'Jnana Samaya'. This 'Artha Samaya' is called 'Loka'. It
is like this: whatever is perceived by the five senses is called 'Pudgala
Astikaya'. Whatever is conscious is called 'Jiva Astikaya'. In the movement of
Jiva and Pudgala, 'Dharma' is the cause, and in their state, 'Adharma' is the
cause. 'Akasha' is the cause of their perception, and 'Kala' is the cause of
their existence. The area where these exist is called 'Loka'. It is said that
where Jiva and other substances are perceived, that is 'Loka'. The twelve
infinite pure Akashas are called 'A-Loka'. This is the meaning of the Sutra. ||
3 ||  ## Uththānika - Further Description of Five Astikayas  **Verse 4:**  Here,
the specific names of the five Astikayas, their general and specific existence,
and their nature as a body are explained. Jiva, Pudgala, Dharma, Adharma, and
Akasha. They are always constant, non-dual, and exist in both minute and large
forms. || 4 ||  **Explanation:**  Jiva, Pudgala, Dharma, Adharma, and Akasha are
their specific names, and their meanings are clear. Their general and specific
existence can be understood from their constant nature and their existence in
the form of creation, destruction, and change. Although they are constant, they
are not non-dual, because they are always self-existent and non-dual. Even
though they are non-dual, their constant existence is due to the application of
'Naya'. The Lord has established two 'Nayas': 'Dravyaartha' and 'Paryayaartha'.
The teachings are not based on one 'Naya' but on both. Therefore, due to the
'Paryayaartha' teaching, they are considered to be constantly existing, and due
to the 'Dravyaartha' teaching, they are considered to be self-existent and non-
dual. Their nature as a body is due to their existence in both minute and large
forms. The minute particles are the parts of the body, both tangible and
intangible, and they are indivisible. The large particles are formed by the
accumulation of these minute particles. This proves their nature as a body. The
term 'Anu-Mahaanta' (minute and large) is derived from the combination of two
minute particles. Even the combination of two minute particles is considered to
be a body. The minute and large particles are considered to be the form of
individual power. Therefore, even though a single particle is considered to be a
single space, it is still considered to be a body. The large particles are not
considered to be a body because they are not formed by the accumulation of
space, but by the accumulation of power. Therefore, even though 'Kala' (time) is
considered to be constantly existing, it is not considered to be a body.

## Translation:  **Verse 4:**  The five Astikayas, beginning with the Jiva, are
thus not non-existent even in the case of the Astikaya-prakarana.  **Hindi
Commentary:**  **Anvayaartha:** (Jiva) Jiva, (Pudgalakaya) Pudgalakaya, (Dharma-
Adharma) Dharma, Adharma, (Tatha Evam) Thus, (Akasham) Akash (Astitve Niyata)
are fixed in existence (Ananyamaya) (from existence) are non-different [ ] and
(Anu-Mahaanta) are large in the region of the Anu.  **Tika:** Here (in this
verse) the special names of the five Astikayas, the general-specific-existence
and the karayatva are mentioned.  There, Jiva, Pudgal, Dharma, Adharma and Akash
- Graha are their special names, to be known accordingly. They are fixed in the
general-specific existence of production-destruction, Dhrauvyamयी, due to their
being established in the general-specific existence, it should be ascertained
that they also have general-specific existence. Even though they are fixed in
existence, they are not different from existence, because their origin is always
from non-difference. Even though they are "non-different from existence", their
"being fixed in existence" is a Nayaprayoga. Bhagwan has mentioned two Nays -
Dravyarthic and Paryayarthic. There, the statement is not subject to one Nay,
but to two Nays. Therefore, they are established in existence (fixed) from the
Paryayarthic statement, which is somewhat different from itself, and due to
being self-existent from the Dravyarthic statement, they are non-different from
existence.  **23**  They also have Kayapana, because they are Anu-Mahaanta.
Here, Anu means the region, both concrete and abstract, indivisible [smallest]
part, 'being great by them (by many regions)' that is Anu-Mahaanta, that is,
Pradeshprachayatmak (being a collection of regions) is Anu-Mahaanta. Thus, their
(the above five substances) Kayatva is proved. [In the above derivation of Anu-
Mahaanta, the plural has been used for Anus, that is, regions, and according to
the rules of the Sanskrit language, the dual is not included in the plural,
therefore, now, by slightly changing the language in the derivation, the dual-
Anuk Skandhas are also shown to be Anu-Mahaanta, proving their Kayatva] 'Being
great by two Anus (two regions)' that is Anu-Mahaanta - by such derivation, the
dual-Anuk Pudgalaskandhas also have Kayatva (due to being Anu-Mahaanta). [Now,
how are the atoms Anu-Mahaanta? By explaining this, the Kayatva of the atoms is
also proved] Due to being Anu and Mahaanta in the form of individual and power
(that is, the atom being one-region in the form of individual and many-region in
the form of power), the atoms also have Kayatva, even though they are one-region
in nature (due to the proof of Anu-Mahaanta). Due to the lack of
Pradeshprachayatmak Mahaanta in the form of individual and power, the KalAnus,
even though they are fixed in existence, still...

The description of the six substances and the five categories of existence is
not contradictory. This is proven by the statement itself. Therefore, although
they exist, they are not included in the category of existence. ||4||
**Sanskrit Commentary Verse 4**  Now, the specific names of the five categories
of existence, their general and specific nature, and their existence as bodies
are explained. - The living beings, the particles, the dharma, the adharma, and
the space are the specific names of the five categories of existence. They
should be understood as being in accordance with their meaning. They are
definitely established in their existence, in the general and specific nature of
existence. Then, they would be different from each other, like berries in a pot.
This is not the case. They are not separate from their own existence, just as
the form and other qualities are in a pot, the hands and feet are in the body,
and the essence is in the pillar. This explanation shows that even in the
relationship of support and supported, there is no destruction of existence.
Now, the nature of the body is explained. They are large in terms of particles,
because the word "particle" refers to space here, and they are large in terms of
particles, because they are made up of many particles. They are large in terms
of two particle aggregates, because they are large in terms of two particles.
This is the nature of the body. If it is asked, how can there be a body of one
space? Then, it is said that the nature of the body is due to the power of
smoothness and roughness, which is the cause of the aggregates, and is present
in them. The nature of the body is not present in the particles of time, because
they do not have the power of smoothness and roughness, which is the cause of
bondage. Why is there no power? Because they are immortal. Thus, the specific
names of the five categories of existence, their existence, and their nature as
bodies have been explained. The meaning of this verse is that the pure living
being, which is the body of infinite knowledge, etc., is being explained here.
||4||  **Hindi Commentary Verse 4**  Meaning with Anvaya - (Living beings)
infinite living beings (particles) infinite particles, existence [dharma,
adharma] one dharma existence, one adharma existence (taheva) similarly (akhand
aakash) one undivided space - all these [asthithamhi] in their existence or in
their being [niyada] are definite (y) and [anannamahiya] are not separate from
their own existence or are one with each other, and [anumahanta] are many in
space or are multi-spatial.  Specific Meaning - There are two types of existence
- one is general existence or maha-satta, and the other is specific existence or
avantara-satta. These five categories of existence, living beings, etc., are
situated in both these types of existence. They are not like berries in a pot,
which are separate from each other, but they are all one with each other or non-
different from their own existence. Just as form, etc., are pervasive in a pot,
or hands and feet are in the body, or the essence is in the pillar. This
statement shows that even without the support and supported, the oneness of
existence is said to be with them. The space is knowable by particles,
therefore, the word "particle" should be taken here to mean space. So, all these
five substances or categories of existence are larger than their spaces,
therefore, they are anumahanta. Two particle aggregates are great because of two
particles.

The five Astikayas are said to be Anu-Mahant (minutely great) because they are
the basis of the five Astikayas. Therefore, they are called Kayapana (having a
body). The Kayapana of a single Pradesh (space) atom is due to the fact that
these atoms form Skandhas (aggregates) due to their oily or rough qualities.
Therefore, they are Kayapana due to their use or application. Kalaanu (time
atoms) do not have the power of oiliness or roughness due to their mutual
binding. Therefore, they are not Kayapana even by application. The absence of
this power in them is because all Kalaanu are Amurti (formless). In this way,
this verse describes the special names of the five Astikayas, their existence,
and their Kayapana. This Sutra should be understood to mean that only one pure
Jeeva Astikaya is worthy of being accepted. ||4||  **Time Explanation Verse-5**
Here, the possibility of the existence of the five Astikayas and the possibility
of their having a body are explained.  Those who have a nature along with
qualities and various transformations, they are the Astikayas from which the
three worlds are born. ||5||  Indeed, the Astikayas have a nature, a self-
nature, and non-duality along with qualities and various transformations. The
special features of an object are different from its transformations, while
qualities are inherent in it. Therefore, even a single object that is dissolving
with one transformation and arising with another, and holding on to its inherent
quality, has existence characterized by destruction, creation, and permanence.
However, if there is complete duality with qualities and transformations, then
one will perish, another will appear, and another will hold on to permanence,
and everything will be in flux. Therefore, this is the explanation of the
possibility of proper existence. The possibility of having a body is explained
by itself.  Because the Jeeva, Pudgala, Dharma, Adharma, and Akasha are not non-
existent, their parts, which are called Pradesh (space), are also said to be
transformations due to their mutual difference. Their non-duality with these
transformations makes the existence of a body possible. Even a single atom,
which is without parts, has the power of having parts, so the existence of a
body is not refuted. This is not the intention - that the assumption of having
parts for those other than Pudgala, who are formless and indivisible, is wrong.
It is seen that even in the indivisible space, there is the assumption of
division as this is the space of the pot and this is the space outside the pot.
If there were no division there, then the space of the pot would be the same as
the space outside the pot. This is not desirable. Therefore, the existence of a
body, which is the same as having parts, is to be understood for all except
Kalaanu.  The fact that they are born in the form of the three worlds is also a
means of proving their Astikayatva. Thus, the three worlds, the upper, lower,
and middle worlds, are born with the three types of creation and permanence, and
they are the special nature of those worlds. Therefore, they prove the existence
of their fundamental elements along with the combination of qualities and
transformations. It is inferred that Dharma, Adharma, and Akasha have the
existence of having parts, which is the same as the transformation in the form
of the upper, lower, and middle worlds. Even the Jeevas...

26 The existence of the six substances and the five astikayas, as described in
the form of the division of the three worlds (upper, lower, and middle), is
inferred from the fact that they are always present in the state of filling the
worlds, due to their inherent power. Similarly, the existence of the pudgalas,
which have attained the form of the great skandhas, due to their transformation
in the form of the division of the three worlds, is also established by the fact
that they are capable of being combined with individual powers, and thus have
nine types of parts. ||5||

## Translation:  **Panchaastikaya Prabhrut**  27 (1) The three lokas (worlds) -
the upper, lower, and middle - are characterized by their production,
consumption, and sustenance, and they exist as the unique forms of these three
lokas. As they evolve, they demonstrate the existence of their fundamental
substances, along with their qualities and modifications.  (2) Furthermore, it
can be inferred that Dharma, Adharma, and Akasha - each of these substances -
undergo transformation as divisions of the three lokas (upper, lower, and
middle), resulting in their being constituted by parts, known as Kayatva.
Similarly, it can be inferred that each Jiva (living being) also undergoes
transformation as divisions of the three lokas (upper, lower, and middle),
resulting in their being constituted by parts, known as Kayatva, due to the
constant presence of the power of individual existence, which manifests as the
filling of the lokas.  Likewise, it can be inferred that Pudgala (matter) also
undergoes transformation as divisions of the three lokas (upper, lower, and
middle), resulting in their being constituted by parts, known as Kayatva, due to
the constant presence of the power of individual existence, which manifests as
the filling of the lokas.  Pudgala also undergoes transformation as divisions of

The description of the six substances and the five categories of existence, as
well as their nature, has been explained. How so? Because in the three worlds,
whatever substances are subject to origination, destruction, and modification,
they are said to have existence in the form of origination, destruction, and
modification. How so? Because it is said that existence is in the form of
origination, destruction, and modification. Therefore, due to the presence of
parts, the nature of being composed of parts, and the nature of having a
location, the nature of existence and the nature of body exist in the form of
the upper, lower, and middle parts, as the form of the three worlds, which are
the result of the transformation of the soul, matter, etc. This nature of
existence and the nature of body should be understood not only in the
aforementioned way, but also in this way. In this context, the nature of body of
the pure soul should be understood as the nature of infinite knowledge, etc.,
the nature of the perfected state, and the nature of countless locations. This
is the meaning. ||5||  Thus, the concise explanation of the five categories of
existence, up to the three verses, has been completed. This is the second stage.
**Hindi Meaning:**  Verse 5 of the Uthānika further clarifies how the existence
and body mentioned in the first verse are possible.  **General Meaning with
Anvaya:**  (Jesiṁ) Those five categories of existence (vivihehiṁ) with various
types of (guṇehiṁ pajjayehiṁ saha) qualities and states of being [asthi sahaao]
have the nature of existence (te) they [asthikāya] are categories of existence
(hoti) are. (Jehiṁ) By which (tiilukkāṁ) these three worlds (ṇippāṇṇāṁ) are
created.  **Specific Meaning:**  Here, the nature of existence is called
existence, its essence, or its form. They exist with various types of qualities
and states of being. Thus, the existence of all five categories has been stated.
This is a commentary. Anvayi qualities are those that are inherent, and
vyatireka states of being are those that are distinct. Alternatively, those that
exist along with the substance are called qualities, and those that exist in a
separate sequence are called states of being. These qualities and states of
being, while differing in terms of name, characteristics, number, purpose, etc.,
in relation to their substance, are not different in terms of location or
existence; they are non-dual. These qualities and states of being are of various
types, such as inherent qualities, manifested qualities, or inherent states of
being, manifested states of being, and states of being related to meaning and
states of being related to expression.  In relation to the soul, it is said that
omniscience, etc., are the inherent qualities of the soul, and knowledge, etc.,
are the manifested qualities of the soul. The perfected state is the inherent
state of being. The forms of humans, hell beings, etc., are the manifested
states of being. In relation to matter, it is said that the color, etc., in pure
(unbound) atoms are the inherent qualities, and the color, etc., in the
aggregates formed by two atoms are the manifested qualities. The state of being
in the form of pure atoms is the inherent state of being of the substance. The
transformation of pure atoms from one color, etc., to another color, etc., is
the manifested quality state of being. The transformation of atoms into
aggregates of two atoms, etc., is the...

The five Astikayas, beginning with the Prabhrit Vibhav, are categories of
Dravya. The transformation of these categories, from the atomic level to the
level of color and other characteristics, is the Vibhav Guna category. These are
considered the special qualities of the Jiva and Pudgala. The general qualities
are existence, reality, knowability, non-heaviness, etc., which are found in all
Dravyas. The special qualities and categories of Dharma and other Dravyas will
be discussed later. The five Astikayas exist with these qualities and
categories, and thus they are in the form of existence. Now, we discuss
Kayapana. Anything that is similar to a body is called Kay, meaning a collection
of many regions. The three Lokas are created by these five Astikayas. Any
substance in the three Lokas that is produced, consumed, or has a form is
indicative of the existence of the Astikayas in the form of production,
consumption, and form. This is because the Sutra states, "Utpada Vyaya Dhrauvya
Rupa Sat." The Jiva, Pudgala, and other Dravyas are filled in the three Lokas
and are responsible for the shape and transformation of the three Lokas. There
are three types of Nelaad, Ma, and Bayo. The Jiva, Pudgala, and other five
Dravyas have components, parts, or regions. Therefore, Kayapana should be
understood in this way, not just as previously mentioned. Time Dravya is one
region, so it does not have Kayapana. In this way, existence and Kayatva should
be understood. The existence of the infinite knowledge and other qualities of
the pure Jiva Astikaya, the existence of its Siddha category, and its Kayapana
in the form of countless regions should be understood. ||5||  In this way, the
second section is complete, explaining the five Astikayas in three verses.
||3-4-5||  **Verse 6: Explanation of Time**  Here, the Dravya nature of the five
Astikayas and Time is stated. These Astikayas are eternal, having undergone
transformation in the past, present, and future. They are connected to the
Dravya state, along with the sign of transformation. ||6||  These Astikayas are
eternal, having undergone transformation in the past, present, and future. ||6||
They are connected to the Dravya state, along with the sign of transformation.
||6||  Dravyas are the foundation for the non-separate qualities and categories
of the universe. Therefore, because the past, present, and future states of the
Astikayas have undergone transformation in their nature, there is a Dravya
nature to the Astikayas, the sign of transformation, and Time. They are not
impermanent because they are undergoing transformation in the past, present, and
future states, as they are eternal due to their unchanging nature. Here, Time is
called the sign of transformation because it is the cause of the transformation
of Pudgala and other Dravyas, and because it is the category that is understood
through the transformation of Pudgala and other Dravyas, and because it is
included within the Astikayas. ||6||

## Chapter 30: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  **Hindi
Commentary, Verse 6: Meaning**  (Those who are transformed into states of the
three times) Those who are transformed into states of the past, present, and
future, and (are eternal) are eternal, (they are the Astikayas) these are the
Astikayas, (combined with the changing mark) combined with the changing mark
(time), they attain suppression (i.e., they are the six substances).
**Commentary:**  Here, the five Astikayas and time are described as substances.
Substances are fundamentally the basis of co-existing qualities and sequentially
existing states. Therefore, the five Astikayas and the changing mark time are
substances because they are transformed into states of the past, present, and
future.  They are not impermanent because they are transformed into states of
the past, present, and future, as they do not abandon their own definite form in
these states. Therefore, they are eternal.  Here, time is called the "changing
mark" because it is the cause of the change in the Pudgala, etc., and its states
are known through the change in the Pudgala, etc.  **Sanskrit Commentary, Verse
6:**  Now, the author describes time and the five Astikayas as substances.
"They are the Astikayas, transformed into states of the three times, and
eternal." These five Astikayas, although transformed into states of the three
times, are momentary, impermanent, and perishable according to the conventional
view. However, they are eternal according to the substantial view. Thus, they
are both eternal and impermanent according to the substantial and conventional
views. They attain the "state of substance" (i.e., they are recognized as
substances).  Again, what are they like? "Combined with the changing mark." The
change itself, the transformation of the Jiva, Pudgala, etc., is the mark, the
sign, the cause, the indicator, the indication, of which it is. This is the
changing mark, the time atom, the substantial time. They are combined with it.
Now, it should be said that they are combined with the substantial time. Why is
it said that they are combined with the changing mark? It is not so. In the
context of the five Astikayas, time is not the main thing. It is known as the
mark of the action, as the form of the new and old states of the objects.
Therefore, it is called the changing mark.  Here, among the six substances, the
pure Jiva Astikaya, which is free from all thoughts and doubts arising from the
perception of objects, such as food, fear, sex, and possession, and is filled
with the three jewels of faith, knowledge, and conduct, is the object of
attainment. It is attainable through the knowledge of self-awareness, which is
the form of supreme bliss, innate, and prior, arising from the state of non-
dualistic samadhi. This is the meaning.  Thus, the verse describes the five
Astikayas, along with time, as substances.

(These are) the five Astikayas mentioned above (Astikaya) which are the
transformations of the five substances (Pariyattanalinga-sanjukta) with the sign
of transformation, which (Tekaliyabhavaparinda) transform into three-time
related synonyms with time, and (Niccha) remain imperishable (Daviyabhavan) in
their substance (Gachchanti) are attained.  **Special Meaning:** According to
the Paryayarthika Naya, these five Astikayas mentioned above are transformed by
the three-time synonyms, and are momentary, impermanent, and perishable.
However, according to the Dravyarthika Naya, they are eternal. Thus, they are
Nistanayamika from the Dravyarthika and Paryayarthika perspectives. Just as
smoke is a sign of fire, similarly, the transformation or change of the Jiva,
Pudgala, etc. substances is the sign, Gamak, Gnyak, and indicator of the Kala
Dravya. That is, any cause that is the cause of the change of substances is the
transformation sign, Kalana, or Drashyakala.  Here, someone may doubt why it is
not said "Kaladravyasanjukta" but rather "Parivartanalingsanjukta" which is an
unclear statement. The solution is that Kala is not the main focus in the
context of the five Astikayas. Because the old and new nature of substances
occurs, Kala is known through this transformation-like work sign. Therefore, it
is said "Parivartanalinga" to inform about this.  Among these six substances,
the pure Jiva Astikaya, which is free from the thoughts and doubts arising from
the desire-like dependence on all other substances, such as seeing, hearing,
experiencing, eating, fear, sexual intercourse, and possession, is the one that
is worthy of being grasped and experienced. It is the Jiva Dravya that is
obtained within one's own body through pure conviction, which is full of the
pure, eternal, and effortless supreme bliss that arises from the Samadhi or
equanimity, which is free from doubts, and which is the three-jewel-like, non-
dual, Shraddha, Gnyan, and Acharan.  Thus, the verse is complete by stating that
the five Astikayas, including Kala, are called Dravyas.  **Uttanika:** Further,
it is said that these six substances, while being in close contact with each
other, do not fall from their own nature.  **Samayavyakhya Gatha-7:** Here, it
is said that even though the six substances are in close contact with each
other, they do not deviate from their own nature.

Jain Terms Preserved:  The six substances (षड्द्रव्य) - the five astikāyas
(पंचास्तिकाय) - enter into one another, giving space (अवकाश) to one another.
Though they are always (नित्यं) united, they do not abandon (न विजहन्ति) their
own (स्वकं) nature (स्वभावं).  The commentary explains that even though the six
substances are extremely intermingled, they do not deviate from their respective
definite natures. Therefore, it was said earlier (in the 6th verse) that they
are eternal (नित्य) despite being transformable (परिणामवत्त्वे). And therefore,
they do not attain oneness (एकत्वापत्ति), and even though the soul (जीव) and
karma are spoken of as one from the perspective of the practical viewpoint
(व्यवहारनय), they do not accept each other's nature.

The meaning is that the pure soul substance, known as the *Shuddha Jiva
Astikaya*, within one's own body, is the only thing that is worthy of being
attained, starting from the five *Astikayas* and ending with the *Nischayana*.
However, the meditation practices of other extreme proponents, which involve
holding the breath, achieving a state of complete emptiness, or practicing
*Akasa Dhyana* (meditation on space), all of which are accompanied by
attachment, aversion, and delusion, are all meaningless.  The difference between
*Sankalpa* and *Vikalpa* is explained as follows: *Sankalpa* is the
transformation that arises in the external object, which is a mixture of
consciousness and non-consciousness, such as the thought "This is mine."
*Vikalpa* is the transformation that arises within, such as the feeling of
happiness or sorrow, like "I am happy" or "I am sad." This is the definition of
*Sankalpa* and *Vikalpa*.  It is said that the qualifier "free from attachment"
is meaningless in the state of *Vitaraaga Nirvikalpa Samadhi* (meditation free
from attachment and mental fluctuations). To address this, it is explained that
the qualifier "free from attachment" is necessary to avoid the practice of
*Ashubha Dhyana* (meditation on inauspicious things), which is caused by the
*Kashaya* (negative emotions) related to anger and cruelty. It is also necessary
because it explains the relationship between cause and effect, because it is a
*Karmadharaya* compound, because it avoids repetition, because it is a qualifier
of the essence, and because it strengthens the understanding. This should be
understood throughout the explanation of *Vitaraaga Nirvikalpa Samadhi*.
Similarly, when explaining terms like *Vitaraaga*, *Sarvajña* (omniscient),
*Nirdosha* (free from faults), and *Parmatma* (Supreme Soul), the same approach
should be taken to address any objections that may arise.  The meaning of the
phrase "cause and effect" is that because of the cause, *Vitaraaga* (freedom
from attachment), there is the effect, *Nirvikalpa Samadhi* (meditation free
from mental fluctuations). || 7 ||  By avoiding the faults of *Sankara*
(mixture) and *Vyatikrama* (contradiction), the *Gatha* (verse) has reached the
third stage, and with these two independent *Gathas*, the third stage has been
reached. Thus, the first *Maha Adhikara* (major chapter) is complete with seven
*Gathas* and three stages, establishing the meaning of the word *Samaya* (time)
and the introduction to the *Peethika* (preface).  The first *Antara Adhikara*
(minor chapter) is complete.  Now, starting with the *Gatha* "**Ath Satta
Sanchapayattha**," the *Peethika* (preface) on general substances is explained
in fourteen *Gathas*, excluding the substances like *Jiva* (soul) and *Pudgala*
(matter).  Within these fourteen *Gathas*, the first *Gatha* "**Satta
Savvapayattha**" explains the characteristics of general and specific existence.
The second *Gatha* "**Daviyadi**" explains the non-difference between existence
and substance, and the etymology of the word *Dravya* (substance). The third
*Gatha* "**Dhavva Salakkhaniiyam**" explains the three characteristics of
substance. The fourth *Gatha* "**Uppatti Vi Naaso**" explains the two
characteristics of substance. The fifth and sixth *Gathas* "**Pajjayarahiayam**"
explain the third characteristic of substance.  Thus, with these three *Gathas*,
the fourth stage is reached, primarily focusing on the justification of the
*Dravya Arthic* (substance-based) and *Paryaya Arthic* (category-based)
perspectives, and their mutual relationship.  The fifth stage, with the *Gatha*
"**Siyaatthi**," primarily focuses on refuting all extreme views and explaining
the seven types of evidence.  Thus, with these five stages within the fourteen
*Gathas*, the first seven *Gathas* are complete.  The second set of seven
*Gathas* begins with the *Gatha* "**Bhavasa Natthi Naaso**," which primarily
focuses on establishing the existence of substance by refuting the extreme views
of Buddhism. This is followed by four *Gathas* that explain this *Gatha*. Within
these four *Gathas*, the *Gatha* "**Bhaava Jivaadia**" primarily explains the
substance and its categories. The *Gatha* "**Manuaattana**" explains that even
though the categories like humans are subject to destruction and creation, they
are still permanent and do not cease to exist. The *Gatha* "**So Cheva**"
further strengthens this point. The *Gatha* "**Evam Sado Vinaaso**" concludes
the explanation by stating that according to the *Dravya Arthic* perspective,
destruction and creation do not occur for the real, while according to the
*Paryaya Arthic* perspective, they occur through rebirth. Thus, these four
*Gathas* together constitute the second stage.  The third stage, with the
*Gatha* "**Naanavarandia**," primarily focuses on the creation of the unreal
from the real, according to the *Paryaya Arthic* perspective.  The fourth stage,
with the *Gatha* "**Evam Bhavam**," primarily focuses on explaining the creation
and destruction of the categories like godhood for the soul in the cycle of
existence, even though the soul is eternal in its substance, according to the
*Paryaya Arthic* perspective. This concludes the *Dravya Peethika* (preface on
substance).

The **Six Substances and Five Astikayas** chapter, along with other chapters,
completes the second set of seven chapters. Thus, with fourteen chapters and
other sections, the **Dravya Peethika** (Substance Foundation) is complete.
The text explains the nature of existence. It begins by defining the essence of
existence and then proceeds to explain the substances. The text states that the
essence of existence is **Bhaantva** (beingness) and then explains the
substances.  **Verse 7** (with commentary)  **Anvaya** (Word Order):  **Anno
Upanam Pavisantam** (entering another field) **Annam Annas** (one another)
**Ogasan** (giving space) **Niccam Milantam Vi Ya** (always meeting) **Sag
Sambhav** (with their own nature) **Pa Vijahanti** (do not abandon).  **General
Meaning:** When entering another field, they (the six substances) give space to
one another, always meeting, yet they do not abandon their own nature.
**Specific Meaning:** The six substances give space to each other and remain in
their own state until their time. However, there is no mixing or interference
between them. Mixing is when two substances become one, and interference is when
one substance enters another, like the qualities of a **Jiva** (soul) entering
**Pudgala** (matter).  The phrase "entering one another" refers to the movement
of **Jivas** and **Pudgalas**, which are active substances. The phrase "giving
space" refers to the interaction of active substances like **Jivas** and
**Pudgalas** with inactive substances like **Dharma** (merit), **Adharma**
(demerit), **Akasha** (space), and **Kala** (time). The phrase "always meeting"
refers to the constant interaction of inactive substances like **Dharma**,
**Adharma**, **Akasha**, and **Kala**.  The text then discusses the **Six
Substances** and their interactions. It mentions the three **Ashubha Leshya**
(inauspicious colors) - **Krishna** (black), **Neela** (blue), and **Kapota**
(grey) - which are perceived through the senses and are associated with the
**Six Substances**. These colors are the result of the **Sankalpa-Vikalpa**
(thought-waves) arising from the interaction of the **Six Substances**. The text
then describes the **Param Anand** (supreme bliss) that arises from **Vitaraga
Nirvikalpa Samadhi** (a state of complete detachment and non-dualistic
meditation). This bliss is the result of the **Shuddha Dravya Arthika Nay**
(pure substance-based logic) and is the **Shuddha Jiva Astikaya** (pure soul-
body).  The text then criticizes the **Ekantvadi** (isolationists) who practice
**Shunya Dhyana** (meditation on emptiness) or **Akasha Dhyana** (meditation on
space). These practices are considered futile because they are based on **Raga**
(attachment), **Dvesha** (aversion), and **Moha** (delusion).  The text then
explains the difference between **Sankalpa** and **Vikalpa**. **Sankalpa** is
the thought that "this is mine," which arises from the interaction of the
external world with the **Jiva**. **Vikalpa** is the thought that "I am happy or
unhappy," which arises from the internal state of the **Jiva**.

One should know the characteristics of sankalpa-vikalpaka, which are like the
five astikayas. Here, if someone says that the epithet "vitraga" is meaningless
in "vitraga nirvikalpa samadhi," then we provide the following solution: the
epithet "vitraga" is not meaningless for the following reasons. Firstly, it
indicates that the subject matter of the "art" or "raudradhyana" type, which are
inauspicious meditations due to the kshayas, is prohibited here. Secondly, it
states the cause and the effect of the cause. Thirdly, it is a karmadharaya
compound. Fourthly, it does not count as a repetition fault in the "bhavana"
text. Fifthly, it is an epithet of the form. Sixthly, it is intended to
strengthen. Wherever there is an explanation of "vitraga nirvikalpa samadhi,"
one should know this meaning in all places. If words like "vitraga sarvajña
nirdosha paramatma" are used in the same way, and someone raises a similar
objection, then it is appropriate to resolve it in the same way. The meaning of
"hetuhetumad bhaava" is that the same reason that makes one "vitraga" is also
the reason for "nirvikalpa samadhi."  In this way, the "sankara vyatikar" fault
is removed, and the gatha is complete. In this way, the third sthala is complete
with two independent gathas. In this way, the first mahaadhikār is complete with
seven gathas and three sthalas, which constitute the preface to the meaning of
the word "samaya."  Further, starting with the gatha "satta savvapyattha," and
continuing up to fourteen gathas, a preface to the general dravya is given,
without discussing the specific dravyas like jiva, pudgala, etc. In these
fourteen gathas, the characteristics of general and specific sattva are
explained. The gatha sutra in the first sthala is "satta savyapyatha," etc.
Then, the non-duality of sattva and dravya, and the importance of the word
"dravya" are explained in the second sthala with the sutra "daviyadi," etc.
Then, the three characteristics of dravya are explained in the third sthala with
the sutra "davvam sallakhaniyam," etc. Then, two characteristics are explained
with the sutra "uppattiya vinaso," etc. Then, the third characteristic is
explained with the gathas "pajjaya rahiya," etc. In this way, the fourth sthala
is constituted by three gathas, which are a collection of dravya-arthic,
paryayarthic, and mutually dependent, and which support both nayas. In the fifth
sthala, the sutra "siya atthi," etc. is used to explain the seven-fold negation,
which is the main proof for refuting all one-sided views. In this way, the first
seven gathas are constituted by five sthalas in fourteen gathas. Then, in the
second set of seven gathas, the first sthala is constituted by the gatha sutra
"bhavasa natthi naso," etc., which is used to refute the one-sided view of
Buddhism and establish the dravya. Then, there are four gathas to elaborate on
this. In these four gathas, the gatha sutra of the same adhikār is used to
explain the dravya-guna-paryaya, with the sutra "bhaava jivaadiya," etc.

The "Shaddravya-Panchaastikaya-Varnana Sutra" is one. Then, there is another
Sutra, "Manuanatena", which states that even though there is destruction and
birth in the cycle of human beings and other beings, there is no destruction in
terms of the eternal. Then, to further solidify this, there is another Sutra,
"So Cheva". In this way, according to the Dravyarthika Naya, there is no
destruction of the real and no creation of the unreal, but according to the
Paryayarthika Naya, there is. In this way, the concluding verse, "Javan Sado
Vinaso", etc., summarizes the explanation of these two Nayas. In this way, there
are four verses in the second section. Then, in the third section, there is one
Sutra, "Nanavaranadya", which emphasizes that according to the Paryayarthika
Naya, there is creation of the unreal for the Siddhas. Further, in the fourth
section, there is one verse, "Evam Bhavam", etc., which summarizes the
explanation that even though the Dravya is eternal, according to the
Paryayarthika Naya, the birth and death of the worldly beings, such as becoming
a god, are due to the actions of the being. This verse also marks the end of the
section on Dravya. In this way, there are seven sections in the second part,
which consists of four sections. Thus, the explanation of Dravya is complete
with fourteen verses and nine sections. This is described in the following
verse:  **Time Explanation Verse 8:**  "Atratisthvasvarupamuktam. Sattaa Savva-
Payattha Saviss-Ruuva Anant-Pajjayaa. Bhanguppaada-Dhuvattaa Sappaddivakkha
Havdi Ekkaa."  **Translation:**  "The essence of existence is explained here.
Existence is all-pervading, with infinite forms and infinite transformations. It
is characterized by destruction, creation, and permanence, and it is one with
its opposite."  **Explanation:**  "Existence, also known as Sattaa, is the state
of being. It is not something that is eternally constant or completely
momentary. A truly eternal thing cannot have transformations, as there would be
no change in its state. A truly momentary thing cannot have continuity, as there
would be no way to recognize it. Therefore, existence is something that is
characterized by permanence, based on a certain form, and it is constantly
changing and being created, with two forms, one of which is disappearing and the
other is appearing. It is simultaneously experiencing all states of existence in
reality. Therefore, existence is also characterized by creation, destruction,
and permanence, as it is the same as the state of being and non-being. It is
one, as it is the indicator of the similarity of all other things. It is present
in all things, as the concept of "Sat" (existence) is found in all things. It is
all-encompassing, as it exists with all the forms and characteristics of the
universe. It is infinite in its transformations, as it is understood through
infinite transformations of Dravya. Even though it is like this, it is not
uncontrolled."

The five characteristics, beginning with the characteristic of being subject to
origination, destruction, and permanence, are all characterized by having an
opposite. The opposite of existence is non-existence, the opposite of the three
characteristics is the absence of the three characteristics, the opposite of the
one is the many, the opposite of being present in all substances is being
present in one substance, the opposite of being of one form is being of many
forms, and the opposite of being of one category is being of infinite
categories. There are two types of existence: the great existence and the
limited existence. The great existence is the indicator of the existence of
similarity that pervades all substances. The limited existence is the indicator
of the existence of the form that is limited to a specific substance. Thus, the
great existence is non-existence in the form of limited existence, and the
limited existence is non-existence in the form of great existence. Therefore,
non-existence is existence. The characteristic of origination is the
characteristic of being one, the characteristic of destruction is the
characteristic of being one, and the characteristic of permanence is the
characteristic of being one. Therefore, the absence of the three characteristics
in the forms of things that are originating, being destroyed, and remaining is
the absence of the three characteristics in the three characteristics. The
existence of the form of one thing is not the existence of the form of another
thing, therefore the one is many. The existence of things is limited to specific
substances, therefore the existence of all substances is the existence of one
substance. The existence of things is limited to specific forms, therefore the
existence of many forms is the existence of one form. The existence of things is
limited to specific categories, therefore the existence of infinite categories
is the existence of one category. All this is due to the fact that the
explanation of the characteristics of the general and the specific is dependent
on the two-fold nature of the explanation.

## 38 ## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  The attainment of
knowledge of 'being' (sat) is like the attainment of knowledge of 'thatness'.
And that (being) is 'all-world-formed' because it exists with all world-forms,
i.e., with the unique natures of all the expanse of things. And that (being) is
'infinite-category-formed' because it is pervaded by infinite categories of
substances with three characteristics. (Thus, the description of general-
particular being has been given in relation to its general aspect, i.e., in
relation to the form of great being.)  Even though it is like this, it is not
truly unopposed but is opposed. (1) Being is opposed by non-being, (2) the three
characteristics are opposed by the non-three-characteristic nature, (3) the one
is opposed by the many, (4) the all-substance-located is opposed by the one-
substance-located nature, (5) the all-world-formed is opposed by the one-formed
nature, (6) the infinite-category-formed is opposed by the one-category-formed
nature.  (The above-mentioned opposed nature is explained clearly:-) Being is of
two types - great being and intermediate being. Among them, the great being
(general being), which indicates the existence of similarity in the group of all
substances, has already been mentioned. The other is the intermediate being
(particular being), which indicates the nature-existence in a definite (one-one
definite) thing. (9) There, great being is non-being in the form of intermediate
being, and intermediate being is non-being in the form of great being, therefore
being is non-being (i.e., the general-particular being, being 'being' due to
being in the form of great being, is also 'non-being' due to being in the form
of intermediate being). (2) The production of that (that nature) in that way is
one characteristic, the destruction of that (that nature) in that way is one
characteristic, and the permanence of that (that nature) in that way is one
characteristic, therefore each of the natures of a thing that is produced,
destroyed, and permanent is devoid of the three characteristics, therefore the
three-characteristic (being) is non-characteristic (i.e., the general-particular
being, being 'three-characteristic' due to being in the form of great being, is
also 'non-three-characteristic' due to being in the form of intermediate being
mentioned here). (3) The nature-being of one thing is not the nature-being of
another thing, therefore the one (being) is many (i.e., the general-particular
being, being 'one' due to being in the form of great being, is also 'many' due
to being in the form of intermediate being mentioned here). (4) The definiteness
(different definite individuality) of substances is due to the beings located in
definite (individual definite) substances, therefore the all-substance-located
(being) is one-substance-located (i.e., the general-particular being, being
'all-substance-located' due to being in the form of great being, is also 'one-
substance-located' due to being in the form of intermediate being mentioned
here). (5) The definite one-one form of things is due to the beings with
definite one-one forms, therefore the all-world-formed (being) is one-formed
(i.e., the general-particular being, being 'all-world-formed' due to being in
the form of great being, is also 'one-formed' due to being in the form of
intermediate being mentioned here).

"The five-fold characteristics, beginning with 'pribhrit', are also 'ekarupa'.
(5) The infinity of each category is determined by the (individual, different)
entities existing in each category, therefore the infinite-category-possessing
(entity) is also one-category-possessing (i.e., the general-specific-most
entity, being the form of the great entity, is 'infinite-category-possessing',
while the same entity, being the form of the intermediate entity, is also 'one-
category-possessing'). Thus, everything is nirvan (i.e., the above-mentioned
all-encompassing form is flawless, unobstructed, and free from any
contradiction), because its (the form of the entity) statement is subject to two
nayas, leaning towards the representation of the general and the specific." (8)

## Chapter 40: Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  This
chapter will discuss the six substances and five astikayas, which are:  *
**Diverse in form:** They possess numerous forms. * **Infinite in
permutations:** They have infinite permutations. * **Subject to production,
destruction, and permanence:** They are characterized by production,
destruction, and permanence. * **One:** They are one, meaning they are one in
relation to the Maha-satta (supreme reality). * **With their opposites:** They
exist along with their opposites.  **Explanation:**  The reality, which is
characterized by five specific qualities, possesses its opposite aspects. This
means that the reality, which is considered one in relation to the four
categories of substance (dravya, guna, karma, and dharma), has its opposite in
the form of non-existence in relation to the four categories of substance.  The
Maha-satta, which resides in all substances, has its opposite in the form of the
Avanta-satta (subordinate reality), which resides in a single substance. The
Maha-satta manifests in various forms, such as a pot made of clay, a pot made of
gold, a pot made of copper, etc. Its opposite is the Avanta-satta, which is the
form of a single pot.  Alternatively, the reality, which exists in a single pot
in the form of various qualities like color, smell, taste, touch, etc., has its
opposite in the form of a specific quality like smell.  The Maha-satta, which is
infinite in permutations in relation to the three times (past, present, and
future), has its opposite in the form of the reality of a specific permutation.
The reality, which is characterized by three qualities (production, destruction,
and permanence), has its opposite in the form of the reality of a specific
production, destruction, or permanence.  The Maha-satta has its opposite in the
form of the Avanta-satta.  Therefore, from the perspective of the pure Sangraha-
naya (doctrine of collection), there is one Maha-satta. From the perspective of
the impure Sangraha-naya or the Vyavahara-naya (doctrine of practical
application), there is the Avanta-satta, which exists in all substances in
various forms.  This explanation of the opposites should be understood from the
perspective of the Naigama-naya (doctrine of negation).  Therefore, the
explanation of reality should be understood through the three doctrines of
Sangraha, Vyavahara, and Naigama.  Alternatively, it is appropriate to explain
reality through two doctrines: the pure Sangraha-naya, which states that there
is one Maha-satta, and the Vyavahara-naya, which states that there is the
Avanta-satta, which exists in all substances.  Here, the pure reality of the
pure Jiva-astikaya (soul-reality) is the object of knowledge or the reality that
should be grasped.  **Time Explanation:**  Here, the difference in meaning
between reality and substance is rejected.  "That which flows, moves, and
pervades those permutations of existence, that is substance. They say that
substance is non-different from reality."  Substance is explained as that which
flows, moves, and pervades those permutations of existence, which are the
permutations of existence that are both sequential and simultaneous, in
accordance with the specific nature of reality. Substance is the object of
knowledge and its characteristics...

It is to be understood that although there may be some difference between the
five characteristics and the other aspects of existence, in reality, they are
not separate from existence. Therefore, whatever was previously stated about
existence, such as its being, non-being, distinctness, non-distinctness,
oneness, multiplicity, being present in all substances, being present in one
substance, being the form of the universe, being of one form, having infinite
synonyms, and having one synonym, should all be considered as belonging to the
substance that follows it. Therefore, there is no specific characteristic of
existence that would establish existence as truly separate from substance.

The meaning of the sutra is that since the six substances and the five
categories of existence are inseparable, the substance itself should be
considered. ||9|| Thus, in the second place, the verse has been stated to remove
the doubt regarding the non-difference of substance and existence, the word
"substance", and its etymology. Hindi meaning commentary verse-9 General
meaning-(That) which (Tai Tai) its own (Swabhavpjjaayi) nature-like synonyms
(Daviyadi) absorbs (Gachchadi) obtains (Tan) that (Daviyam) substance (Bhapante)
is called (Tu) but that substance (Sattado) from existence (Ananabhudam) is
inseparable. Specific meaning-That which has undergone transformation in the
past, is undergoing transformation in the present, and will undergo
transformation in the future, is called substance. With respect to the synonyms
of nature, it is said to be "Dravati" and with respect to the synonyms of
"Vibhav", it is said to be "Gachchati". This substance is undoubtedly one with
its existence, because even though there is a difference between existence and
substance with respect to designation, number, characteristics, purpose, etc.,
there is undoubtedly no difference between existence and substance. Therefore,
the characteristics of existence mentioned in the previous verse should also be
known as the characteristics of substance, which is inseparable from existence.
That is, in substance, there is the presence of all things, the presence of one
thing, the presence of all forms, the presence of one form, the presence of
infinite synonyms, the presence of one synonym, the presence of three
characteristics, the presence of one characteristic, the presence of one form,
the presence of many forms. ||9|| In this way, the verse is complete, stating
the non-difference of existence and substance and the etymology of the word
"substance" in the second place. Time explanation verse-1 Here, the
characteristics of substance are stated. "Davyam Sallakhanayam Uppaadabvaya-
Dhuvatta-Sanjuttam. Guna-Pajjaayasayam Va Jam Tan Bhannamti Savvanhu." ||10||
Substance is characterized by being produced, destroyed, and permanent. Or,
whatever is the basis of the synonyms of qualities, that is what the omniscient
ones call substance. ||10|| Characteristics of substance. Due to the non-
difference of the stated characteristics from existence, the characteristics of
substance are the same as the characteristics of existence. And, since substance
is multi-faceted, its essence is only existence, because there is no division of
object and characteristics. Or, the characteristics of substance are production,
destruction, and permanence. In a series of beings that are not contradictory in
nature and are sequential, the destruction of the previous being is...

The characteristics of a substance are: (1) **Sat** (existence), (2) **Utpada-
Vyaya-Dhrauvyam** (production, destruction, and permanence), and (3) **Guna-
Paryaya** (qualities and synonyms).  **Sat** is the characteristic of a
substance that is characterized by existence. It is the essence of a substance,
which is inseparable from its existence.  **Utpada-Vyaya-Dhrauvyam** is the
characteristic of a substance that is characterized by production, destruction,
and permanence. It is the process of change that a substance undergoes, where
the previous state is destroyed and a new state is produced. This process is
continuous and inherent to the substance.  **Guna-Paryaya** is the
characteristic of a substance that is characterized by qualities and synonyms.
These qualities and synonyms are inherent to the substance and are manifested in
different ways. They are both similar and different from the substance, and they
are constantly changing.  These three characteristics are interconnected and
inseparable. If one is present, the other two are also present. They all
describe the essence of a substance and its inherent nature.

## Six Substances - Description of the Five Astikayas  When one of these three
characteristics of a substance is stated, the other two are implied by meaning.
If a substance is real, then it will be (1) subject to production and
destruction, and (2) have qualities and transformations. If it is subject to
production and destruction, then it will be (1) real and (2) have qualities and
transformations. If it has qualities and transformations, then it will be (1)
real and (2) subject to production and destruction.   In this way, being real,
eternal and non-eternal in nature, it (1) manifests the characteristic of being
subject to production and destruction, and (2) shows unity with qualities that
are subject to production and destruction and transformations that are subject
to production and destruction.   The characteristic of being subject to
production and destruction (1) indicates the ultimate reality of being eternal
and non-eternal, and (2) reveals the qualities and transformations that are the
cause of its nature.   Qualities and transformations, being both inherent and
non-inherent, (1) indicate the characteristic of being subject to production and
destruction, and (2) reveal the ultimate reality of being eternal and non-
eternal. || 10 ||

45 General meaning with Anvaya of Panchastikaya: (j) That which is
(sallavakhanyam) of good characteristics, (uppaadavvyadhuvattasanjuttam) is
accompanied by production, destruction, and change, (va) or (gunapajjaayasayam)
is the basis of qualities and synonyms, (tam) that, i.e., the one with the
aforementioned three characteristics, (savanhnu) the omniscient Lord [davvam]
substance (bhananti) is called. Specific meaning: The characteristic of
substance is done by the sat-rupa dravyarthicnaya. This negates Buddhism which
considers all things as non-existent. The characteristic is done by the
paryayaarthicnaya as production, destruction, change, or qualities and synonyms.
This negates the Sankhya and Nyaya who believe in the eternal and unchanging. By
saying that the characteristic of existence is substance, the characteristics of
production, destruction, change, or qualities and synonyms are obtained by rule.
By characterizing as production, destruction, and change, the characteristic of
existence or qualities and synonyms are obtained by rule. By characterizing as
qualities and synonyms, the characteristic of production, destruction, change,
or existence is obtained by rule. How are the other two characteristics obtained
when one characteristic is stated? The answer is that there is mutual
inseparability in these three characteristics, i.e., they are all implicit in
each other. The meaning here is that pure jiva-dravya is upadaya, which has the
characteristic of pure existence, because it does not have mithyatva, raga,
dvesha, etc. The same, from the perspective of synonyms, has the characteristic
of pure production, destruction, and change due to the six qualities of aguru,
laghu, etc., which increase and decrease, and the characteristic of synonyms in
the form of infinite qualities like akrutrima jnana, etc., and inherent
happiness and perfect siddha. The pure jiva-astikaya is the one that possesses
these three characteristics. This explanation refutes the Buddhist view of
momentary monism, the Sankhya view of eternal monism, and the Nyaya and Mimamsa
view of both eternal and non-eternal monism. The same should be known at the
time of explaining other views everywhere. Why do we criticize the momentary
monism? The answer to this question is that the one who started the action of
creating a pot, etc., was destroyed at that very moment, then the action of the
pot could not be completed, etc. Similarly, in believing in eternal monism,
there is this flaw that the one who is sitting should remain sitting, the one
who is happy should remain happy, the one who is unhappy should remain unhappy,
etc. Since the eternally unchanging substance is engraved, there will be no
other synonyms in it. Similarly, by believing in the monism of both substance
and synonyms without mutual dependence, both the aforementioned flaws will be
obtained. In Jainism, by believing in the mutual dependence of substance and
synonyms, no flaw can arise. 10. In this way, the gatha is completed mainly by
the information that the characteristic of substance in the third sthala is of
three types: existence, etc.

## Chapter 46: Description of the Six Categories and Five Astikayas  **Verse
11:**  **Time Commentary:**  Neither the origin nor the destruction of a
substance exists, its existence is real. Its transformations bring about its
disappearance, origination, and permanence.  **Commentary:**  Here, the
characteristics of a substance are explained through both the substance-oriented
and transformation-oriented perspectives.  A substance, which is characterized
by the co-existence of qualities and the sequential transformations, and which
exists in all three times (past, present, and future), being eternal and without
beginning or end, cannot be subject to destruction or creation. However, some of
its transformations, which are co-existent, may be permanent, while others,
which are sequential, may be subject to destruction and creation. Therefore,
when considering a substance in its own right, it should be understood as being
without origination and destruction, and having an inherent nature of existence.
However, when considering it in terms of its transformations, it should be
understood as having origination and destruction.  All this is free from
contradiction because there is no difference between a substance and its
transformations.

8. They [the Jain scriptures] declare that the five Astikayas [categories of
existence] are the result of [the interaction of] the same [underlying]
substance, and they [the scriptures] make the production and destruction of that
substance permanent. Who are the agents [of this process]? The [different]
states [of existence]. What is being said by this? That according to the
Dravyarthika Nay [the perspective of substance], the production and destruction
of the substance itself do not occur, but according to the Paryayarthika Nay
[the perspective of states], they do. What is the example [of this]? In the case
of gold, milk, clay, a child, a young man, an adult, and an old man, there is a
threefold change [in their form], and by this, the previous statement [in the
scriptures] that the eternal and absolute [nature of the soul] is not negated is
confirmed. In this sutra, according to the pure Dravyarthika Nay, the pure Jiva
Astikaya, which is free from the production and destruction of the states of
existence like humans, hell beings, etc., is the object of study, because
according to the Paryayarthika Nay, it is possible to attain the state of
Vitaraga Nirvikalpa Samadhi [the state of complete detachment and equanimity],
which is characterized by the enjoyment of the inherent supreme bliss, and this
is the state of the pure Jiva substance, which is characterized by the knowledge
of self-awareness. 11. Thus, the sutra is explained by the two-fold explanation
of the Dravyarthika and Paryayarthika Nays.  Hindi, Tatparya Vritti, Gatha 11,
Uththānika: The first half of the Gatha explains the characteristics of
substance according to the Dravyarthika Nay, and the second half explains the
characteristics of states according to the Paryayarthika Nay.  Anvaya Sahait
Samaanyarth: The substance does not have birth or death, but its mere existence
is [always] present. The same states [of existence] cause the production,
destruction, and permanence [of the substance].  Vishesharth: The substance is
without beginning and end. According to the Dravyarthika Nay, there is no
production or destruction of the substance. It always remains in its own
existence. By saying this, the absolute view that the substance is momentary is
refuted. The production, destruction, and permanence of the states occur
according to the Paryayarthika Nay. There are many examples of this. For
example, gold is a substance. When earrings are made from it, the earrings are
produced, the previous state of the gold is destroyed, and the general qualities
of gold remain permanent. Milk is a substance. When cream is made from it, the
cream is produced, the thin milk is destroyed, and the general qualities of milk
remain permanent. Clay is a substance. When a pot is made from it, the previous
state of the pot is destroyed, and the clay remains permanent in all states. A
man is a person. He becomes a child, then a young man, then an adult, and then
an old man. When the next state is produced, the previous state is destroyed,
but the man remains permanent. By this, the absolute view that the soul is
eternal is confirmed. In this sutra, the pure Jiva substance, which is free from
the production and destruction of the states of existence like humans, hell
beings, etc., according to the pure Dravyarthika Nay, is the object of study,
because according to the Paryayarthika Nay, it is possible to attain the state
of Vitaraga Nirvikalpa Samadhi, which is characterized by the enjoyment of the
inherent supreme bliss, and this is the state of the pure Jiva substance, which
is characterized by the knowledge of self-awareness. This is the meaning of the
sutra.

## Verse 48: Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  This verse
concludes the explanation of the characteristics of substance, considering both
the Dravyarthic and Paryayarthic Nayas.  **Verse 12:**  * **Translation:**  "A
substance without its attributes does not exist, just as there is no milk
without its attributes like curd, butter, etc. Similarly, attributes without
their substance do not exist, just as there is no curd, butter, etc. without
milk. The Shramanas [Jain monks] declare that both are non-different in
essence."  * **Commentary:** This verse highlights the non-duality of substance
and its attributes. Just as milk cannot exist without its attributes like curd,
butter, etc., and vice versa, a substance cannot exist without its attributes,
and attributes cannot exist without their substance. Although there may be a
perceived difference due to different perspectives or purposes, their essential
nature is non-dual.  * **Hindi Commentary:**  The verse explains that a
substance without its attributes does not exist, and attributes without their
substance do not exist. The Shramanas declare that both are non-different in
essence.  * **Sanskrit Commentary:** This verse demonstrates the non-duality of
substance and its attributes. A substance without its attributes does not exist,
just as there is no milk without its attributes like curd, butter, etc.
Similarly, attributes without their substance do not exist, just as there is no
curd, butter, etc. without milk. Because of this non-duality, the Shramanas
declare that both substance and attributes are non-different in essence.

## The Second Discourse: The Non-Dual, Indivisible Nature of Substance and
Attributes  The Shramanas (Jain monks) elucidate the non-dual, indivisible
nature of substance and attributes, which is the essence of the matter. If one
asks how attributes can be called substances, then the answer is that attributes
are synonymous with substance, as it is said, "Attributes are the essence of
substance."   Here, the meaning is that the pure substance, known as the
"Shuddha Jiva Astikaya," is indivisible from the pure attributes, and it is the
object of pure knowledge.   In any sentence where the word "naya" (principle) is
not explicitly mentioned, it should be understood implicitly. This is similar to
how the presence of a verb implies the presence of a noun, or how the word
"syat" (perhaps) is understood even when not explicitly stated.   **Hindi
Commentary:**  This verse further explains that according to the "Nischya Naya"
(principle of certainty), substance and attributes are inseparable.   **Meaning
with Analysis:**  * **Substance without attributes, and attributes without
substance, do not exist.** The Shramanas say that both are non-dual,
indivisible, and constitute a single essence.   **Specific Meaning:**  * Just as
curd, milk, etc., cannot exist without the attribute of "goras" (milk),
similarly, substance cannot exist without attributes.  * Conversely, just as
"goras" cannot exist without curd, milk, etc., attributes cannot exist without
substance. Therefore, both are inseparable.   According to the "Abheda Naya"
(principle of non-duality), there is no difference between substance and
attributes. This is why the omniscient beings have declared that substance and
attributes are non-dual, indivisible, and exist as a single entity.
Alternatively, the first half of the verse can also be interpreted as saying
that the Shramanas declare that substance and attributes are a single entity,
which is the essence of all things. The word "bhava" (essence) is used to refer
to this entity. As it is said, "Bhava, which is synonymous with substance and
attributes, is the essence of all things."  Here, the meaning is that the pure
substance, known as the "Shuddha Jiva Astikaya," which is indivisible from the
pure attributes, is the object of pure knowledge.   The commentator states that
in any sentence where the word "naya" (principle) is not explicitly mentioned,
it should be understood implicitly. This is similar to how the presence of a
verb implies the presence of a noun, or how the word "syat" (perhaps) is
understood even when not explicitly stated.   **Commentary on the Next Verse:**
The next verse discusses the non-duality of substance and its qualities.

The translation preserving the Jain terms is as follows:  The description of the
Shaddravya (six substances) and Panchaastikaya (five cosmic bodies) is that
without Dravya (substance), Guna (attributes) do not exist, and without Guna,
Dravya does not exist. Therefore, the state of being inseparable (Avyatirikta
Bhava) exists for the Dravya and Guna.  The Pudgala (matter) is separate from
Sparsha (touch), Rasa (taste), Gandha (smell), and Varna (color), just as Guna
cannot exist without Dravya. And the Pudgala is not separate from Sparsha, Rasa,
Gandha, and Varna, just as Dravya cannot exist without Guna. Therefore, even
though there is some distinction in Dravya and Guna due to the difference in
their modes, they are non-different in essence, as they are fixed in existence,
interdependent, and have the same nature.

qualities (Davvam) substance (Na Sambhavdi) cannot exist. (Tamha) Therefore,
(Davvagunāṇam) substance and qualities are (Avvadiritto Bhavo) inseparable
[Havdi].**  **Specific Meaning - The commentator says, reducing it to the
substance, that just as touch, taste, smell, and color cannot be found in the
substance of pudgala without its existence, so too, qualities cannot exist
without substance. And just as the substance of pudgala cannot be found without
qualities like color, etc., so too, substance cannot be obtained without
qualities. The existence of substance and qualities is inseparable - one,
because they are inseparable with respect to substance. The regions of substance
and qualities are inseparable - one, because there is unity with respect to the
region. Substance and qualities have the same time of origin and destruction,
because both are one with respect to time. Substance and qualities are both of
the same nature, because their nature is one. Because substance and qualities
are inseparable with respect to substance, region, time, and states, therefore,
substance and qualities are inseparable - one. Or, another explanation is given,
that the state which is the object is inseparable from substance and qualities,
that is, the object is said to be the form of substance and qualities. The pure
substance of the soul, called the pure Jivastkay, which is free from the net of
choices of the states of attachment, etc., and is filled with the group of
qualities like pure knowledge, etc., is the one that is worthy of knowing or
obtaining, which is the knowledge of self-awareness, which is the form of
perception, attainment, and realization, which is the happiness of pure bliss,
which is born from the power of the state of non-dual meditation, is the one
that should be meditated upon with the mind, spoken of with words, and practiced
with the body, this is the meaning of this sutra. || 13 ||**  **In this way, two
verses are complete, which describe the characteristics of the categories of
qualities, and with the collection of three verses along with the previous
sutra, the fourth section is complete.**

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  **Verse 14 of the
Abhaya Commentary**  Here, the sevenfold predication is stated due to the nature
of the substance. It may be, it is not, it may be both, it may be inexpressible,
and again, the threefold predication. Indeed, the substance is capable of
sevenfold predication due to the nature of the predication.  **Explanation:**
1. The substance may be. 2. The substance may not be. 3. The substance may be
and may not be. 4. The substance may be inexpressible. 5. The substance may be
and may be inexpressible. 6. The substance may not be and may be inexpressible.
7. The substance may be, may not be, and may be inexpressible.  Here, the word
"may be" is a general term that indicates the possibility of something. It is
not a definitive statement. The substance is said to be "may be" when it is
perceived from the perspective of its own nature, its own field, its own time,
and its own state. The substance is said to be "may not be" when it is perceived
from the perspective of another's nature, another's field, another's time, and
another's state. The substance is said to be "may be and may not be" when it is
perceived from the perspective of both its own nature, its own field, its own
time, and its own state, and another's nature, another's field, another's time,
and another's state. The substance is said to be "may be inexpressible" when it
is perceived from the perspective of both its own nature, its own field, its own
time, and its own state, and another's nature, another's field, another's time,
and another's state, simultaneously. The substance is said to be "may be and may
be inexpressible" when it is perceived from the perspective of its own nature,
its own field, its own time, and its own state, simultaneously with another's
nature, another's field, another's time, and another's state. The substance is
said to be "may not be and may be inexpressible" when it is perceived from the
perspective of another's nature, another's field, another's time, and another's
state, simultaneously with another's nature, another's field, another's time,
and another's state. The substance is said to be "may be, may not be, and may be
inexpressible" when it is perceived from the perspective of its own nature, its
own field, its own time, and its own state, simultaneously with another's
nature, another's field, another's time, and another's state, and another's
nature, another's field, another's time, and another's state.  This is not
contradictory. Every object is non-empty due to its own nature, empty due to
another's nature, both non-empty and empty, capable of being expressed,
incapable of being expressed due to the combination of the predications,
incapable of being expressed, both non-empty and incapable of being expressed.

##  The Sevenfold Predicament (Saptabhangi)  **The term 'syāt' (perhaps) is used
as an indeclinable word in the sense of 'kathंचit' (in some way), which negates
the absolute affirmation and indicates anekanta (multi-facetedness).**  Here,
(1) when a substance is described in relation to its own substance, space, time,
and mode, it is 'asti' (is). (2) When a substance is described in relation to
another substance, space, time, and mode, it is 'nāsti' (is not). (3) When a
substance is described in relation to its own substance, space, time, and mode,
and then in relation to another substance, space, time, and mode, it is 'asti
and nāsti' (is and is not). (4) When a substance is described simultaneously in
relation to its own substance, space, time, and mode, and in relation to another
substance, space, time, and mode, it is 'avaktāvya' (unspeakable). (5) When a
substance is described in relation to its own substance, space, time, and mode,
and simultaneously in relation to its own and another substance, space, time,
and mode, it is 'asti and avaktāvya' (is and unspeakable). (6) When a substance
is described in relation to another substance, space, time, and mode, and
simultaneously in relation to its own and another substance, space, time, and
mode, it is 'nāsti and avaktāvya' (is not and unspeakable). (7) When a substance
is described in relation to its own substance, space, time, and mode, in
relation to another substance, space, time, and mode, and simultaneously in
relation to its own and another substance, space, time, and mode, it is 'asti,
nāsti, and avaktāvya' (is, is not, and unspeakable).  **This (above mentioned)
is not inappropriate, because all things (1) are 'ashunya' (non-empty) in
relation to their own nature, etc., (2) are 'shunya' (empty) in relation to
another nature, etc., (3) are 'ashunya and shunya' (non-empty and empty) in
relation to both (their own nature, etc., and another nature, etc.), (4) are
'avachya' (unspeakable) in relation to both (their own nature, etc., and another
nature, etc.) simultaneously, (5) are 'ashunya and avachya' (non-empty and
unspeakable) when described in relation to the combination of the predicaments,
(6) are 'shunya and avachya' (empty and unspeakable), (7) are 'ashunya, shunya,
and avachya' (non-empty, empty, and unspeakable).** ||14||  **Verse 14 of the
Sanskrit Tatparya Vritti**  Now, in order to refute all contradictions, the
sevenfold predicament of evidence is explained.  "From a statement of evidence
without contradiction, The conception of existence, etc., which is the sevenfold
predicament of truth, is considered to be true."  **Explanation:**  * **Siy
Asthi:**  'Syāt asti' (perhaps is) - meaning, in some way, in relation to its
own substance, space, time, and mode, it is 'asti' (is). * **Siy Natthi:** 'Syāt
nāsti' (perhaps is not) - meaning, in some way, in relation to another
substance, space, time, and mode, it is 'nāsti' (is not). * **Siy Asthi
Natthi:** 'Syāt asti nāsti' (perhaps is and is not) - meaning, in some way, in
relation to its own substance, space, time, and mode, and then in relation to
another substance, space, time, and mode, it is 'asti and nāsti' (is and is
not). * **Siy Avvattavya:** 'Syāt avaktāvya' (perhaps unspeakable) - meaning, in
some way, because it is impossible to speak simultaneously, as per the statement
'kram pravritti bharati' (the flow of the sequence), in relation to its own and
another substance, space, time, and mode, it is 'avaktāvya' (unspeakable). *
**Punovitti Tattidayam:** 'Syāt asti avvattavya' (perhaps is and unspeakable) -
meaning, in some way, in relation to its own substance, space, time, and mode,
and simultaneously in relation to its own and another substance, space, time,
and mode, it is 'asti and avaktāvya' (is and unspeakable). * **Siy Natthi
Avvattavya:** 'Syāt nāsti avvattavya' (perhaps is not and unspeakable) -
meaning, in some way, in relation to another substance, space, time, and mode,
and simultaneously in relation to its own and another substance, space, time,
and mode, it is 'nāsti and avaktāvya' (is not and unspeakable). * **Siy Asthi
Natthi Avvattavya:** 'Syāt asti nāsti avvattavya' (perhaps is, is not, and
unspeakable) - meaning, in some way, in relation to its own substance, space,
time, and mode, in relation to another substance, space, time, and mode, and
simultaneously in relation to its own and another substance, space, time, and
mode, it is 'asti, nāsti, and avaktāvya' (is, is not, and unspeakable).
**Sanbhavati:** (It is possible) **Kim Kartr:** (What is the agent?) **Davyam:**
(Substance) **Khub Spuṭam:** (Clearly) **Kathambhūtam:** (How is it?) **Satta
Bhang:** (Sevenfold Predicament) **Kena:** (By what?) **Ādesavaseṇ:** (By the
question and answer)

## Explanation of the Five Categories of Substance and the Seven-fold
Predicament  This section explains the seven-fold predicament (Saptabhangi) in
relation to the five categories of substance (Dravyapanchaastika).   **The
Seven-fold Predicament:**  The seven-fold predicament arises from the seven
possible ways of predicating something:  1. **Syat Asti (May Be):** It may be.
2. **Syat Nasti (May Not Be):** It may not be. 3. **Syat Asti Nasti (May Be and
May Not Be):** It may be and may not be. 4. **Syat Avaktavya (May Be
Indeterminate):** It may be indeterminate. 5. **Syat Asti Avaktavya (May Be and
May Be Indeterminate):** It may be and may be indeterminate. 6. **Syat Nasti
Avaktavya (May Not Be and May Be Indeterminate):** It may not be and may be
indeterminate. 7. **Syat Asti Nasti Avaktavya (May Be, May Not Be, and May Be
Indeterminate):** It may be, may not be, and may be indeterminate.  **How a
Single Substance Can Be Subject to the Seven-fold Predicament:**  Just as a
single person, Devadatta, can be described in many ways depending on the context
(e.g., son, father, nephew, uncle, husband, brother, enemy, friend), so too can
a single substance be described in seven ways depending on the perspective.
**Detailed Explanation:**  The seven-fold predicament can be applied to each of
the seven categories of substance (existence, non-existence, both,
indeterminate, existence and indeterminate, non-existence and indeterminate,
existence, non-existence, and indeterminate).  **Example:**  Devadatta can be:
1. **Syat Putra (May Be a Son):** He may be a son. 2. **Syat Aputra (May Not Be
a Son):** He may not be a son. 3. **Syat Putra Aputra (May Be a Son and May Not
Be a Son):** He may be a son and may not be a son. 4. **Syat Avaktavya (May Be
Indeterminate):** It may be indeterminate whether he is a son or not. 5. **Syat
Putra Avaktavya (May Be a Son and May Be Indeterminate):** He may be a son and
it may be indeterminate whether he is a son or not. 6. **Syat Aputra Avaktavya
(May Not Be a Son and May Be Indeterminate):** He may not be a son and it may be
indeterminate whether he is a son or not. 7. **Syat Putra Aputra Avaktavya (May
Be a Son, May Not Be a Son, and May Be Indeterminate):** He may be a son, may
not be a son, and it may be indeterminate whether he is a son or not.  **The
Seven-fold Predicament and Statements:**  The phrase "Syat Asti Dravyam" (May Be
Substance) indicates the seven-fold predicament. This is because:  * **Syat
Asti:** This phrase is a general statement that applies to all substances. *
**Asti Dravyam:** This phrase is a specific statement that applies to a
particular substance.  **Statements and Their Validity:**  * **Syat Asti:** This
is a valid statement based on the seven-fold predicament. * **Asti Dravyam:**
This is a valid statement based on the seven-fold predicament. * **Asti
Dravyam:** This is an invalid statement based on the seven-fold predicament. *
**Asti Dravyam:** This is an invalid statement based on the seven-fold
predicament.  **Conclusion:**  The seven-fold predicament is a fundamental
principle of Jain philosophy that helps us understand the nature of reality. It
teaches us that all things are subject to change and that our knowledge is
always limited.  **Note:** This translation preserves the Jain terms and
provides a detailed explanation of the seven-fold predicament. It also clarifies
the application of the seven-fold predicament to the five categories of
substance.

## Sevenfold Predicament (Saptabhangi)  **4. Panchaastikaya Prabhrit**  **55.**
**(1)** **Syat Asti:**  Meaning, in some respects, the substance exists. This
means the substance exists in relation to its own substance, space, time, and
mode of existence (the fourfold).   **(2)** **Syat Nasti:** Meaning, in some
respects, the substance does not exist. This means the substance does not exist
in relation to other substances, space, time, and mode of existence (the
fourfold).  **(3)** **Syat Asti Nasti:** Meaning, in some respects, the
substance both exists and does not exist. This means it exists in relation to
its own fourfold but does not exist in relation to the other fourfold.  **(4)**
**Syat Avaktvy:** Meaning, in some respects, the substance is inexpressible.
This means it cannot be said at one time whether the substance exists in
relation to its own fourfold or not in relation to the other fourfold, because
it is said, "Kramapravritti Bharti" - speech can only be spoken in a sequential
manner.  **(5)** **Syat Asti Avaktvy:** Meaning, in some respects, the substance
exists and is inexpressible. This means it exists in relation to its own
substance, space, time, and mode of existence, but simultaneously, its relation
to its own and other substances, space, time, and mode of existence is
inexpressible.  **(6)** **Syat Nasti Avaktvy:** Meaning, in some respects, the
substance does not exist and is inexpressible. This means it does not exist in
relation to other substances, space, time, and mode of existence, but
simultaneously, its relation to its own and other substances, space, time, and
mode of existence is inexpressible.  **(7)** **Syat Asti Nasti Avaktvy:**
Meaning, in some respects, the substance exists, does not exist, and is
inexpressible. This means it exists in relation to its own fourfold, does not
exist in relation to the other fourfold, but simultaneously, its relation to its
own and other substances, space, time, and mode of existence is inexpressible.
In this way, these seven predicaments are possible in relation to substance.
**(1)** Does the substance exist?  **(2)** Does the substance not exist?
**(3)** Does the substance both exist and not exist?  **(4)** Is the substance
inexpressible?  **(5)** Does the substance exist and is inexpressible?  **(6)**
Does the substance not exist and is inexpressible?  **(7)** Does the substance
exist, not exist, and is inexpressible?  When these questions are asked, they
are answered in these seven ways. This is the nature of the Sevenfold
Predicament.  How can the same substance have seven predicaments? To answer
this, consider Devadatta, a man. He is one, but he is also many in relation to
different perspectives. Devadatta is a father in relation to his son, a son in
relation to his father, a nephew in relation to his uncle, an uncle in relation
to his nephew, a husband in relation to his wife, a brother in relation to his
sister, an enemy in relation to his enemy, and a friend in relation to his
friend. Similarly, the same substance can have seven predicaments in relation to
different perspectives. There is no fault in this, it is a general explanation.
If we want a more subtle explanation, then the substance has an inherent nature
of being, which is eternal...

## Description of the Six Substances and the Five Astikayas  In the description
of each of the six substances, seven **bhangas** (categories) should be
mentioned. These are:  * **Syat asti** (It may be), **Syat nasti** (It may not
be), **Syat astinaasti** (It may be and may not be), **Syat avaktvy** (It may be
unmentionable) * **Syat ek** (It may be one), **Syat anek** (It may be many),
**Syat ek-anek** (It may be one and many), **Syat avaktvy** (It may be
unmentionable) * **Syat nitya** (It may be eternal), **Syat anitya** (It may be
non-eternal), **Syat nityanitya** (It may be eternal and non-eternal), **Syat
avaktvy** (It may be unmentionable)  These seven **bhangas** for each substance
are similar to the example of Devadatta. For example, the same Devadatta:  1.
**Syat putra** (May be a son) - in relation to his father, he is a son. 2.
**Syat aputra** (May not be a son) - in relation to others besides his father,
he is not a son. 3. **Syat putra aputra** (May be both a son and not a son) - in
relation to his father, he is a son, and in relation to others, he is not a son.
4. **Syat avaktvy** (May be unmentionable) - at the same time, with different
perspectives, it cannot be said whether he is a son or not a son. 5. **Syat
putra avaktvy** (May be a son and unmentionable) - when Devadatta is a son in
relation to his father, at the same time, it is not possible to say whether he
is a son or not a son, so it is unmentionable. 6. **Syat aputra avaktvy** (May
not be a son and unmentionable) - when Devadatta is not a son in relation to
others besides his father, at the same time, it is not possible to say whether
he is a son or not a son, so it is unmentionable. 7. **Syat putra aputra
avaktvy** (May be a son, not a son, and unmentionable) - in relation to his
father, he is a son, in relation to others, he is not a son, and at the same
time, it is not possible to say whether he is a son or not a son, so it is
unmentionable.  In this way, one should understand the **saptabhangi**
(sevenfold predication) through subtle explanation. By reading "**Syat dravya**"
(It may be a substance), etc., the **saptabhangi** principle is understood.
Because the statement "**Syat asti**" (It may be) encompasses all things, it is
a **pramana** (proof) statement. The statement "**Syat asti ev dravyam**" (It
may be a substance) encompasses only one aspect of a thing, its mere existence,
and therefore it is a **naya** (viewpoint) statement.  As it is said,
"**Sakalaadesha pramanadheen, vikalaadesha nayadheen**" (The statement
encompassing all aspects is under the purview of **pramana**, and the statement
encompassing only a part is under the purview of **naya**).  "**Asti dravyam**"
(It is a substance) is a **duhpramna** (incorrect proof) statement, and "**Asti
ev dravyam**" (It is a substance) is a **durnya** (incorrect viewpoint)
statement.  In this way, one should understand the explanation through
**pramana** (proof) and other categories. Here, among the six substances, the
**jivaastikaya** (living being) is the pure **atmadravya** (soul substance) that
is worthy of being grasped.  This is the meaning.  Thus, the **saptabhangi** is
explained through one sutra (aphorism). In this way, the first seven verses are
completed in fourteen verses, with five **sthala** (categories).  ## Time
Explanation Verse 15  **Atrasadpradurabhavatvamutpadasy saducchedatvam vigamasya
nishiddham.**  (The emergence of the non-existent, the destruction of the
existent, and the cessation of the non-existent are prohibited.)

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  **Sanskrit Commentary
Verse 15**  Now, when there is a Dharmi (possessor of qualities), qualities are
considered. There is no substance, so how can there be seven bhangas (modes of
existence)?  Following the Buddhist view, the disciple raises this objection. In
response, the Acharya presents a verse to refute this objection.  He refutes the
momentary annihilationist Buddhist view by stating that according to the
Dravyarthika Nay (substance-based perspective), there is no destruction of a
real substance, and there is no creation of a non-existent substance.
**Meaning:**  * There is no destruction (naso) of a substance (bhavasa). *
Similarly, there is no creation (uppaado) of a non-existent substance
(abhavaassa). * Substances (bhaasa) undergo change (pakuvvanti) in their
qualities (gunapjjayeasu) through creation and destruction.  **Explanation:**  *
Just as there is no creation or destruction of the substance called "goraasa"
(milk) in its own form, similarly, there is no creation or destruction of the
substance called "jiva" (soul) in its own form. * However, the qualities of
"goraasa" (milk) like color, taste, smell, and touch undergo transformation.
When the "goraasa" (milk) transforms into "navanita" (butter), it is destroyed,
but it does not transform into "ghrita" (clarified butter). * Similarly, the
substance called "jiva" (soul) exists in its own form, but its qualities undergo
transformation. The six substances (jiva, ajiva, etc.) are the agents of these
transformations.  **Note:**  * The text mentions "shuddha parinaamik parambhava
grahaka" (purely transformative ultimate reality) and "shuddha dravyarthika nay"
(pure substance-based perspective). * It also mentions "nishchaya nay"
(definitive perspective) and "krodha, mana, bhaya, aloba, drish, shruta,
anubhuta, bhoga, aakanksha, rupanidana, bandha, adi paribhava shunya" (free from
the influence of anger, mind, fear, non-greed, sight, hearing, experience,
enjoyment, desire, form, cause, and bondage). * The text concludes by stating
that the pure soul (shuddha jiva) is filled with infinite knowledge and bliss
(chidananda ekasvabhaava) and should be meditated upon.  **Hindi Commentary
Verse 15**  **Uththānikā:**  Further, the disciple who follows the Buddhist view
raises this doubt or objection: If there is a Dharmi (possessor of qualities),
then one should consider his qualities or nature. If there is no substance, then
how can there be seven bhangas (modes of existence)?  **Answer:** The Acharya
responds by saying that according to the Dravyarthika Nay (substance-based
perspective), there is no destruction of a real substance, and there is no
creation of a non-existent substance. In this way, he refutes the momentary
annihilationist Buddhist view.  **General Meaning with Anvaya (word order):**  *
(Bhavasa) Substance (naso) destruction (nasthi) does not happen, (cheva)
similarly (abhavaassa) non-existence (uppaado) creation (nasthi) does not
happen. * (Bhaasa) Substance (gunapjjayeasu) in its qualities (uppaadavaye)
creation and destruction (pakuvvanti) keep happening.  **Specific Meaning:**  *
For example, "goraasa" (milk) is a substance. There is no creation or
destruction of "goraasa" (milk) in its own form. However, the qualities of
"goraasa" (milk) like color, taste, smell, and touch undergo transformation.
When the "goraasa" (milk) transforms into "navanita" (butter), it is destroyed,
but it does not transform into "ghrita" (clarified butter).  **Verse 15
concludes the first section of the second saptaka (seven verses) and presents a
refutation of the Buddhist view on substance.**

Just as there are synonyms in the Prakrit language, so too are the six
substances, namely, the living being, etc., which are eternally existent, never
destroyed in terms of substance, according to the substance-based viewpoint. And
those substances that are non-existent or not present, such as the living being,
etc., are never produced in terms of substance, according to the substance-based
viewpoint. However, the six substances, namely, the living being, etc., are
produced and destroyed as much as possible in terms of synonyms, according to
the synonym-based viewpoint, in the context of the synonyms of qualities. For
example, there are synonyms such as male, female, hell-being, etc., in living
beings, and synonyms such as two-atom, aggregate, etc., in matter. And there are
synonyms in dharma due to the presence of motion-cooperative, in adharma due to
the presence of stability-cooperative, in space due to the presence of
immersion-cooperative, and in time due to the presence of duration-cooperative.
Here, in the context of the six substances, one should meditate on the pure
self-substance called the living being, which is filled with infinite, eternal,
knowledge-bliss, and is free from the causes of bondage, such as anger, pride,
deceit, greed, and the desire for experienced pleasures, according to the pure
substance-based viewpoint, which accepts the pure result-based ultimate reality,
or according to the definitive viewpoint, even though it is devoid of these
causes of bondage or free from production and destruction. This is the meaning.
In this way, the sutra was spoken, establishing the substance for the Buddhists
in the second septet. ||15||  Time Explanation Verse-16 Here, the synonyms of
qualities and states are explained. The states are the living being, etc., and
the qualities of the living being are consciousness, etc., and their use. There
are many synonyms for the living being, such as celestial being, human being,
hell-being, and animal. ||16||  States are the living being, etc., the six
substances. Their qualities and synonyms are well-known. However, they are
mentioned here for the sake of clarity, as will be explained in the examples to
be given. The qualities of the living being are pure consciousness, which is
characterized by knowledge and experience, impure consciousness, which is
characterized by the experience of action and its results, and the use of both,
which is characterized by the result that follows consciousness and is in the
form of with-thought and without-thought, and which encompasses all forms of
thought and non-thought, both pure and impure. Synonyms, however, are pure,
being characterized by the increase and decrease of gross and subtle qualities,
and the removal and attainment of qualities. Those obtained from the sutras are
impure, being characterized by celestial being, human being, hell-being, and
animal, due to the absence of connection with other substances. ||16||  Hindi

## Description of Six Substances, Five Astikayas (Qualities of the Soul)
**Qualities of the Soul (Consciousness and Utilization)**  Consciousness and
utilization are the qualities of the soul.  **Synonyms of the Soul**  The soul
has many synonyms, such as deva (god), manushya (human), naraka (hell being),
and tiryanch (animal).  **Commentary:**  Here, we are explaining the **bhavas
(substances)**, **gunas (qualities)**, and **paryayas (synonyms)**.  The six
substances, starting with the soul, are the **bhavas**. Their qualities and
synonyms are well-known. However, to clarify the examples that will be given in
the next verse, we are mentioning the qualities and synonyms of the soul here.
The qualities of the soul are **pure consciousness** in the form of knowledge
and perception, and **impure consciousness** in the form of action and the
experience of its fruits. There are two types of utilization: **pure** and
**impure**, which are characterized by **savikalpa (with discrimination)** and
**nirvikalpa (without discrimination)**, respectively. They are also
characterized by **purity, impurity, and mixed states**.  The synonyms of the
soul are as follows:  * **Pure synonyms** are those that arise from the
**increase or decrease of the qualities of the soul**. * **Impure synonyms** are
those that are mentioned in this verse, such as deva, naraka, tiryanch, and
manushya. They arise from the **relationship with other substances**.  **Verse
16:**  Thus, the qualities and synonyms of the substances mentioned in the
previous verse are explained.  **Sanskrit Commentary:**  The substances starting
with the soul are the **bhavas**. What are they? The six substances starting
with the soul, and the four substances starting with dharma, have qualities and
synonyms, which will be explained in detail in their respective places. Here, we
are explaining the qualities of the soul.  The qualities of the soul are
consciousness and utilization. What are they? There are two types of
consciousness: pure and impure. **Knowledge and perception** are the utilization
of pure consciousness. This is a summary statement, a **vartika (commentary)**,
a **samudaya-kathana (general statement)**, a **tatparya-arthakathana (statement
of meaning)**, and a **sampindita-arthakathana (statement of condensed
meaning)**.  For example, **knowledge-consciousness** is called **pure
consciousness**, while **karma-consciousness** and **karma-phala-consciousness**
are called **impure consciousness**. These three types of consciousness will be
explained in detail later in the section on consciousness.  Now, we will explain
utilization. **Savikalpa** is the utilization of knowledge, while **nirvikalpa**
is the utilization of perception. There are eight types of knowledge-
utilization: **mati (belief)**, **shruta (scriptural knowledge)**, **avadhi
(clairvoyance)**, **manas-paryaya (knowledge of the mind)**, and **kevala-jnana
(omniscience)**. There are also three types of **ajnana (ignorance)**: **kumati
(wrong belief)**, **kushrut (wrong scriptural knowledge)**, and **vibhang (wrong
perception)**.  Among these, **kevala-jnana** is **pure** and **kshayika
(impermanent)** because it is **niravarana (without obstacles)**. The other
seven types of knowledge, starting with **mati**, are **impure** and **kshaya-
upashamaka (mitigating impermanence)** because they are **savarana (with
obstacles)**.  There are four types of perception-utilization: **chakshu (visual
perception)**, **achakshu (non-visual perception)**, **avadhi (clairvoyance)**,
and **kevala-darshan (omniscience)**. Among these, **kevala-darshan** is
**pure** and **kshayika** because it is **niravarana**. The other three types of
perception, starting with **chakshu**, are **impure** and **kshaya-upashamaka**
because they are **savarana**.  Now, we will explain the synonyms of the soul.
The synonyms of the soul are **deva, naraka, tiryanch, and manushya**. There are
many synonyms of the soul.  Furthermore, there are two types of synonyms:
**dravya-paryaya (synonyms of substance)** and **guna-paryaya (synonyms of
quality)**.  The definition of **dravya-paryaya** is as follows: **A dravya-
paryaya is the cause of the unity of many substances, which is based on the
understanding of that unity.** It is like the unity of many substances in a
single entity.  There are two types of **dravya-paryaya**: **samanajaatiya (of
the same kind)** and **asamanajaatiya (of different kinds)**.  **Samanajaatiya**
is defined as follows: **Two, three, or four or more paramāṇu (atoms) or pudgala
(matter) substances combine to form a single entity.**

Jain terms preserved in the translation:  The five Astikaya (substances) are
said to be related to the non-sentient (achetana) by the other non-sentient
(achetana). The dissimilar (asamanajatiya) is said to be the origination of the
embodied soul (jiva) in the form of human, divine, etc. due to the association
of the karmic matter (pudgala) with the sentient (chetana) jiva. The similar
(samanajatiya) and dissimilar (asamanajatiya) are the modifications (paryaya) of
the single-natured (ekarupa) substances (dravya) of the jiva and pudgala. They
are impure (ashudha). Why? Due to the mutual association (samshlesha) of the
many substances. The modifications (paryaya) do not occur by the mutual
association of substances like dharma, etc. Even the pure (shuddha)
modifications do not arise.  Now, the Muga (a type of soul) is explained. They
are of two types based on the distinction of inherent nature (svabhava) and
modified nature (vibhava). The guna-paryaya, which is the basis for the
apprehension of the oneness of the inherent nature, is present in a single
substance, like the color of green and white, etc. in the pudgala. In the jiva,
it is in the form of knowledge, perception, etc., like the transition of one
knowledge to another. Thus, the modifications (paryaya) in the form of the
inherent and modified qualities of the jiva and pudgala should be known.  The
inherent nature (svabhava) qualities are common to all substances and are in the
form of increase and decrease of the qualities of lightness and heaviness, etc.
Thus, the inherent nature (svabhava) and modified nature (vibhava) qualities
should be known.  Alternatively, the paryayas are of two types: artha-paryaya
(meaning-modifications) and vyanjana-paryaya (expression-modifications). The
artha-paryayas are momentary and are the objects of speech, while the vyanjana-
paryayas are stable, long-lasting, objects of speech, and are the objects of the
deluded perception.  These modified (vibhava) vyanjana-paryayas of the jiva are
the human, infernal, etc. forms, while the inherent nature (svabhava) vyanjana-
paryaya of the jiva is the siddha (liberated) form.  The impure (ashudda) artha-
paryayas of the jiva should be known in the six stages of the passions (kshaya,
upashama, etc.) and the auspicious and inauspicious psychic dispositions
(leshya). The modified (vibhava) artha-paryayas of the pudgala are in the form
of transformation of color, etc. in the skandhas (aggregates) like the atom,
etc. The modified (vibhava) vyanjana-paryayas of the pudgala are also known to
be long-lasting in the skandhas like the atom, etc.  The pure (shudda) artha-
paryayas, in the form of increase and decrease of the qualities of lightness and
heaviness, etc., have already been explained earlier in the description of the
inherent nature (svabhava) qualities.  These artha-paryayas and vyanjana-
paryayas are present among the inherent nature (svabhava) and modified nature
(vibhava) dravya-paryayas and guna-paryayas of the jiva and pudgala, which were
mentioned in the previous verse "Jesim atthisahao". The purpose of explaining
them separately is to indicate the distinction based on time, as the artha-
paryayas are momentary, while the vyanjana-paryayas are long-lasting.  The
essential meaning here is that the pure (shuddha) paryaya, which has attained
the siddha (liberated) form, is the upadeya (worth accepting) pure (shudda)
substance of the jiva.

## Chapter 62: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  This
chapter aims to explain the six substances and five astikayas. The six
substances are: **Jiva**, **Pudgala**, **Dharma**, **Adharma**, **Akasha**, and
**Kala**. The qualities and categories of the four substances, Dharma and the
rest, will be explained in detail later. Here, we will first discuss the
qualities of **Jiva**.  The qualities of **Jiva** are **Chetana**
(consciousness) and **Upayoga** (application). **Chetana** has two types:
**Shuddha Chetana** (pure consciousness) and **Ashuddha Chetana** (impure
consciousness). **Upayoga** also has two types: **Jnana Upayoga** (knowledge
application) and **Darshan Upayoga** (perception application). **Jnana Chetana**
is considered **Shuddha Chetana**. **Karma Chetana** (action consciousness) and
**Karmaphal Chetana** (fruit of action consciousness) are considered **Ashuddha
Chetana**. The nature of these three types of **Chetana** will be explained in
detail later under the heading of **Chetana**.  **Jnana Upayoga** is
**Savikalpa** (with discrimination), while **Darshan Upayoga** is **Nirvikalpa**
(without discrimination). **Jnana Upayoga** has eight types: **Mati**,
**Shruta**, **Avadhi**, **Man:paryaya**, and **Kevala** - these five are
**Samyag Jnana** (right knowledge). The other three are **Kumati**,
**Kushruta**, and **Vibhang Jnana** (wrong knowledge). Among these, **Kevala
Jnana** is pure and free from all **Avarana** (coverings). The remaining seven
types of knowledge, starting with **Mati Jnana**, are **Kshayopa-shamic**
(mitigating the obscurations), have **Avarana**, and are impure.  **Darshan
Upayoga** has four types: **Chakshu Darshan** (eye perception), **Achakshu
Darshan** (non-eye perception), **Avadhi Darshan** (clairvoyance), and **Kevala
Darshan** (omniscience). Among these, **Devan Darshan** (divine perception) is
the most common, free from **Avarana**, and pure. The other three, **Chakshu**
and the rest, are **Kshayopa-shamic**, have **Avarana**, and are impure.  Now,
we will discuss the **Paryayas** (categories) of **Jiva**. **Deva**,
**Manushya**, **Naraki**, and **Tiryanch** are the **Vibhava** (potential)
**Dravya Paryayas** of **Jiva**. These **Paryayas** are of many types. There are
two types of **Paryayas**: **Dravya Paryaya** (substance category) and **Guna
Paryaya** (quality category).  The definition of **Dravya Paryaya** is: the
cause of the knowledge of the unity of many substances. For example, calling a
vehicle made of many parts as a single entity. **Dravya Paryaya** is of two
types: **Samaan Jaatiya** (same species) and **Asamaan Jaatiya** (different
species). **Samaan Jaatiya** refers to the **Skandha** (aggregate) formed by the
combination of two, three, four, or more **Paramanu** (atoms) of **Pudgala
Dravya**. These **Skandhas** are formed due to the association of **Achetana**
(non-conscious) with **Achetana**, hence they are called **Samaan Jaatiya Dravya
Paryaya**.  **Asamaan Jaatiya** refers to the situation when a **Jiva**
transmigrates to another **Gati** (realm) and acquires new **No-karma Pudgalas**
(non-karmic particles) in the form of a new body. This leads to the birth of
**Manushya**, **Deva**, and other **Paryayas**. The **Paryaya** formed by the
combination of **Chetana** (conscious) **Jiva** with **Achetana** (non-
conscious) **Pudgala** is called **Asamaan Jaatiya Dravya Paryaya**.  These
**Samaan Jaatiya** and **Asamaan Jaatiya** **Dravya Paryayas**, which are the
unity of many substances, occur only in **Jiva** and **Pudgala**. They are
impure because they are formed by the combination of many substances.
**Dharma**, **Adharma**, **Akasha**, and **Kala** do not have any **Paryayas**
formed by mutual combination. They also do not have any impure **Paryayas** due
to association with other substances.  Now, we will discuss **Guna Paryayas**.
They are also of two types: **Swabhava Guna Paryaya** (inherent quality
category) and **Vibhava Guna Paryaya** (potential quality category). The
**Paryaya** that is the cause of the knowledge of the unity within due to the
quality is called **Guna Paryaya**. It occurs within a single substance. For
example, the **Pudgala** in the form of a mango fruit...

The five *āstikāyas* (types of soul) have their own *varṇaguṇas* (color-
qualities) which are described by terms like green, yellow, etc. Each *āstikāya*
has a unique *varṇaguṇa* which is why it is called a *guṇaparyāya* (quality-
category). The soul's knowledge, such as *matijñāna* (knowledge of perception),
*śruta-jñāna* (knowledge of scriptures), etc., are also *guṇaparyāyas* because
they are different forms of knowledge. Each *guṇaparyāya* represents a unique
aspect of the knowledge quality. It is important to understand the *vibhava*
(potential) and *svabhāva* (inherent) *guṇaparyāyas* of both the soul and
*pudgala* (matter). The *svabhāva* *guṇaparyāyas* are the six *guṇas*
(qualities) of *aguru* (heavy), *laghu* (light), *haani* (diminution), *vṛddhi*
(increase), etc., which are common to all substances. In this way, one should
understand the *svabhāva* and *vibhava* *guṇaparyāyas*.  Alternatively, there
are two types of *paryāyas*: *artha-paryāya* (meaning-category) and *vyañjana-
paryāya* (expression-category). *Artha-paryāyas* are extremely subtle and exist
only for a fleeting moment, disappearing as quickly as they appear. They are not
perceptible to speech. *Vyañjana-paryāyas* are gross, lasting for a longer
duration, perceptible to speech, and even visible to those with limited
knowledge. The *vibhava* *vyañjana-paryāyas* of the soul are its various states,
such as human, hellish, etc., while the *svabhāva* *vyañjana-paryāya* is the
soul's state of liberation. The *artha-paryāyas* of the soul, which are not
pure, are to be understood as the states of purification or defilement that
arise from the increase or decrease of the soul's *kaṣāyas* (passions) and the
six *leśyā* (shades of karma). The *vibhava* *artha-paryāyas* of *pudgala* are
the changes in the *skandhas* (aggregates) of two atoms, etc., from one *varṇa*
(color) to another. The *vibhava* *vyañjana-paryāyas* of *pudgala* are the
*skandhas* of two atoms, etc., which persist for a long time. The *śuddha*
(pure) *artha-paryāyas* are the six *guṇas* of *aguru*, *laghu*, *haani*,
*vṛddhi*, etc., which we have already discussed in the context of *svabhāva*
*guṇaparyāyas* as being common to all substances.  These *artha-paryāyas* and
*vyañjana-paryāyas* are implicit in the verses like "Just as there are many
*sahaos* (companions)" etc., which describe the *svabhāva* and *vibhava*
*dravya-paryāyas* (substance-categories) and *svabhāva* and *vibhava*
*guṇaparyāyas* of the soul and *pudgala*. They are also present within the
*dravya-paryāyas* and *guṇaparyāyas* mentioned in this verse. Why then are they
mentioned separately? The answer is that *artha-paryāyas* are said to exist only
for a moment, while *vyañjana-paryāyas* are said to exist for a long time. They
are mentioned to highlight this difference in duration. The implication here is
that one should strive to attain the pure *jīvā-āstikāya* (soul-category), the
pure *ātma-dravya* (soul-substance), which is capable of transforming into the
state of liberation.  **Verse 17:**  This is an example of the prohibition of
the arising of the thought of existence and non-existence. A human being thinks,
"This body is mine, this god is mine." But the soul is neither existent nor non-
existent, nor is it born from another.

##  Verse 64: Explanation of the Five Categories of Substance  **A being who has
lost their human form becomes a god or something else. In both cases, the
essence of life is neither destroyed nor created anew.**  **Commentary:**  This
verse explains that the essence of life (Jiva) is not destroyed or created anew
when a being changes its form. It is like a river that flows continuously,
changing its form as it passes through different landscapes. The essence of the
river remains the same, even though its form changes.  The verse states that a
being who has lost their human form (through death) becomes a god or something
else (like a hell being or an animal) due to their past actions. However, the
essence of life (Jiva) remains the same. It is not destroyed or created anew.
The verse also explains that the change in form is not a real destruction or
creation. It is a transformation, a change in the way the essence of life
manifests itself. The essence of life remains the same, but its form changes
according to the actions of the being.  This verse refutes the idea that the
essence of life is destroyed or created anew. It emphasizes that the essence of
life is eternal and unchanging. It only changes its form according to the
actions of the being.  **Translation of the Sanskrit terms:**  * **द्रव्य

**Verse 17**  **General Meaning:** (The embodied being) This embodied worldly
being (by the category of being a human) is destroyed as a human (and becomes) a
god (or) another (being). In both states, the being-substance (is not destroyed)
nor is another being produced.  **Specific Meaning:** This worldly being, if it
is in a human body and dies, then by virtue of its merit, it becomes a god or by
virtue of its own karma, it becomes another being, a hell-being, an animal, or a
human. Although, from the perspective of categories, the human existence is
destroyed, but from the perspective of substance, the being that had the human
existence is not destroyed. Similarly, although from the perspective of
categories, the god category is produced, but from the perspective of substance,
no new being is produced, but it is the same being that was previously in the
human category. Therefore, it is certain that even though there is production
and destruction from the perspective of categories, there is no production and
destruction from the perspective of substance. This explanation refutes the view
of momentary oneness and the view of eternal oneness.  **Verse 18**
**Meaning:** Even though there is production and destruction, the substance is
always undestroyed and unproduced.  **Commentary:** The same being that takes
birth and dies is not destroyed, nor is it produced. The being that is produced
and destroyed is a god, a human, etc., which is a category. The being that is
perceived as arising and ceasing, due to the contact of the categories of
previous and subsequent existence, is the same being that is perceived as
undestroyed and unproduced, due to its inherent nature, which is the basis of
its constant oneness. Categories, however, are described as having the nature of
being capable of destruction, being like the previous transformation and being
the production of the subsequent transformation. They are said to be distinct
from the substance. Therefore, the being-substance, which is one with the
categories, is to be seen as always unproduced and undestroyed, even though it
is born and dies. The categories of god, human, etc., arise and cease due to
their sequential nature, being present and then passing away, and being produced
and destroyed at their respective times.

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  **Verse 18 of the Hindi
Time Explanation**  **Meaning:** (It is the same) The same (jati) birth it
receives and the same (maranm yati) death it attains, however (na ev utpannah)
it is not born (cha) and (na nashttah) not destroyed, (dev: manushyah) the god,
the human (iti paryayah) such synonyms (utpannah) are born (cha) and (vinashtah)
destroyed.  **Commentary:** Here, although the substance is said to be subject
to destruction and production, it is always said to be indestructible and
unproduced.  The substance that appears to be destroyed and produced by the
separation from the previous synonym and the combination with the next synonym,
the same (substance) is known to be indestructible and unproduced due to its
inherent nature, which is the cause of the constant-one-reality, in relation to
that nature. Its synonyms are said to be of the nature of destruction and
production due to the destruction of the previous result and the production of
the next result, and they (synonyms) are said to be inseparable from the
substance in reality. Therefore, even though it is born and dies due to the
oneness with the synonyms, the living substance is always seen (believed) to be
unproduced and indestructible. The synonyms like god, human, etc., are born and
destroyed because they are sequential, their own time is present and passes.

##  Pancastikaya Prabhrit  **Hindi Tatparyavritti Gatha-18 Uththanika -**
Further, these two Nayas (principles) strengthen this meaning.  **Anvaya Saha
Samanyarth -** (So Cheva Jadi) The same Jiva (soul) is born who (Maranam Jadi)
attains death. (Na Nattho) In reality, the Jiva is neither destroyed (Na Chaiva
Uppanno) nor born. (Devo Manusuutti Pajjao) The categories of Deva (god) or
Manushya (human) are (Uppanno Ya Vinattho) born and destroyed.  **Vishesharth
-**  According to the Paryayarthika Naya (principle of categories), the same
Jiva attains the Deva category who was previously in the Manushya category.
From a Paakshika (conventional) perspective, no Jiva is destroyed or born. Then,
who is destroyed and who is born?  For this, it is said that according to the
Paryayarthika Naya, the Deva category is born and the Manushya category is
destroyed.   Here, someone might question: If there is birth and destruction in
a substance, then how can it be eternal? And if the substance is eternal, then
how can there be birth and destruction in it? These two things are
contradictory, like the opposition between cold and hot.  To address this
objection, the Acharya (teacher) explains that in the view of those who believe
that the substance is eternally one or eternally transient, this objection is
valid. Because, the aspect of eternity cannot exist in the same way as the
aspect of transience, and vice versa. This is because they consider the
substance to be of one form.  In Jainism, the substance is considered to have
multiple aspects. Therefore, according to the Dravyarthika Naya (principle of
substance), the aspect of eternity exists in the substance with respect to its
Dravyatva (substance-ness), and according to the Paryayarthika Naya, the aspect
of transience exists in the substance with respect to its Paryaya (category).
These two, Dravya and Paryaya, are interdependent. This interdependence was
already mentioned in this Gatha: "Pajjayarhiyam Davvam Davvimutta Ya Pajjaya
Pasthi".   Therefore, by explaining through the Dravyarthika and Paryayarthika
Nayas, with the primary and secondary aspects, both eternity and transience
exist in the same substance. Just like in the same Devadatta, both fatherhood
and sonship are established. There is no contradiction in this. ||18||  **Samaya
Vyakhya Gatha-19**  Here, the non-destruction and non-birth of the soul are
presented as the standpoint of permanence.  **Evam Sado Vinaso Asado Jivass
Natthi Uppaado. Tavadiyo Jivaanam Devo Manuso Tti Gadinaamo. ||19||**  Thus,
there is no destruction of the eternal and no birth of the non-eternal.
Therefore, the Jivas are called Deva or Manushya. ||19||

68 Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas, and the Non-Destruction
of the Real and the Non-Production of the Unreal. The life of a being is not
destroyed, nor is an unreal being produced. The life of beings is only as long
as the names of their states, such as god and human. ||19|| If, indeed, the
being that dies is the same one that is born, and the being that is born is the
same one that dies, then it is established that there is no destruction of the
real and no production of the unreal. What is said, that a god is born and a
human dies, is not contradictory because the god-state and human-state names,
which are the creators of the limited-time god-state and human-state, are only
as long as those states. Just as the many segments of a large bamboo stalk,
being limited in their own measure, do not go to another segment, but are
present in their own places and absent in other places, and the bamboo, though
present in all the segments, is absent in relation to another segment because of
the absence of a connection to that segment, so also the many human-state and
other states of a single life substance, which exists for an unlimited period of
three times, being limited in their own measure, do not go to another state, but
are present in their own places and absent in other places, and the life
substance, though present in all the states, is absent in relation to another
state because of the absence of a connection to that state. ||19|| Hindi Time
Explanation Verse-19 _ Anvayaartha (evam) thus (jivasya) of the being (satah
vinashah) the destruction of the real and (asatah utpadah) the production of the
unreal (na asti) is not (dev janmata hai aur manushya marata hai aisa kaha jata
hai uska yah karan hai ki) (jivaanam) of the beings (dev: manushya:) god, human
(iti gatinaam) such state-names (tavat) only as long as (kalaka hota hai).
Commentary-Here, the non-destruction of the real and the non-production of the
unreal are said from the side of certainty. If, indeed, the being that dies is
the same one that is born, and the being that is born is the same one that dies,
then it is established that there is no destruction of the real and no
production of the unreal. And what is said, that a god is born and a human dies,
is (also) not contradictory because the limited-time god-state and human-state,
which are the creators of the limited-time god-state and human-state, are only
as long as those states. Just as the many segments of a large bamboo stalk,
being limited in their own measure, do not go to another segment, but are
present in their own places and absent in other places, and the bamboo, though
present in all the segments, is absent in relation to another segment because of
the absence of a connection to that segment, so also the many human-state and
other states of a single life substance, which exists for an unlimited period of
three times, being limited in their own measure, do not go to another state, but
are present in their own places and absent in other places, and the life
substance, though present in all the states, is absent in relation to another
state because of the absence of a connection to that state.

69 Even though it has a being in all the states of the five astikayas, it is
also non-existent due to the absence of the relation of another astikaya by the
relation of another astikaya. ||19|| Sanskrit Tatparya Vritti Gatha-19 Thus, it
is certain that from the perspective of the dravya-arthicnaya, there is no
destruction of the sat and no production of the asat. Thus, even though from the
perspective of the paryayarthicnaya, production and destruction occur in the
form of humans, narakas, etc., from the perspective of the dravya-arthicnaya,
there is no destruction of the existing sat and no production of the asat, which
is the absence of knowledge. Of what? Of the being, the jiva-padartha. Now, if
it is not to be produced, then how does the explanation that it exists in the
bhogabhumi for the duration of three palyas and then dies, or that it exists in
the deva-loka and naraka-loka for the duration of thirty-three sagaras and then
dies, etc., hold true? The amount that is said of the jivas, such as deva,
manushya, etc., is the paryay, which is caused by the karma-udaya, which is
called the गतिनामक. It is not the amount of the dravya itself, so there is no
contradiction like the bamboo stick. Just as a large bamboo stick has many
joints that exist in their own places and are present, and are absent in the
places of other joints, and the bamboo stick itself, though present in all the
joints, is said to be absent in the second joint in the form of the first joint,
so also the jiva, which is in the place of the bamboo stick, has many paryayas
in the form of human, naraka, etc., which are present in their own time of
karma-udaya and are absent in the time of other paryayas, and the jiva itself,
though present in all the paryayas in all the joints, is said to be absent in
the deva-adi paryayas in the form of the manushya-adi paryayas. If it is asked
how the same thing can be both eternal and non-eternal, then the answer is: Just
as in the case of a certain Devadatta, the desire for a son is secondary when
there is a desire for a father, and the desire for a father is secondary when
there is a desire for a son, so also in the case of a certain jiva, or the jiva-
dravya, from the perspective of the dravya-arthicnaya, the non-eternality in the
form of the paryay is secondary when there is a desire for eternality, and the
eternality in the form of the dravya is secondary when there is a desire for
non-eternality in the form of the paryay. Why? Because the desired is the
primary. Here, even though there is non-eternality in the form of the paryay,
from the perspective of the pure dravya-arthicnaya, the pure jiva-astikaya,
which is imperishable and infinite knowledge, etc., is the pure atma-dravya,
which is to be contemplated as the object of attainment by the removal of raga,
etc. ||19|| Thus, in the first place, a single-verse gatha was spoken earlier to
refute the Buddhist view, and in the second place, four gathas were spoken to
explain it. Hindi Tatparya Vritti Gatha-19 Uththānikā - Further, we assert that
from the perspective of the dravya-arthicnaya, there is no destruction of the
sat and no production of the asat. This is the established truth. Anvaya Sahit
Samanyarth - (evam) In this way, as we have said before, (sado jivas) the sat
substance, the jiva, (vinas) does not perish, and (asado) the asat substance,
the jiva, (uppado) does not come into existence. (jivaan) The worldly jivas
(tavadio) are in such a state, which (devo manusoti gadinaamo) is the result of
their karma-udaya, which is called the deva or manushya-gati.

---------------------------
In the first three verses, it has been stated that although the substance of the
living being (Jiva) is subject to birth and death in the form of human, animal,
etc., according to the **Paryaya** (relational) viewpoint, yet according to the
**Dravya** (substance) viewpoint, the **Satrupa** (existing substance) does not
perish, and the **Asatrupa** (non-existing substance) is not born. Here, someone
may doubt that if the living being does not experience birth and death, then how
is it proven that this living being stays in the **Bhogabhumi** (realm of
experience) for three **Palyas** (units of time) and then dies, or stays in the
**Devagati** (heavenly realm) or **Narakagati** (hellish realm) for thirty-three
**Sagaras** (units of time) and then dies? The answer is that this state of
three **Palyas**, etc., mentioned for the living beings, is the measure of the
state of the **Paryaya** (relational) of the **Dev** (god) or **Manushya**
(human) born from the **Uday** (arising) of the **Namakarma** (karmic influence)
called **Dev** or **Manushya** (god or human), and not of the **Jiva** (living
being) substance. There is no contradiction in this, as illustrated by the
example of a bamboo stick. Just as in a very large bamboo stick, many knots are
present in their respective places, these knots are not present on top of each
other, i.e., each knot or **Parya** (segment) has its own distinct existence,
but the bamboo stick is present in all the **Paryas** (segments) in a
**Anvayarupa** (consequential) manner, yet it can be said that it is not in the
same place in the second **Parya** (segment) as it is in the first **Parya**
(segment). Similarly, in this **Jiva** (living being) substance, like the bamboo
stick, there are many **Paryas** (relational states) like human, animal, etc.,
present in their respective times of **Ayukarma** (life-span karma) **Uday**
(arising). These **Paryas** (relational states) are not present in the time of
each other's **Paryas** (relational states) - all **Paryas** (relational states)
are distinct, and this **Jiva** (living being) is present in all its **Paryas**
(relational states) in a **Anvayarupa** (consequential) manner, yet it can be
said that it is not in the **Dev** (god) etc. **Paryas** (relational states) in
the form of **Manushya** (human) etc. **Paryas** (relational states). In other
words, it is proven that the same **Jiva** (living being) is eternal and the
same **Jiva** (living being) is impermanent. How? It is said that just as when
**Devadatta** is seen from the perspective of a son, the aspect of fatherhood is
secondary, and when he is seen from the perspective of a father, the aspect of
sonship is secondary. Similarly, when a **Jiva** (living being) substance is
considered from the **Dravya** (substance) viewpoint, the aspect of impermanence
from the **Paryaya** (relational) viewpoint is secondary, and when it is
considered from the **Paryaya** (relational) viewpoint, the aspect of eternity
from the **Dravya** (substance) viewpoint is secondary. Because what is desired
is considered primary. The meaning here is that although it is impermanent from
the **Paryaya** (relational) viewpoint, it is the pure **Jiva** (living being)
substance, the pure **Atmadravya** (soul substance) called **Jivaastikaya**
(living being body) which is eternal, infinite knowledge, etc., from the pure
**Dravya** (substance) viewpoint, and it is this that should be embraced by
abandoning the **Raga** (attachment) etc. emotions. It is this that should be
contemplated. || 19 ||  In this way, the **Sutragatha** (verse) which was first
mentioned in the first place to refute **Buddhamati** (Buddhist philosophy), was
explained in detail in the second place in four verses.

##  Verse 20:  **18** **Panchaastikaya Prabhrut** **Samaya Vyakhya Gatha-20**
Here, the production of the Siddha from utter non-existence is prohibited. The
karmas like knowledge-obscuring, etc., are firmly bound to the Jiva. When these
karmas cease to exist, the Siddha becomes unprecedented. ||20||  **Commentary:**
Just as in the case of a bamboo stick, where the vision, having descended to the
perfectly pure upper part, after being obstructed by the variegated and diverse
rays of light in the lower part, perceives the pervasiveness of the variegated
and diverse rays of light everywhere, and concludes that the stick is impure
everywhere; similarly, in the case of the Jiva-dravya, the intellect, having
descended to the perfectly pure upper part, after being obstructed by the
variegated and diverse karmas like knowledge-obscuring, etc., in the lower part,
concludes that the Jiva-dravya is impure everywhere. Just as in the case of the
bamboo stick, there is a connection of the variegated and diverse rays of light
with the illusory knowledge of pervasiveness, so also in the case of the Jiva-
dravya, there is a connection of the karmas like knowledge-obscuring, etc., with
the variegated and diverse rays of light. Just as in the case of the bamboo
stick, the absence of the variegated and diverse rays of light leads to the
purity, so also in the case of the Jiva-dravya, the absence of the variegated
and diverse karmas like knowledge-obscuring, etc., leads to the attainment of
the Siddha-hood, which is defined by the knowledge beyond the senses, obtained
through the right understanding of the scriptures. ||20||  **Hindi Samaya
Vyakhya Gatha-20**  _Anvayaarth (Jnanaavaranadyaah Bhaavaah)_ Knowledge-
obscuring, etc., karmas (Jeevena) are firmly bound to the Jiva (Sushtu) in a
good way (Anubaddhaah). (Teshaam Abaavam Krutvaa) By removing them

## 72  **Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas (further
explained)**  Just as when one looks at a very long bamboo stick, whose lower
half is partially covered and partially uncovered with various colorful
paintings, and whose upper half is completely covered and pure (unpainted), the
vision, determining the pervasiveness of the colorfulness caused by the various
paintings, concludes that "the bamboo is completely impure (i.e., entirely
colorful)", similarly, when one applies intellect to a living being whose lower
part, very large and filled with variegatedness (various vibhava-paryayas)
caused by karma like jnana-avaran, is partially covered and partially uncovered,
and whose upper part, very large and pure (siddh-paryaya), is completely
covered, the intellect, determining the pervasiveness of the variegatedness
caused by karma like jnana-avaran, concludes that "the being is completely
impure".  Again, just as the cause of the apparent knowledge of pervasiveness in
the bamboo is the continuity (flow) of the colorfulness caused by the various
paintings in the lower uncovered part, similarly, the cause of the apparent
knowledge of pervasiveness in the living being is the continuity of the
variegatedness caused by karma like jnana-avaran in the lower uncovered part.
And just as the bamboo is pure (in the upper part) because there is no
continuity of the colorfulness caused by the various paintings, similarly, the
living being is pure (in the upper part) because there is no continuity of the
variegatedness caused by karma like jnana-avaran, which absence is known through
the knowledge of the authoritative scriptures, correct inferential knowledge,
and extra-sensory perception.  **Commentary on the Sanskrit Meaning of the Verse
20**  Although all beings are pure in their essence according to the dravya-
arthic-naya (doctrine of substance), they are not pure in their paryaya (state)
according to the paryaya-arthic-naya (doctrine of state). This is because the
state of a siddha (liberated being) is not produced. Or, when a human being
dies, the same being is reborn as a deva (god). Similarly, when the state of
samsara (worldly existence) is destroyed due to the absence of mithyatva
(falsehood), raga (attachment), etc., and the state of a siddha is attained,
there is no destruction of the being. In both cases, it is the same being. Or,
according to the dravya-arthic-paryaya-arthic-naya (doctrine of substance and
state), which is relative to each other, the truth is explained as anekanta
(multifaceted). Then, the liberation is explained as the shedding of the
mithyatva, raga, etc., which are the bonds in the form of jnana-avaran, etc., in
the state of samsara, and the attainment of the pure state. Keeping these three
points in mind, the sutra (aphorism) is explained:  "The jnana-avaran, etc., are
firmly bound to the being. The dravya-karma-paryayas (states of substance and
karma) like jnana-acharana, etc., are firmly bound to the samsaric being in the
form of a continuous chain from beginningless time."  "When the being attains
the three jewels of a-bheda (non-duality), ratna (jewel), and a-jheda (non-
destruction), which are obtained through time and effort, and the path of
liberation through practical certainty, then the dravya-karma-paryayas (states
of substance and karma) like jnana-avaran, etc., are destroyed, and the being
becomes a siddha, which is unprecedented according to the paryaya-arthic-naya.
According to the dravya-arthic-naya, the being was already a siddha."
**Explanation**  Just as a large bamboo stick has its lower half covered with
various colorful paintings, making it impure, and its upper half pure because it
is free from those paintings, similarly, when a person named Devadatta looks at
it, he mistakenly believes...

##  Translation:  **Panchaastikaya Prabhrit** 73  **Knowing the impurity due to
the variegated nature of the body, one considers the upper half of the body to
be impure as well. Similarly, this soul, in the state of samsara, remains impure
due to the influence of false beliefs, attachment, etc., and their resultant
transformations. However, internally, it remains pure in its true nature of
omniscience, etc., according to the principle of pure substance. When, being
possessed by attachment, etc., it contemplates with the sensory knowledge of the
form of discrimination, then just as it sees the external part of itself as
impure due to the influence of attachment, etc., it also considers its internal
nature of omniscience, etc., to be impure due to false knowledge. Just as the
variegated nature of the bamboo stick is the cause of false knowledge,
similarly, false beliefs, attachment, etc., are the cause of false knowledge in
the soul. Just as the bamboo stick becomes pure when cleansed of the variegated
nature, similarly, this soul, when it knows the supreme scripture that reveals
the true nature of the pure self in the presence of the gurus, becomes pure.
What kind of scripture? "I am one, without ego, pure, knowing, the object of the
yogi-indras. All external things, born of association, are always different from
me." And so on. Similarly, it knows the inferential knowledge that the body and
the soul are completely different, as they are marked by different
characteristics, like water and fire. Similarly, it knows the knowledge of self-
awareness, free from attachment and discrimination. Thus, from the knowledge of
scripture, inference, self-awareness, and perception, it becomes pure. Here, the
term "Shuddha Jeevaastikaya" refers to the state of being pure, which is
unprecedented and established, and the pure soul substance is the object of
consideration.**  **This is the meaning of the 20th verse.**  **Hindi Meaning of
the Verse:**  **Verse 20**  **Uththānikā:**  Further, it is shown that although
this soul always remains pure according to the principle of pure substance, yet
the unprecedented production of the category, which is established according to
the principle of category, takes place. In other words, the state of being
established, which was never manifested before, is now revealed. Or, it is
explained that just as the same soul remains when the human category is
destroyed and the divine category is born, similarly, the same soul remains when
the category of samsara is destroyed and the category of liberation is born, due
to the disappearance of false beliefs and the transformations of attachment,
aversion, etc. In other words, the soul is the same in both the state of samsara
and the state of liberation. Or, it is said that by understanding the truth
through both the aforementioned principles of pure substance and category, which
are interdependent, one abandons the false beliefs and the transformations of
attachment, etc., which were caused by the bondage of karma, such as knowledge-
obscuring karma, etc., and transforms into pure states. This is how one attains
liberation. Keeping these three points in mind, the next sutra is explained.
**General Meaning with Anvaya:**  **(Jīveṇa) By this worldly soul,
(ṇāṇāvaraṇādīyā) the eight types of karma, such as knowledge-obscuring karma,
(bhāṣā) are bound (suṭhu) firmly (aṇubaddhā). By destroying (tesiṁ) all of them
(abhāvam kicchā), (abhūdapuavo) unprecedented, i.e., what never happened before,
(siddho) becomes established (havadi).

## Six Substances - Description of the Five Astikayas  **Special Meaning:** In
this worldly life, from time immemorial, the nature of karmic substances has
bound the living being. In other words, eight karmas are always found bound to
it in a flowing manner. When a worthy soul, due to the power of the infinite
time of liberation, attains the three jewels of knowledge, conduct, and
liberation, and the three jewels of certainty, liberation, and non-duality,
then, by destroying the substance and the state of being of those karmas like
knowledge-obscuring, etc., it becomes a perfected being through the Paryaya-
arthicnaya. In other words, it attains the perfected state that was never
manifested before. From the perspective of the Dravya-arthicnaya, this living
being is already perfected in its essence.  Just like a large bamboo, the first
half of which is adorned with various paintings, while the upper half is pure
without any intricate designs. When a man named Devadatta sees the painted part
with his vision and fails to see the pure part, then, due to his delusional
knowledge, he considers the entire bamboo to be impure, adorned with intricate
paintings, and assumes the upper half to be impure as well. Similarly, this
living being, in the state of the world, is becoming impure through the Paryaya-
arthicnaya due to the influence of false beliefs, attachment, aversion, and
other subtle influences. However, in its inner nature, it is pure, adorned with
perfect knowledge, etc., through the Dravya-arthicnaya. When it contemplates
through the power of the mind, which is the form of choice, while undergoing
transformation in these influences of attachment, etc., it sees the impure soul
in the form of attachment, etc., in the external part, and similarly, even
though it possesses the nature of perfect knowledge, etc., within, it considers
itself impure due to its deceptive or false knowledge. Just as the mixture of
various paintings in the bamboo is the cause of false knowledge, similarly, the
false beliefs, attachment, aversion, etc., in this living being are the cause of
false knowledge. Just as that bamboo becomes pure when the intricate paintings
are washed away, similarly, this living being also becomes pure when it knows
the supreme path, which illuminates the pure self-nature, in the presence of the
holy gurus, and understands as it is said, "Eko'ham nirmamaḥ śuddho jñānī
yogīndragocaraḥ | Bāhyāḥ saṁyoga-jā bhāvā mattaḥ sarve'pi sarvadā ||" (I am one,
without any attachment, pure, knowledgeable, the object of the yogis. All the
external feelings born of association are always outside my nature). Similarly,
it knows through its inferential knowledge that this body, etc., and the soul
are completely different because they have different characteristics. Just as
water and fire are completely different due to their different characteristics.
In the same way, it experiences through the knowledge of non-attachment, non-
choice, and self-awareness. Then, through the power of the knowledge of the
scriptures, inference, and self-awareness, it becomes pure. Here, the
implication is that the pure soul-substance, which is the never-before-
manifested perfected state, or the pure Jiva-astikaya, is the one that is worthy
of being grasped. || 20 || 74

##  Pancastikaya Prabhrut  75. Thus, in the third realm, by the Paryayarthika
Nay, the unprecedented Paryaya of Siddha is produced. This explanation is the
main point of the gatha.  **Time Explanation Gatha-21**  This is the conclusion
of the justification of the Jiva being the cause of its own production,
destruction, existence, and non-existence.  **Gatha-21**  Thus, the Jiva, being
associated with the Paryayas of its qualities, wanders through existence,
creating existence, non-existence, the existence of non-existence, and the non-
existence of existence.  **Commentary**  Indeed, it is stated that the substance
is always indestructible and unproduced. Therefore, the Jiva substance is said
to be eternal in its substance form. (1) It is said to be the cause of existence
(production) because it manifests in the form of the Paryaya of Devas, etc. (2)
It is said to be the cause of non-existence (destruction) because it manifests
in the form of the Paryaya of humans, etc. (3) It is said to be the cause of the
existence of non-existence because the Deva, etc. Paryaya, which is existing,
begins to be destroyed. (4) It is said to be the cause of the non-existence of
existence because the human, etc. Paryaya, which is non-existing, begins to be
produced. All this is impeccable because it is explained as the predominance of
one or the other quality of the Paryayas of the substance. For example, when the
Jiva is considered as the substance with the quality of Paryaya, then it is
neither produced nor destroyed, nor does it destroy the existing Paryaya group
because of its continuous cycle, nor does it produce the non-existing. But when
the substance is considered as the Paryaya with the quality of substance, then
it manifests, it is destroyed, it destroys the existing Paryaya group which has
exceeded its time, and it produces the non-existing which has not yet come into
existence. This is the grace of Anekantavada, where even this apparent
contradiction is not a contradiction.  **General Explanation**  **Hindi Time
Explanation Gatha-21**  _Anvayarth_ - [Evam] Thus, [guna-paryayaih sahita]
associated with the Paryayas of qualities, [jivah] the Jiva, [sansaran]
wandering, [bhavam] existence, [abhavam] non-existence, [bhaavaabhav] the
existence of non-existence, [cha] and [abhavaabhav] the non-existence of
existence, [karoti] does.  _Tika_ - This is the conclusion of the justification
of the Jiva being the cause of its own production, destruction, existence, and
non-existence.  It is stated in the scriptures that the substance is always
indestructible and unproduced. Therefore, the Jiva substance is said to be
eternal in its substance form. (1) It is said to be the cause of existence
(production) because it manifests in the form of the Paryaya of Devas, etc. (2)
It is said to be the cause of non-existence (destruction) because it manifests
in the form of the Paryaya of humans, etc.

## 76 The destruction of the six substances and the five astikayas is attributed
to the absence (destruction) of the same, because it is obtained. (3) It
destroys the existing (present) gods and their equivalents, therefore it is
called the doer of the destruction of existence (destruction of the existing).
And (4) again, it produces the non-existent (non-existent) humans and their
equivalents, therefore it is called the doer of the production of non-existence
(production of the non-existent). - All this is flawless (blameless,
unobstructed, uncontradictory) because it is stated from the secondary nature of
one of the substances and the primary nature of the other. It is as follows:
When the jiva is intended from the secondary nature of the astikaya and the
primary nature of the substance, then it (1) is not produced, (2) is not
destroyed, (3) does not function in sequence, therefore it does not destroy the
existing (present) group of astikayas and (4) does not produce the non-existent
(non-existent group of astikayas). And when the jiva is intended from the
secondary nature of the substance and the primary nature of the astikaya, then
it (1) is produced, (2) is destroyed, (3) destroys the existing (present) group
of astikayas whose time has passed, and (4) produces the non-existent (non-
existent group of astikayas) whose time has arrived (has come). This grace is
truly of the Anekantavada, that even such contradiction (truly) is not
contradiction. ||21|| Thus, the general description of the six substances is
complete.

The meaning is that the soul, due to the cause of the destruction of the
existing and the creation of the non-existent *paryaya*, should continuously and
with utmost earnestness have right faith, knowledge, and conduct in the pure
soul substance. ||21||  Thus, in the fourth place, the *gatha* has been
included, mainly for the purpose of explaining the creation and destruction of
the soul in the form of a god or human being, even though it is eternal
according to the *dravya* theory, but according to the *paryaya* theory. This
completes the second *saptaka* with these four places.  Thus, the second
*antaradhikari* called *dravya-pithika* in the *mahaadhikari* of *jayabhitta*
ends with the five places mentioned in the first *gatha-spataka*, excluding the
*jayabhitta* and *aneshalatha*.  **Hindi Meaning:**  The *gatha* 21 further
clarifies that the soul is the creator of the destruction of the existing
*paryaya* and the creation of the non-existent *paryaya* within itself, and also
explains this concept.  **General Meaning with Anvaya:**  In this way, the soul,
along with its qualities and *paryayas*, wanders in the world, creating and
destroying, initiating the absence of the existing *paryaya* and the presence of
the non-existent *paryaya*.  **Specific Meaning:**  As we have already said, the
soul is eternal according to the *dravya* theory, but according to the *paryaya*
theory, it destroys the existing human *paryaya* and then creates the god
*paryaya* at the time of birth in the heavenly realm. Even then, at the time of
the end of the god *paryaya*, it initiates the destruction of the existing god
*paryaya* and the creation of the non-existent human *paryaya* at the time of
birth in the human realm. The soul that does this is accompanied by qualities
like wrong knowledge, etc., and *paryayas* like human, hellish, etc. The soul
that is accompanied by natural qualities like perfect knowledge, etc., and the
pure *paryaya* of the liberated soul, does not wander in this way, because the
creation of human, hellish, etc., *paryayas* is impossible when the light of
perfect knowledge, etc., is present. However, even in the pure liberated soul
*paryaya*, the soul continues to create and destroy, etc., due to the qualities
of heavy and light, in relation to the six-fold *paryaya* of the nature of gain
and loss. There is no contradiction in this. When the soul is impure, it wanders
in the world in the form of five types: substance, field, time, existence, and
state. This *sutra* shows that when the soul attains the pure soul substance in
the form of pure knowledge, vision, and nature, it should have right faith,
knowledge, and conduct in the form of the three jewels of certainty, which is
the supreme *samayik*.

## 78 ## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  A being who does
not perceive, hear, or experience the four types of knowledge - food, fear,
sexual intercourse, and possessions - and who is deluded, confused, or attached
to the results of all influences, is constantly born and destroyed in the
various categories of beings like humans and hell beings. Such a being should
strive to maintain pure soul substance, right faith, knowledge, and experience
or meditation, so that there is no wandering in the realms of influence. This is
the meaning. || 21 ||  In this way, although the substances are eternal
according to the substance-based perspective, according to the category-based
perspective, this worldly being is the creator and destroyer of the categories
of beings like gods and humans. This explanation is mainly due to the
contraction of the fourth stage, and the chapter is complete. In this way, the
second set of seven chapters is completed with four stages. Thus, the second
internal chapter called "Dravyapithika" in the first great chapter is completed
with fourteen chapters, including the five stages mentioned in the first set of
seven chapters and nine internal stages.  ## Time Commentary Verse - 22  Here,
among the six substances whose characteristics have been generally described,
the five are established as Astikayas. The soul, the pudgala, the space, and the
remaining two Astikayas are non-created, existentially real, and are the cause
of the world. || 22 ||  ## Hindi Time Commentary Verse - 22  Anvayaartha - [
Jeevaah ] Soul ( Pugalakaayaah ) Pudgala ( Aakaasam ) Space and [ Shesh Astikaya
] the remaining two Astikayas ( Amayaah ) are non-created, ( Astitvamyaah )
existentially real, and ( hi ) truly ( Lokasya Kaaranabhootaaah ) are the cause
of the world.  Tika - Here (in this verse), among the six substances whose
nature has been (previously) described, five are established as Astikayas.
Because they are non-created, existentially real, and the cause of the diversely
evolving world, it is accepted that among the six substances, the soul, pudgala,
space, dharma, and adharma are Astikayas. Time is not an Astikaya because it
does not exist. This is understood through the power of reasoning. || 122 ||

The five Astikayas are: Jiva, Pudgala, Akasa, Dharma and Adharma. These are
accepted (Sammat) because they are not created (Akrit), they exist (Astitvamya)
and they are caused by the Lokas which are of various types and are their
culmination. The five Astikayas are characterized by being composed of a
collection of Pradeshas (Pradeshaprachayatmak). Time (Kal) is not composed of a
collection of Pradeshas, therefore it is not an Astikaya. This is certain
(Nischita) by inference (Samarthya). ||22||

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas with Anvaya and General
Meaning:  (Jiva) Infinite Jivas (Puggala-kaya) Infinite Puggala-kayas (Aayasam)
One Akasa (Sesa Astikaiya) The remaining two Astikayas, Dharma and Adharma, are
the substances. These five Astikayas (Amaya) are not created, (Asthitt-maya)
they exist by their own nature, and (Hi) certainly (Logass) are the
(Karanabhuuda) cause of this Lok.  ## Specific Meaning:  Jiva and the other five
Astikayas are not created by any particular person. They exist by their own
nature and are therefore present. This Lok is a combination of these five
Astikayas, a space without a body, and the substance of time, making a total of
six substances. As it is said, "Jivaadi-shad-dravyaanam samavaayo melapako
lokah". This Lok is characterized by creation, destruction, and permanence. This
is how the existence of this Lok is observed, as it is said, "Utpada-vyaya-
dhrauvya-yuktam sat iti". This Lok has three parts: above, middle, and below. It
is also made up of many parts and is therefore called "bahu-pradeshi" or "kaya-
pana". This is the meaning of the sutra.  ## Conclusion:  This way, the
information about the five Astikayas, Jiva and the others, being among the six
substances is conveyed, and the verse is completed.  ## Time Explanation:  ##
Verse 23:  Even though time is not mentioned as an Astikaya, its existence is
implied. The Jivas and Puggala are characterized by their existence and nature.
Time, born from change, is defined by rule.  ## Explanation:  Since Jivas and
Puggala exist by their own nature, there is a continuous change in them,
characterized by creation, destruction, and permanence. This change is observed
in the presence of the cause of cooperation. It is like the change in motion,
stillness, understanding, and transformation. The cause of cooperation is time.
Since this change cannot be explained without time, it is certain that time
exists even though it is not mentioned. The time used in everyday life is
synonymous with the definite time. It is understood to be dependent on the
change in Jivas and Puggala, as it is manifested by them.

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):  The Pañcāstikāya Prābhṛta
Commentary on the Verse 23 of the Samayasāra - Meaning of the Verse
(sattāsvabhāvānām) Of the beings (jīvānām tathā eva pudgalānām ca) as well as
the matter (pudgalānām), the time (kālaḥ) that is produced by
(parivarttanasambhūtaḥ) the transformation is (niyamena prajñaptaḥ) ascertained
by the omniscient ones.  Explanation - Even though the time (kāla) is not
explicitly mentioned as an astikāya (substance), its existence is established
here. In this world, the beings (jīvas) and the matter (pudgalas) are constantly
undergoing transformation (utpādavyayadhrauvya) due to their intrinsic nature
(sattāsvabhāva). This transformation is like the motion, stability, and
penetration. This transformation, which is the cooperative cause, is known as
time (kāla). Even though the time (kāla) is not explicitly mentioned, it is
established to exist in the form of substance, as it is necessary for the
transformation of the jīvas and pudgalas. The conventional time, which is in the
form of moments (samaya) and hours (ghaṭikā), is known through the
transformation of the jīvas and pudgalas, and hence, it is considered to be
dependent on them.

## 82. ## Description of the Six Substances - Five Astikayas  Just as the
thread-bundle is the material cause of the cloth, which is produced by the cause
of the cloth, and the rice, etc., is the material cause of the cooked rice,
etc., which is produced by the cause of the cooked rice, etc., similarly, the
living being is the material cause of the body, etc., which is produced by the
cause of the body, etc. || 23 ||  **Hindi Meaning Commentary Verse - 23**
Further, it is said that in the context of the five Astikayas, even though the
time substance is not mentioned by name, it is still obtained by the power of
the context of the five Astikayas.  **General Meaning with Anvaya**
(Sabbhavasabhavanaam) Those who possess the nature of being (jivaanam) living
beings, (tah ya poggalaanam) similarly, the particles, (cha) and other dharma,
adharma, and space, (pariyattan sambhudo) the cause of their transformation,
(niyamen) is definitely (kaalo) the time substance (pannatto) is said to be.
**Specific Meaning**  The transformation or change from new to old of substances
is called transformation. The cause of this is the time substance. This is what
the omniscient God has said. Here, the student doubts that this is a discussion
of the Patanika, or whether this is a discussion of the five Astikayas, and even
though the time substance is not mentioned, it should be understood by
implication. How is this proven? The Acharya answers that these five Astikayas,
including the living being, are constantly transforming. This transformation
results in a transformed or changed form. This transformed form depends on its
cause. Although the power of the material cause is inherent in the substances
themselves to transform, there is a need for an efficient cause. Therefore, the
time substance, in the form of the time atom, is the efficient cause of the
transformation of substances. It is by the power of this logic that the time
substance is revealed.  The student then presents this counter-argument: The
subtle time, which is produced by the movement of the particle atoms, is called
the definite time. The gross time, which is in the form of hours, minutes, etc.,
is called the practical time. This practical time is produced by the actions of
men, such as filling water, making vessels, clothes, and wood, which are the
efficient causes of hours, minutes, etc. There is no practical time from the
time substance.  The Acharya answers this by saying that although the subtle
practical time, in the form of time, is revealed by the slow movement of the
particle atoms, and the gross practical time, in the form of hours, minutes,
etc., is known by the actions of the substances, such as water, vessels,
clothes, etc., which are the efficient causes of hours, minutes, etc.,
nevertheless, the practical time, which is in the form of time or hours,
minutes, etc., is the material cause of the time substance, in the form of the
time atom. This is what we should believe.

## Translation:  **Panchaastikaya** is derived from the principle that the
effect is similar to the material cause. Just as a pot, the effect, is formed by
the external instrumental causes like the potter, wheel, and cloth, its material
cause is the lump of clay. Similarly, a cloth, the effect, is formed by the
external instrumental causes like the weaver, loom, thread, and shuttle, its
material cause is the bundle of threads. Likewise, cooked rice, the effect, is
produced by the external instrumental causes like fuel and fire, its material
cause is rice or paddy. Or, the effect of the cycle of birth and death, like
human or hellish beings, is caused by the arising of karma, its material cause
is the soul. In the same way, the **time** that is manifested by the specific
actions of objects is the **time-atom** (**Kalaanu**), the material cause of the
**definite time** (**Nischya Kala**).  **Time Explanation Verse 24:**  **Time**
is devoid of five colors and five tastes, devoid of two smells and eight
touches, it is neither heavy nor light, it is formless, and it is characterized
by change.  **Hindi Explanation of Verse 24:**  **Time** (**Nischya Kala**) is
devoid of five colors and five tastes, devoid of two smells and eight touches,
it is neither heavy nor light, it is formless, and it is characterized by
change.  **Sanskrit Explanation of Verse 24:**  This verse further explains the
nature of **definite time**. It is devoid of five colors, five tastes, two
smells, and eight touches. It is neither heavy nor light, it is formless, and it
is characterized by change. This **time-atom** (**Kalaanu**) is the material
cause of **definite time**. It is like the wheel of a potter, which rotates
continuously, and the fire that helps in the process of learning. It is like the
stone beneath the wheel, which supports the wheel's rotation. It is the external
cause of change.   **Note:** The translation preserves the Jain terms like
**Panchaastikaya**, **Kalaanu**, and **Nischya Kala**.

## Six Substances - Description of the Five Astikayas  Just as a potter's wheel
moves everywhere, and just as when a touch is applied to one part of the body,
the sense of taste experiences pleasure throughout the entire body, and just as
when a snake bites one part of the body, pain is felt throughout the entire
body, similarly, even though it is present in the midst of the world, the time
substance pervades the entire universe. Why? Because it is an indivisible
substance. The time substance is the contributory cause of the transformation of
other substances. What is the contributory cause of the transformation of time?
Just as space is the support of space, and just as the light of knowledge, the
sun, and the moon illuminate themselves and others, similarly, time itself is
the contributory cause of the transformation of the time substance.  Some may
argue that just as the time substance is itself the contributory cause of its
own transformation, so too all other substances will be the contributory cause
of their own transformation, and what is the purpose of the time substance? To
address this, we say that the property of being the contributory cause of the
transformation of all substances is unique to time. How is this so? Just as
space provides space for all, and just as the dharma substance is the cause of
motion for all, similarly, dharma is the cause of the state of being for all.
How is this so? The qualities of one substance cannot be transferred to another
substance, as this would lead to the defect of mixing and interference.
Furthermore, if all substances are the contributory cause of their own
transformation, just as they are the material cause of their own transformation,
then what is the purpose of the dharma, adharma, and space substances in the
transformation of motion, state of being, and understanding? Motion, state of
being, and understanding will occur on their own. If this is the case, then what
is the fault in the two substances called the jiva and the pudgala? This would
contradict the scriptures.  Here, the pure jivas, whose nature is pure
perception-knowledge, have been exhausted in the cycle of existence for an
infinite period of time due to the absence of the astikaya of the pure jiva.
Therefore, having attained the state of freedom from attachment and the state of
equanimity, and having abandoned all attachment, thoughts, and the waves of
mental fluctuations, the jiva should constantly meditate on this. This is the
meaning.  This is the explanation of the time of certainty, which is the main
theme of these two verses.  **Hindi Meaning:**  The five colors and five tastes
are absent. The two smells and eight touches are absent. It is subtle due to its
formlessness and is not perceptible to the senses. It is characterized by its
nature of being a flow. This is the time substance.  **Specific Meaning:**  This
formless time substance is the cause of the transformation of all substances.
Just as fire is the contributory cause for a man reading in the winter, or just
as the stone below is the contributory cause for a potter's wheel spinning,
similarly, the time substance, which is characterized by its nature of being a
flow, is the external cause of the transformation of all substances that are
transforming on their own. This is the time of certainty.

The disciple asked, "If time substance is not outside the space substance, then
how will the space substance outside transform?" The Acharya replied, "Just as
by moving one part of a long rope, the whole rope moves, or by touching one part
of the body with the sense of touch, or by tasting with the tongue, the whole
body experiences pleasure, or by biting one part of a snake, the whole body
experiences pain, similarly, even though time substance is within the space
substance, it is the cause of transformation of the entire space substance
because space is a single, undivided substance."  The second question was, "If
time substance is the cooperative cause in the transformation of other
substances, then what is the cooperative cause of the transformation of time
substance?" The solution is, "Just as space is the basis of space, knowledge,
light, and a lamp are self-illuminating, similarly, time itself is the
cooperative cause of the transformation of time substance." Then the disciple
asked, "If time substance is the cooperative cause of its own transformation,
then all substances will become the cooperative cause of their own
transformation, and there will be no use of time substance."  The solution is,
"The ability of all substances to be the cooperative cause in their general
transformation is a quality of time. Just as the quality of space is to provide
space for all, the quality of dharma substance is to be the cause of movement
for all, and the quality of adharma substance is to be the cooperative cause of
stillness for all. This is because the qualities of one substance cannot be made
into the qualities of another substance. If this were to happen, there would be
the fault of mixture and interference. If all substances were to become the
cooperative cause while being the material cause of their own transformation,
then there would be no use of dharma, adharma, and space substances in the
actions of movement, stillness, and absorption. Movement, stillness, and
absorption would happen on their own. If this were to happen, it would be a
fault because only the jiva and pudgala substances would remain. This would
contradict the scriptures. The meaning here is that this jiva, who is inherently
pure knowledge and perception, and who is the pure jiva-astikaya, has been
wandering in the cycle of existence for an infinite time. Therefore, now it
should remain in the state of vitraga nirvikalpa samadhi, abandoning all waves
of attachment and aversion, and constantly meditate on that pure jiva."  Thus,
two verses are completed, mainly focusing on the explanation of time.

## Chapter 86: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  **Verse 25:
Explanation of Time**  Time, moment, *kaṣṭhā*, *kalā*, *nālī*, then day and
night. Month, season, solstice, and year - this is time, dependent on others.
**Commentary:**  Here, the dependence of practical time is shown.  Time is
dependent on the movement of atoms. A moment is dependent on the blinking of the
eye. *Kaṣṭhā*, *kalā*, and *nālī* are specific quantities of moments. Day and
night are dependent on the movement of the celestial bodies. Month, season,
solstice, and year are specific quantities of day and night.  Such practical
time cannot be understood as merely a synonym for time, as it is dependent on
other things. Therefore, it is described as "dependent."  **Hindi Explanation of
Verse 25:**  (Time) Time, (moment) moment, (*kaṣṭhā*) *kaṣṭhā*, (*kalā*) *kalā*,
(*nālī*) *nālī*. (Then day and night) day and night, (day), (month, season, and
year) month, season, and year. (This is time) such time (i.e., practical time)
(dependent on others) is dependent on others.  **Commentary:**  Here, the
dependence of practical time is shown.  Time is dependent on the movement of
atoms. A moment is dependent on the blinking of the eye. From a specific number
of moments, *kaṣṭhā*, *kalā*, and *nālī* are formed. Day and night are dependent
on the movement of the sun. From a specific number of day and night, month,
season, solstice, and year are formed.  Such practical time cannot be understood
as merely a synonym for time, as it is dependent on other things. Therefore, it
is described as "dependent."  **Sanskrit Meaning and Explanation of Verse 25:**
Now, in determining time and other practical time, the true meaning of time is
also revealed through the transformation of the soul, the *pudgala*, and the
*bhavana*. This shows that it is dependent on other things.  *Samaya* - Time is
manifested by the *pudgala* atoms that have undergone slow transformation.
*Nimisa* - A moment is manifested by the blinking of the eye. It is a time
beyond numbers.  *Kaṣṭhā* - Fifteen *nimisa* make a *kaṣṭhā*.  *Kalā* - Thirty
*kaṣṭhā* make a *kalā*.  *Nālī* - Twenty-four *kalā* make a *muhūrta* (two
*muhūrta* make a *ghaṭikā*).  *Then day and night* - Thirty *muhūrta* make a day
and night.  *Month* - Twenty days make a month.  *Season* - Two *udgāsa* make a
season.  *Solstice* - A solstice is caused by a season.  *Year* - Two solstices
make a year.  The word "iti" indicates that practical time is to be understood
as a metaphor, a simile, or an analogy. It is manifested by the slow
transformation of the *pudgala* atoms, the *ghaṭikā* is manifested by the
*pudgala* that is the cause of the water clock, and the day and night are
manifested by the specific actions of the sun's movement.

## 87  - - - - - - - The time of practical affairs is based on the five-fold
divisions (of time). How is it so? The lump of clay, which is produced by
external factors like the potter, etc., is dependent on others, and is said to
be dependent on others, being subject to others, even though it is generated by
the time of substance. Moreover, it is defined by specific actions like the
movement of the sun, etc., and is the cause of the definition of another's
birth, etc. That same time is different from the time of substance. Not so. The
time of practical affairs, which is defined by the movement of the sun, etc.,
which is synonymous with the previously mentioned time, etc., is the cause of
the time of substance, which is defined by the movement of the sun, etc.   Now,
if the substance of dharma is the co-operative cause of the movement of the sun,
etc., what is the purpose of time? Not so. The substance of dharma is the co-
operative cause of the movement, and the substance of time also has many co-
operative causes. Just as the potter, wheel, cloth, etc., are the causes of the
creation of a pot, just as water, etc., are the causes of fish, etc., just as a
cart, etc., are the causes of humans, just as mantras, medicines, etc., are the
causes of the knowledge of the celestial beings, just as a chariot is the cause
of the gods, etc., so too is the substance of time the cause of movement. Where
is it said? It is said further, "The living beings, who are the bodies of the
poggala, are active due to the time-making."  Now, if the time taken to cross
one region by a single atom is the definition of time, then how many regions are
crossed in the time of fourteen rajjus, which is one time? Not so. The
generation of time, which is said to be due to the crossing of one region, is
said to be due to slow movement, and the crossing of fourteen rajjus, which is
said to be one time, is said to be due to fast movement. There is no fault in
this. An example is given here: Just as a certain Devadatta travels one hundred
yojanas in one hundred days, and he travels one hundred yojanas in one day due
to the power of knowledge, so too, in the case of fast movement, the crossing of
fourteen rajjus in one time is not a fault.

The description of the six substances and the five astikayas is as follows: A
month is made up of two months, a season is made up of three months, an ayan is
made up of three seasons, a year is made up of two ayans, and so on. One should
know the practical time periods like palya, upam, sagar, etc. Time is that which
manifests from the subtle particles of pudgala, which are in a state of slow
motion. A ghadi is that which manifests from the action of pudgala, which is
external and instrumental, like a vessel of water. A day, etc., is that which
manifests from the specific action of the sun's orb, like its movement, etc.
Just as a pot, which is produced by external instrumental causes like a potter's
wheel, etc., is born from the material cause, which is a lump of clay,
similarly, this practical time is born from the subtle particles of time, but it
is dependent on the movement of the moon, etc., as its instrumental cause. Here,
someone may doubt that time is that which is known by the specific action of
others, i.e., by the movement of the sun, etc., and which is the cause of
knowing other things that have been produced. There is no other substance or
definite time. The answer to this is that it is not so. The time that manifests
from the movement of the sun, etc., which is a synonym of the previously
mentioned evidence, is practical time, but the time that is a cooperative cause
in the movement of the sun, etc., is the substance time or definite time. Then
the doubter says that dharma substance is a cooperative cause in the movement,
etc., of the sun. What is the role of time substance here? The Acharya answers
that it is not so. Just as dharma substance is a cooperative cause in the
movement, so is time substance. There can be many cooperative causes. For
example, in the production of a pot, there are many causes like the potter, the
wheel, the chisel, etc., and for fish, there is water, etc., and for humans,
there is a cart, etc., and for students, there are mantras, medicines, etc., and
for gods, there are vehicles for movement, etc., which are cooperative causes.
Similarly, time substance is also a cooperative cause in movement. It has been
said somewhere that the skandhas made from pudgala and the living being along
with pudgala are active only because of time. This will be discussed further.
The doubter doubts that the time taken by a pudgala particle to cross a region
is time. It has been said that the same particle travels fourteen rajus in the
same time. How can the same time be taken when it crosses fourteen rajus, which
are equal to fourteen regions? The Acharya resolves this by saying that it is
not so. When a particle crosses a region while moving slowly, one time is
produced. The same particle crosses fourteen rajus in the same time, but it does
so at a faster speed. This is what has been said, so there is no fault in this.
There are no divisions of time. An example is given here. A man named Devadatta
travels one hundred yojanas in one hundred days at a slow speed. If he travels
with the power of knowledge,

If one were to travel to the Panchaastikaya in a day, one would say it took a
hundred days, but in reality, it takes only one day. Similarly, when traveling
at high speed, even fourteen Rajus can be traversed in a single moment, there is
no fault in this.  **Time Explanation Verse 26**  Neither long nor short is
without measure, indeed, it is measure. Without the pudgala substance,
therefore, time is dependent on perception.  **Commentary:**  Here, the
dependence of practical time on something else is explained well. Firstly, in
practical time, like the blink of an eye, there is the perception of "long" and
"short". This perception is indeed dependent on the measure of long and short
time, which is not possible without that measure. And that measure is not
determined without the transformation of the pudgala substance. Therefore,
because practical time is known through the transformation of something else,
although it is not dependent on anything else in terms of certainty, it is said
to be dependent on perception.  Here, in the general description of the
Panchaastikaya, although it is not directly mentioned because of its nature as
the Panchaastikaya, it is certain that it is dependent on the transformation of
the jiva and pudgala, and therefore, it is practical time, dependent on that
transformation. It is understood that time, like the Panchaastikaya, has
transformed into the form of the world, from a very subtle perspective.  Thus,
the section on the general explanation of the Panchaastikaya, which is part of
the explanation of time, is complete.  **Hindi Explanation of Verse 26**
Meaning: (Chiram va kshipram) "Chiram" or such knowledge (long time or other
time, such knowledge) (matrarahitam tu) without measure (without measure of
time) (na asti) does not exist, (sa matra api) and that measure (khulu) truly
(pudgaladravyena vina) without the pudgala substance does not exist, (tasmat)
therefore (kalah pratitibhavah) time (practical time) is dependent on
perception.  Commentary: Here, the truth about the dependence of practical time
on something else is explained.  Firstly, in practical time, like the blink of
an eye, there is the perception of "long" and "short" (long time and short time,
such knowledge). That knowledge is truly dependent on the measure of long and
short time, which is not possible without that measure. And that measure is not
determined without the transformation of the pudgala substance. Therefore,
because practical time is known through the transformation of something else,
although it is not dependent on anything else in terms of certainty, it is said
to be dependent on perception.

## Six Substances and Five Astikayas Explained  Therefore, although there is no
direct statement here about the general form of Astikaya due to the absence of
Astikaya in the time-cycle, it can be known with very sharp vision that the
definite time, which is proven by the non-existence of other possibilities of
the results of Jiva and Pudgala, and the practical time, which is definitely
dependent on the results of the former, are transformed into the form of the
world, like the five Astikayas. || 26 ||  Thus ends the preface in the form of a
general explanation of the six substances and five Astikayas in the commentary
called "Time Explanation".  **Verse 26 of the Sanskrit Tatparya Vritti**  Now,
in the previous verse, it was stated that the practical time is somehow
dependent on the ultimate reality. How is this possible? This is explained in
the following:  "Natthi" means "not there", "not existing". What is "Chira"
(long) or "Kshrip" (short)? "Chira" is the form of a longer duration, "Kshrip"
is the form of a shorter duration. How is this? "Matta-rahiya" means "without
measure", "without quantity", "without specific value". The quantity denoted by
the word "Matra" (measure) is the duration of "Chira" (long) like "Ghatika"
(hour), "Prahara" (watch), etc. The quantity denoted by the word "Matra"
(measure) for "Kshrip" (short) is the duration of "Sookshma Kala" (subtle time).
What is this? It is like "Samaya Avali" (sequence of time).  "The measure of
"Sookshma Kala" (subtle time) like "Samaya" (time) etc., without the Pudgala
substance, is not known. Similarly, the measure like "Ghatika" (hour) etc., of
"Chira Kala" (long time), without the Pudgala substance, which is the cause of
the subtle time, is not known. Similarly, the measure like "Ghatika" (hour)
etc., of "Chira Kala" (long time), without the substance like the water vessel,
which is the cause of "Ghatika" (hour), is not known. Therefore, due to this
reason, the practical time, which is in the form of "Samaya" (time), "Ghatika"
(hour), "Sookshma" (subtle), and "Sthula" (gross), although it is a synonym of
the definite time, is said to be born, produced, by depending on and taking the
Pudgala substance like atoms, water, etc., as the cause."  What is the example?
Just as a pot, although it is born from the Pudgala mass as the material cause,
is said to be made by the potter because it is born from the potter as the
efficient cause, similarly, the practical time like "Samaya" (time) etc.,
although it is born from the ultimate time as the material cause, is said to be
born from Pudgala because it is manifested, made known, by the Pudgala substance
like atoms, water, etc., which are the cause of "Samaya" (time) and "Ghatika"
(hour).  Again, someone may say, "There is only the ultimate time in the form of
"Maya" (illusion), and there is no other time in the form of substance."  To
this, the refutation is given: "Samaya" (time) is known as "Sookshma Kala"
(subtle time), and this is a synonym, not a substance. How is it a synonym?
Because it is born and destroyed. The scripture says, "Samayo Uppanna-Paddhansi"
(Time is born and destroyed). A synonym cannot exist without a substance, and a
substance is eternally indestructible. Therefore, the substance of time, which
is the material cause of the synonym of time, is the time substance itself, not
Pudgala etc. Why is this? Because the effect is similar to the material cause,
just as a pot, which is the effect, is born from the clay mass, which is the
material cause.  Furthermore, the specific time itself is the one that denotes
the ultimate time and establishes, proves, the form of the ultimate time, which
is its own denotation. How is this? Just as the word "Simha" (lion) denotes the
lion, the word "Sarvajña" (omniscient) denotes the omniscient, the word "Indra"
(Indra) denotes Indra, and so on.  Again, the form of the definite time and the
practical time is explained in the form of a conclusion. For example, although
the time, which is the material cause, is the same for the subtle practical time
like "Samaya" (time) and the gross practical time like "Ghatika" (hour), it is
devoid of the distinction of practical time, which is intended in the form of
"Samaya" (time) and "Ghatika" (hour), and it is established in the three times,
without beginning and end, ...

21 The ultimate time is in the form of the substance of the infinitesimal
particles of the space-like region, beginning with the five-astikayas. However,
the time that is to be understood as the form of the practical time, such as the
moment, day, etc., is the practical time, because it is dependent on the
infinitesimal particles of the substance, such as water vessels, etc., which are
generated by the fire of the cause of the definitive time. This explanation
implies that in this infinite time, the yogis who are the life of the five-
astikayas should have firm faith in the one time nature of knowledge and bliss,
distinct knowledge of the form of the five-astikayas, distinct from passion,
etc., and a steady mind by abandoning the entire network of thoughts and doubts
in the form of passion, etc., and should remain in that state. ||26|| Thus, two
verses have been devoted to the explanation of practical time. In this first
great chapter, which includes the explanation of the six substances of the five-
astikayas, the explanation of the definitive and practical time has been
explained in three places in five verses. Thus, the five-astikaya pithika is
completed with twenty-six verses in three chapters, namely the time-word
pithika, the substance pithika, and the explanation of the definitive and
practical time. Hindi meaning of verse 26: In the previous verses, the practical
time has been said to be dependent on something. How is it dependent? Let us
understand this with logic. General meaning with analysis: Without measure or
quantity, there is no practical time, whether it is long or short. Certainly,
that measure also does not exist without the substance of the pudgala.
Therefore, time is said to be caused by the pudgala. Specific meaning: Long time
is called chira and short time is called kshipra. In the world, the practical
time of chira or kshipra cannot be without a limit. When we call the time of a
ghadi, prahar, etc., chira, then the time smaller than that is called kshipra.
The subtle time is a time that is not known without the infinitesimal particles
of the pudgala, which are changing slowly. The time that is just a nimisha is
not known without the blinking of the eye. Chira time, ghadi, etc., are not
known without the substance of water vessels, etc., which are the cause of
ghatika, etc. Therefore, the practical time, whether subtle or gross, in the
form of ghatika, etc., is a synonym of the time substance in the definitive
sense, but in practice, it is said to be generated by the substance of the
pudgala, such as the infinitesimal particles and water, etc., as its support or
cause. Just as a pot, which is generated from the substance of the earth in the
form of a pudgala lump in the definitive sense, is said to be made by the potter
in practice because it is made by the potter, similarly, the practical time,
such as time, etc., is generated from the pudgala in practice because it is
manifested by the infinitesimal particles, which are the cause of time, or by
the water, etc., which are the cause of ghatika, etc., although it is generated
from the ultimate time substance in the definitive sense. Then someone said...

## Translation:  **Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas**  At
the time of describing the transactional time, is there no substance in the form
of the definitive time, the time atom? To this, the Acharya says that time is a
synonym known as the most subtle form of time, it is not a substance. It is a
synonym because time arises and perishes. It is said, "Time arises and
perishes." A synonym cannot exist without a substance. A substance is definitely
imperishable, therefore, the time atom in the form of the substance is the
causal basis of the time synonym, not the pudgala, etc. Because it is a rule
that the effect is like the causal basis, just as a lump of clay will be, so
will the pot made from it be similar to its causal basis. And what else? The
word "time" itself, being the denoter of the ultimate time, establishes the
nature of its own denotation, the ultimate time. Just as the word "lion" proves
the lion substance, the word "omniscient" proves the omniscient substance, and
the word "Indra" proves the Indra substance. Still, while being hesitant, the
nature of definitive and transactional time is explained.  The subtle
transactional time, in the form of time, etc., and the gross transactional time,
in the form of hours, etc., whatever their causal basis may be, and which is
devoid of the conceptualization of transactional time due to the distinction of
time, hours, etc., and which is the distinct substance in the form of countless
time atoms, the measure of countless regions of the infinite space of the
endless lokas, existing in all three times, is the definitive time. And that
which, though born from the causal basis of the definitive time, manifests
itself in the pudgala atom, water vessel, etc., is the transactional time, which
comes into the conceptualization of specific transactions in the form of time,
hours, days, etc. The implication of this explanation is that one should have
complete faith in the pure jiva astikaya, which has been rare in the infinite
past, in its single nature of pure bliss, and one should know it to be different
from attachment, etc., and attain the knowledge of distinction, and in it alone,
one should remain steadfast, abandoning the net of all thoughts and choices,
which are the forms of attachment, etc.  In this way, two chapters are
completed, mainly due to the explanation of transactional time.  In the first
great chapter, which describes the five astikayas and the six substances, with
eight internal chapters, the third internal chapter is completed with five
chapters, through three locations, which speak of the definitive and
transactional time. In this way, the preface is completed with thirty-six
chapters, through three internal chapters, mainly due to the explanations of the
time word-preface, the substance preface, and the definitive and transactional
time.

##  Translation:  **1** **Panchaastikaya Prabhrut** **Samaya Vyakhya Gatha -
27**  Now, a special explanation of these (the six substances and the five
astikayas) is given. First, the explanation of the jiva astikaya.
**Anvayaartha:** (Jiva iti bhavati) The soul is a jiva, (chetayita) a knower,
(upayogavisesita) characterized by its function, (prabhu) a lord, (karta) a
doer, (bhokta) an enjoyer, (dehamaatra) limited to the body, (na hi moorta) not
material, (cha) and (karmasamyukta) connected with karma.  **Tika:** Here (in
this gatha), the sopadhi and nirupadhi nature of the soul in the state of
samsara is described.  The soul is called 'jiva' because it holds the life
principle (bhavaprana) in reality, and because it holds the material life
principle (dravya prana) in practice. It is called 'chetayita' (knower) because
it is essentially consciousness (chit) in reality, and because it has the power
of consciousness (chichhakti) in practice. It is called 'upayogavisesita'
(characterized by its function) because it is marked by its function, which is
the manifestation of consciousness (chaitanyaparinamalakshana), in practice, and
because it is distinct from the body. It is called 'prabhu' (lord) because it is
the master of its own actions (bhavakarma) in reality, and because it is the
master of its own material actions (dravya karma) in practice, in the binding,
covering, shedding, and liberation of karma. It is called 'karta' (doer) because
it is the doer of the soul's transformations (atmaparinama) caused by karmic
actions (paugalikakarma) in reality, and because it is the doer of karmic
actions (paugalikakarma) caused by the soul's transformations (atmaparinama) in
practice. It is called 'bhokta' (enjoyer) because it is the enjoyer of the
happiness and sorrow (sukhaduhkhaparinama) caused by good and bad karma
(shubhaashubhakarma) in reality, and because it is the enjoyer of the desired
and undesired objects (ishtaanishtavishaya) obtained by good and bad karma
(shubhaashubhakarma) in practice. It is called 'dehamaatra' (limited to the
body) because it is limited to the body in practice, although it is capable of
experiencing the world (lokamaatra) and has the power to transform itself
(visishtavagahparinama shakti), and because it resides in a body (sharira) made
of atoms (anu) and is large (mahach). It is called 'na hi moorta' (not material)
because it is not material in reality, although it is material (moorta) in
practice, because it is united with karma (karmabhi sahaiktatvaparinam). It is
called 'karmasamyukta' (connected with karma) because it is connected with karma
(karmabhi samyuktatva) in reality, because it is connected with karma (karmabhi
samyuktatva) through the soul's transformations (chaitanyaparinam) that are in
accordance with the karmic transformations (pulaparinama), and because it is
connected with karma (karmabhi samyuktatva) in practice, because it is connected
with the karmic transformations (pulaparinama) that are in accordance with the
soul's transformations (chaitanyaparinam).  **93** **I**  **Hindi Samaya Vyakhya
- 27**  Now, a special explanation of these (the six substances and the five
astikayas) is given. First, the explanation of the jiva astikaya.
**Anvayaartha:** (Jiva iti bhavati) The soul is a jiva, (chetayita) a knower,
(upayogavisesita) characterized by its function, (prabhu) a lord, (karta) a
doer, (bhokta) an enjoyer, (dehamaatra) limited to the body, (na hi moorta) not
material, (cha) and (karmasamyukta) connected with karma.  **Tika:** Here (in
this gatha), the sopadhi and nirupadhi nature of the soul in the state of
samsara is described.  The soul is called 'jiva' because it holds the life
principle (bhavaprana) in reality, and because it holds the material life
principle (dravya prana) in practice. It is called 'chetayita' (knower) because
it is essentially consciousness (chit) in reality, and because it has the power
of consciousness (chichhakti) in practice.

## 94 ## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  **The Soul
(Jiva)** is **"Chetayita"** (conscious) in practice, due to its possession of
the power of consciousness. It is **"Upayogalakshata"** (marked by use) in
certainty, due to being perceived through the use of its inherent nature as a
conscious entity. It is **"Upayogalakshata"** (marked by use) in practice, due
to being perceived through the use of its inherent nature as a conscious entity.
It is **"Prabhu"** (Lord) in certainty, due to being the self-sufficient cause
of the inflow (Asrava), bondage (Bandha), restraint (Samvara), outflow
(Nirjara), and liberation (Moksha) of the karmic activities (Bhavakarma). It is
**"Prabhu"** (Lord) in practice, due to being the self-sufficient cause of the
inflow (Asrava), bondage (Bandha), restraint (Samvara), outflow (Nirjara), and
liberation (Moksha) of the karmic activities (Dravyakarma). It is **"Karta"**
(Doer) in certainty, due to being the agent of the soul-modifications
(Atmaparinam) that are the cause of the karmic activities (Paugalikakarma). It
is **"Karta"** (Doer) in practice, due to being the agent of the soul-
modifications (Atmaparinam) that are the cause of the karmic activities
(Paugalikakarma). It is **"Bhokta"** (Experiencer) in certainty, due to being
the experiencer of the pleasant and unpleasant modifications
(Sukhaduhkhaparinam) that are the result of the auspicious and inauspicious
karmic activities (Shubhashubhakarma). It is **"Bhokta"** (Experiencer) in
practice, due to being the experiencer of the desired and undesired objects
(Istanisht) obtained through the auspicious and inauspicious karmic activities
(Shubhashubhakarma). It is **"Dehpraman"** (Body-proof) in practice, due to
residing in the small and large bodies created by the name karma, even though it
is the proof of the world (Lokpraman) and possesses the power of specific
perception (Vishistavagahaparinam). It is **"Amurta"** (Formless) in certainty,
due to its formless nature, even though it becomes manifest in practice due to
the unity modification (Ekatvaparinam) with the karmic activities (Karma). It is
**"Karmasanyukta"** (Combined with Karma) in certainty, due to being combined
with the karmic activities (Bhavakarma) of the conscious modifications
(Chaitanyaparinam) in accordance with the matter modifications (Pudgalaparinam).
It is **"Karmasanyukta"** (Combined with Karma) in practice, due to being
combined with the karmic activities (Karma) of the matter modifications
(Pudgalaparinam) in accordance with the conscious modifications
(Chaitanyaparinam). ||27||  **Verse 27 of the Sanskrit Commentary
(Tatparyavrittigaatha)**  Now, a detailed explanation of the aforementioned six
substances is given in the form of a summary. Thus:  "The Soul (Jiva) and Matter
(Pudgala) are the two substances that undergo modifications (Parinam), while the
remaining four substances (Dharma, Adharma, Akasha, Kala) are not subject to
modifications, as they are merely the means of manifestation (Vibhava) and
indication (Vyachana). The Soul (Jiva), in the pure certainty
(Shuddhanishchayanaya), is pure consciousness (Shuddhachaitanya) and is called
"Prana" (Life) due to its nature of pure knowledge and perception
(Shuddhajnandarshan). Therefore, it is called "Jiva" (Soul) in practice. The
Soul (Jiva) lives, will live, or has lived in the past, due to the four types of
life (Prana) that are the result of the arising of karma (Karmodaya) and are in
the form of matter (Dravyabhava). The five substances (Panchadravyas) - Matter
(Pudgala), etc. - are in the form of the Soul (Jiva). "Mutta" (Form) is the form
that is different from the formless pure self (Amurta Shuddhatma) and has the
qualities of touch, taste, smell, and color. Matter (Pudgala) is called "Murta"
(Form) due to the presence of this form. The Soul (Jiva) substance, although it
is manifest in practice due to the presence of the form, is formless (Amurta) in
pure certainty (Shuddhanishchayanaya). Dharma, Adharma, Akasha, and Kala
substances are also formless (Amurta). "Sapadeśa" (With Region) - The Soul
(Jiva) substance, which is characterized by an immeasurable number of regions
(Pradesha) as large as the world (Loka), is the first of the five substances
(Panchadravyas) and is called "Panchaastikaya" (Five Astikayas) with regions
(Sapradesha). The Kala (Time) substance, however, is without regions (Apradesha)
due to not being characterized by multiple regions (Bahupradesha). "Eya" (One) -
Dharma, Adharma, and Akasha substances are one in the sense of substance
(Dravyarthikanaya). The Soul (Jiva), Matter (Pudgala), and Kala (Time)
substances, however, are many. "Kheta" (Field) - Akasha (Space) is one field
(Kshetra) due to its ability to provide space (Avashadandanasamarthya) for all
substances. The remaining five substances are fields (Kshetra). "Kiriya"
(Action) - Action (Kriya) is the movement (Chalanavati) and vibration
(Parispandavati) in the form of movement from one field (Kshetra) to another.
The Soul (Jiva) and Matter (Pudgala) are active (Kriyavanti), while Dharma,
Adharma, Akasha, and Kala substances are inactive (Nishkriyani). "Niccha"
(Certain) - Dharma, Adharma, Akasha, and Kala substances, although they are
impermanent (Anitya) in the sense of their meaning (Arthaparyaya), are permanent
(Nitya) in the main sense (Mukhyavrittya) due to not being the means of
manifestation (Vibhava) and indication (Vyachana). The Soul (Jiva) and Matter
(Pudgala) substances, however, are impermanent (Anitya) in the sense of
substance (Dravyarthikanaya) in comparison to the main sense (Mukhyavrittya).

## 95  **Five Astikayas** are eternal, but in relation to the nature of their
transformation, which is characterized by heaviness and lightness, they are
impermanent. They are also impermanent in relation to the transformation of
their manifestation and expression. The five substances, namely, **pudgala**,
**dharma**, **adharma**, **akasha**, and **kala**, are the causes because they
perform actions such as the body, speech, mind, breath, and the activities of
going, staying, understanding, and revolving of the living being. The living
being substance, however, does not perform any action on the five substances,
**pudgala** etc., even though it interacts with them in the form of teacher and
student, etc. It is not a cause.  The living being is not the doer of **karma**
and its effects, such as **punya** and **papa**, which are the absence of the
substances of **bandha** and **moksha**, according to the pure substance-based
view, which is the view of the **katta** (doer) and the pure **parinaama**
(result) and the **param** (supreme) state. However, according to the impure
view, the living being, being transformed by the use of good and bad, becomes
the doer of **punya** and **papa** and the enjoyer of their fruits. When
transformed by the pure use, which is in the form of pure knowledge, pure
vision, pure nature, pure self-substance, right faith, right knowledge, and
right conduct, it becomes the doer of **moksha** and the enjoyer of its fruits.
It should be understood that the act of doing is the transformation of good,
bad, and pure results. The act of doing of the five substances, **pudgala**
etc., is their own transformation by their own nature. The act of not doing is
in the form of **punya** and **papa** etc., due to the activity of the
substance.  **Akasha** is said to be all-pervasive in relation to its
pervasiveness in the world and beyond the world. The living being substance is
all-pervasive in relation to its pervasiveness in the world, but it is not all-
pervasive in relation to each individual living being. It becomes all-pervasive
in relation to all living beings after abandoning the state of filling the
world. The **pudgala** substance is all-pervasive in relation to the great
**skandha** in the form of the world, but it is not all-pervasive in relation to
the rest of the **pudgala**. The **kala** substance is not all-pervasive in
relation to each **kalaanu** substance. It is all-pervasive in the world in
relation to the different **kalaanu** substances, which are the measure of the
region of the world.  It is also said that although all substances exist in
relation to each other through their mutual entry into each other's sphere of
activity, they do not abandon their own nature, which is conscious, unconscious,
etc., in reality. Among the six substances, the pure self-substance, which is
characterized by the qualities of freedom from attachment, pure consciousness,
and pure bliss, and is devoid of good and bad mental, verbal, and bodily
activities, is the only one that is worthy of being attained.  ## 1  From here
onwards, the special explanation of the five **astikayas** mentioned in the
**"Jiva Poggalakaya"** etc. **gatha** is given. There, the explanation of the
**Jiva Vastikaya** is begun with three **panchaash** **gatha** and nine
**antar** chapters in the order of the text. Among those three **panchaash**
**gatha**, the first one is the **"Jivothi Havdi Cheda"** etc. **gatha**, which
is the **sutr** **gatha** of one chapter, for the purpose of indicating the
order of the nine chapters, with the establishment of the living being first,
for the sake of the disciple who follows the **Charvaka** view.  The three
**shloka** **"Tatraadou Prabhuta Taavaj Jeevatvam Deha Maanata. Amoortatvam Cha
Chaitanyam Upayogaat Tatha Kramaat. 1. Kartritaa Bhoktrita Karmayuktatvam Cha
Trayam Tathaa. Khyate Yogapadhyena Yatra Tatra Anupoorvatha. 2."** indicate the
explanation of the chapters in order, with the establishment of the **sarvagna**
first, for the sake of the disciple who follows the **Bhatta** view.  First, the
explanation of **prabhutva** is the main one, and the two **gatha** **"Karam
Amal"** etc. are for the sake of the establishment of **sarvagna** for the
disciple who follows the **Bhatta Charvaka** view. After that, the three
**gatha** **"Paanehi Chaduhi"** etc. are for the sake of the establishment of
the living being for the disciple who follows the **Charvaka** view, in the form
of the explanation of **jeevatva**. Then, the two **sutr** **"Jah Paum"** etc.
are for the sake of establishing the living being as only its own body, for the
disciple who follows the **Nyaya**, **Mimamsa**, and **Samkhya** views. After
that, the three **sutr** **"Jesim Jiva Sahaavo"** etc. are for the sake of
explaining the formlessness of the living being, for the disciple who follows
the **Bhatta Charvaka** view. Then, the two **sutr** **"Kammaan Fal"** etc. are
for the sake of refuting the **Charvaka** view again, with the explanation of
the establishment of eternal consciousness. Thus, thirteen **gatha** are passed
with the **gatha** of the chapter at the beginning and the five chapters after
that. Then, for the sake of addressing the disciple who follows the **Nyaya**
view...

## Chapter 96: Description of the Sixfold Substance and the Fivefold Astika
**The use of the term "Uvaogo" is explained in the first nineteen verses.**
**In these nineteen verses, the first verse, "Uvaogo Khulu," indicates the two
uses of knowledge and perception.**  **The second verse, "Abhiṇi," explains the
eight types of knowledge.**  **The next five verses, starting with "Madinaṇ,"
describe the five types of perception.**  **The sixth verse, "Micchattā
Aṇṇāṇam," explains the three types of ignorance.**  **These eight verses
together constitute the verses on the use of knowledge.**  **The next verse,
"Dansaṇam Avi," primarily explains the four types of perception, including
sight.**  **Thus, the verses on the use of knowledge and perception are
completed with the first nine verses, which include five sections.**  **The next
ten verses establish the non-difference between the soul and knowledge, based on
their shared characteristics, purpose, and other distinctions, using the example
of fire and heat.**  **The nature of the soul and knowledge is explained.**
**The soul is defined as the substance that lives, will live, or has lived,
characterized by four breaths.**  **Knowledge is defined as the quality that
knows objects.**  **The purpose of the soul is to evolve through various stages,
including bondage and liberation, without being destroyed.**  **The purpose of
knowledge is to simply perceive objects.**  **These are the definitions and
purposes of the soul and knowledge in brief.**  **In these ten verses, the first
three verses, "Na Vi'appdi," briefly establish the non-difference between the
soul and knowledge.**  **The next three verses, "Vavadesa," argue that the
difference between substance and qualities is not a contradiction, even though
they are distinct.**  **The next two verses, "Na Hi So Samavāyāhim," refute the
concept of "Samavāya" (inherence), which is based on the idea that things are
present in the same place, like knowledge being present in the soul or cloth
being present in the threads.**  **The next two verses, "Vaṇṇarasa," provide an
example and explanation of the non-difference between a quality and its
possessor.**  **The definition of an example is: "An example is a thing that is
accepted without dispute by both the proponent and the opponent, like fire and
smoke, or the cause and effect, where the thing is present."**  **The definition
of a "Dāṭī" (analogy) is: "An analogy is a thing that is similar to the thing
being explained."**  **Thus, the first nine verses have five sections, and the
next ten verses have four sections, making a total of nine sections and nineteen
verses in this chapter.**  **The next eighteen verses explain the nature of pure
souls, which are free from attachment, filled with supreme bliss, and
characterized by perfect harmony and tranquility.**  **The first three verses,
"Jīvā Aṇāiṇihaṇā," explain the nature of pure souls in general.**  **The next
verse, "Udayeṇa," explains the five types of existence, including the arising of
the soul.**  **The next eight verses, "Kammam Vedayamāṇo," primarily explain the
nature of action.**  **The next verse, "Kamma Kamma Kuvvadi," presents an
opposing view.**  **The next seven verses refute the opposing view.**  **The
first three verses, "Ogāḍhagāḍha," firmly establish that the soul is not the
doer of actions.**  **The next verse, "Jīvā Poggalakāyā," firmly establishes
that the soul is the experiencer of the fruits of actions.**  **The next verse,
"Tamhā Kammam Kattā," summarizes the nature of the doer and the experiencer.**

The seven gāthās, starting with "Pancāstikāya prābhṛta tadanantaraṁ evaṁ kattā"
etc., explain karma-samyuktatva (being associated with karma) and karma-
rahitatva (being free from karma) in sequence. These gāthās are primarily meant
to address the issue of karma. Thus, with eighteen gāthās in five sections, the
text refutes the one-sided view and establishes the many-sided view. It also
aims to instruct the disciple who follows the Sāṃkhya philosophy regarding the
concept of kartṛtva (agency), the disciple who follows the Buddhist philosophy
regarding the concept of bhoktṛtva (enjoyment), and the disciple who follows the
Sadāśiva philosophy regarding the concept of karma-samyuktatva (being associated
with karma). Therefore, one should understand the three rights of agency,
enjoyment, and karma.  After explaining the rights related to the jīvā-stikāya
(soul-body), the three gāthās starting with "Ekko jem mahappā" etc. discuss the
jīvā-stikāya-cūlikā (the subtle body of the soul) and the first mahādhikāra
(major authority) related to the six substances of the pancāstikāya. The
remaining six antara-adhikāras (minor authorities) within the fourth antara-
adhikāra, which comprises 35 gāthās, discuss the destruction of the aggregates.
For example, the text explains the state of the soul in samsāra (cycle of birth
and death) in three ways: with pure certainty, with impure certainty, and with
the perception of the non-existent. With pure certainty, the soul is pure and
possesses the qualities of existence, consciousness, and knowledge. With impure
certainty, the soul is impure and possesses the qualities of karma, karma-phala
(fruits of karma), and attachment. With the perception of the non-existent, the
soul is impure due to the influence of karma and the substances.  The text then
explains the soul's existence in three ways: as jīva (living being), as cetanita
(conscious being), and as upayoga-viseṣita (being with specific use). The soul
is jīva because it possesses the qualities of existence, consciousness, and
knowledge with pure certainty, the qualities of karma, karma-phala, and
attachment with impure certainty, and the qualities of substances with the
perception of the non-existent. The soul is cetanita because it possesses pure
consciousness with pure certainty and impure consciousness with impure
certainty. The soul is upayoga-viseṣita because it possesses pure use with pure
certainty and impure use with impure certainty.  The text further explains the
soul's existence in three ways: as prabhu (lord), as kartā (agent), and as
bhoktā (enjoyer). The soul is prabhu because it possesses the power to transform
into pure states with pure certainty and impure states with impure certainty.
The soul is kartā because it is the agent of pure states with pure certainty,
impure states with impure certainty, and the perception of the non-existent. The
soul is bhoktā because it enjoys pure happiness with pure certainty, impure
happiness and suffering with impure certainty, and external objects with the
perception of the non-existent.  The text also explains the soul's existence in
three ways: as sadeha-metta (having a body), as amūrta (formless), and as karma-
samyukta (associated with karma). The soul is sadeha-metta because it possesses
a body due to the influence of karma. The soul is amūrta because it is formless
with pure certainty and possesses a body due to the influence of karma with the
perception of the non-existent. The soul is karma-samyukta because it is free
from karma with pure certainty, associated with karma with the perception of the
non-existent, and associated with karma with impure certainty.  The text then
explains the meaning of the words and the meaning of the doctrine. The
explanation of jīvatva (being a living being) is based on the nine examples
mentioned in the Dohaka Sūtra, which states: "Vachchakkharaṁ bhava-sārittya-
samga-niraya-piyarāya. Cullīya-haṇḍayi-puṇa-mavaū ṇa ḍiṭuṁtā jāya." This
explanation aims to prove the existence of all living beings and to explain the
quality of anadi-cetanā (eternal consciousness) from the perspective of the
disciple who follows the Cārvāka philosophy. Alternatively, the explanation of
asāmanya-cetanā (non-ordinary consciousness) should be understood as common to
all philosophies. The explanation of abhinna-jñāna-darśana-upayoga (undivided
knowledge, vision, and use) is meant to instruct the disciple who follows the
Naiyāyika philosophy. The explanation of prabhu-tva (lordship) is meant to teach
about mokṣa (liberation) and the means to achieve it. The statement of the
liberated and omniscient being is the proof.

## 98 **Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas**  "The six
substances are: **rayan**, **divdi**, **nayaru**, **unduda**, **upasanu**,
**sun**, **rupp**, **phalhiu**, **agani**, **nav**, **ditu**, **janu**."  This
is the explanation of the nine examples mentioned in the **Dohaka Sutra**. It is
meant to establish the omniscience of the **Jina** in comparison to the
disciples who follow the **Bhatta Charvaka** philosophy. The explanation of the
**karma** and its effects, both pure and impure, is meant for the disciples who
follow the **Nitya-Kartṛtva-Ekanta-Sankhya** philosophy. The explanation of
**bhoktṛtva** (enjoyment) is meant for the disciples who follow the **Buddhist**
philosophy, as it clarifies that the doer does not enjoy the fruits of his
actions. The explanation of **svadēha-pramāṇa** (self-evidence) is meant to
dispel the doubts of the disciples who follow the **Nyaya**, **Mimamsa**, and
**Kapila** philosophies. The explanation of **amūrtatva** (immateriality) is
meant for the disciples who follow the **Bhatta Charvaka** philosophy. The
explanation of the **karma** being combined with the **dravya** (substance) and
**bhāva** (state) is meant to refute the **Sadā-Mukta** (ever-liberated)
philosophy.  The meaning of the **āgama** (scripture) is well-known in the
**paramāgama** (supreme scripture) due to its connection with **jīrva**,
**tva**, **cetana**, and other **dharma** (qualities). One should contemplate
the **śuddha-jīva-astikāya** (pure soul body) with the qualities of
**nirūpādhika-kevala-jñāna** (unconditioned omniscience) etc., by abandoning all
**vibhāva** (modifications) like **kopa** (anger), **āśvi** (jealousy),
**mithyā** (false), **rāga** (attachment), etc.  This is the meaning of the
**śabda-naya** (verbal interpretation) and **āgama-bhāva** (scriptural meaning).
These should be understood wherever possible during the explanation.  **Why the
explanation of the Jīva-astikāya-samudāya (community of soul bodies) is repeated
after the previous explanation of the Charvaka and others?**  The disciple
raises this objection in the **pūrvapksha** (previous argument). The **parihar**
(refutation) is as follows:  When the **vītarāga** (free from attachment) and
**sarvajña** (omniscient) are established, the explanation becomes a **pramāṇa**
(proof). Therefore, the **adhikāra-navaka** (nine authorities) is mentioned to
indicate the order of the explanation and the **prabhuta** (authority) and
**adhikāra** (right).  It is said: "The authority of the word comes from the
authority of the speaker."  Here, since the **dharma** (qualities) are
established in the **dharmi** (possessor of qualities), the explanation of the
**dharma** like **cetana-guṇa** (consciousness) etc., which are the **viśēṣaṇa**
(qualifiers) of the **viśēṣya** (qualified) and the **lakṣya** (object) **jīva**
(soul) as the **dharmi** (possessor of qualities), is established. Therefore,
the **adhikāra-navaka** (nine authorities) is mentioned along with the
refutation of other philosophies, after establishing the **jīva** (soul), to
indicate that the explanation of the **dharma** (qualities) is possible. There
is no fault in this.  **End of the Adhikāra Gāthā**  **Hindi Summary of Gāthā
27**  This **gāthā** (verse) explains the six substances in detail, as mentioned
earlier.  **Verse 1**  * **Parināma jīva muttam sapadesam eva khetta kiriyā
ya.** * **Niṭṭam kāraṇa kattā savva-gadi-daram hi yapadeso.**  **Meaning:**  The
**jīva** (soul) and **pudgala** (matter) are the two substances that possess
both **svabhāva** (inherent nature) and **vibhāva** (modifications). The
remaining four substances do not possess **vibhāva** (modifications) and are
therefore primarily **aparināmi** (unchanging). This means that the four
substances do not change their form and remain stable in their form. This is the
first **parināma** (change) authority regarding the six substances. Among the
six substances, the **jīva** (soul) is conscious.  **Note:** This **gāthā**
(verse) is also found in the **Mūlāchāra** chapter 7, **gāthā** 44, and the
**Vasunandi Śrāvakāchāra** **gāthā** 23. **Śrī Jayasen Ācharya** has quoted this
**gāthā** in his commentary to explain the six substances in detail.

The **Panchaastikaya** (five categories) are:  **1.  Jiva (Soul):**   *
**Shuddha Nischhaya Naya** (Pure Deterministic View):  Jiva is pure
consciousness, living through **Shuddha Chaitanya Pranas** (pure conscious life
force). *   **Vyavahar Naya** (Practical View): Jiva lives through the four
**Pranas** (life forces) arising from the **Karma** (actions) - **Indriyadi**
(sense organs and their objects), **Dravya** (substance), and **Bhavarupa**
(mental states). *   Jiva is conscious, while the other five **Dravyas**
(substances) - **Pudgala** (matter), **Dharma** (merit), **Adharma** (demerit),
**Aakash** (space), and **Kaal** (time) - are unconscious and non-living. *
Jiva is the second **Adhikar** (right) among the six **Dravyas**.  **2.  Mooर्ति
(Form):** *   **Mooर्ति** is the form, distinct from the **Amooर्tik**
(formless) pure soul, possessing **Sparsha** (touch), **Rasa** (taste),
**Gandha** (smell), and **Varna** (color). *   **Mooर्ति** is called **Mooर्ति**
or **Puhal** (matter). *   **Jiva Dravya** (soul substance) is **Mooर्tik**
(formful) in **Vyavahar Naya** (practical view) but **Amooर्tik** (formless) in
**Shuddha Nischhaya Naya** (pure deterministic view). *   **Dharma**,
**Adharma**, **Aakash**, and **Kaal** are all **Amooर्tik**. *   **Puhal** is
**Mooर्tik** in **Nischhaya** (deterministic view). *   The other five are
**Amooर्tik**. *   **Mooर्ति** is the third **Adhikar** among the six
**Dravyas**.  **3.  Pradesh (Region):** *   **Jiva Dravya** has countless
regions, as does **Dharma** and **Adharma**. *   **Aakash** has infinite
regions, while **Puhal** has a countable, countless, and infinite number of
regions. *   These five **Dravyas** are **Sapradeshi** (having regions) or
**Bahupradeshi** (having many regions). *   **Kaal** is **Aapradeshi**
(regionless) because it does not have the power to be **Bahupradeshi** and has
only one region. *   **Pradesh** is the fourth **Adhikar** among the six
**Dravyas**.  **4.  Ekaneka (One and Many):** *   **Dharma**, **Adharma**, and

many **Dravyas**. *   **Ekaneka** is the fifth **Adhikar** among the six
**Dravyas**.  **5.  Kshetra (Space):** *   **Aakash** is the only **Kshetramay**

##  Six Substances - Description of Five Astikayas  Therefore, these are called
causes, while the Jiva substance, although it works together like a teacher and
student, does not benefit the five substances like Pudgala, etc. in any way.
Therefore, they are without cause - this is the ninth cause-related authority in
the six substances.  With the pure Dravyarthic Nay, which perceives the pure
parinaamic param bhaav, although the Jiva is not the doer of bondage,
liberation, substance or bhaav, punya, paap, or the creation of ghat-ghat, etc.,
yet with the impure Nishchay Nay, it is the doer of the bondage of punya and
paap, and the enjoyer of their fruits, as it undergoes parinaaman from the
auspicious and inauspicious uses. When this Jiva undergoes parinaaman from the
pure use of Samyak Shraddha, Samyak Gyaan, and Samyak Charitra of the pure Atma
Dravya, then it is also the doer of liberation and the enjoyer of its fruits. It
is worth knowing that the doership of parinaaman in auspicious, inauspicious,
and pure bhaavs is everywhere. The five substances like Pudgala undergo
parinaaman in their own nature, this is the doership in them. In reality, they
are not the doers of punya, paap, etc., but are non-doers. This is the tenth
doership authority in the six substances.  There is one Akash substance spread
throughout the Lok and Alok, therefore it is called Sarvagat. Dharma and Adharma
are Sarvagat in comparison to their pervasiveness in the Lokakash. The Jiva
substance is not Sarvagat except for the state of Lok-purn, in comparison to one
Jiva, i.e., it has a body, size, and shape except for the Samudghat. In
comparison to many Jivas, the entire Lokakash is full of Jivas. The Pudgala
substance is Sarvagat in comparison to the Maha-skandha of Lok-pramaan. The rest
of the Pudgalas are not Sarvagat. Pudgala is also Sarvagat because the entire
Lok is filled with Pudgala. The Kaal substance is not Sarvagat in comparison to
each Kaalanu substance, but it is Sarvagat in the Lok in comparison to countless
Kaanus of the size of the regions of the Lok. This is the eleventh Sarvagat
authority in the six substances.  Although all substances are pervading in one
area with the Vyavhaar Nay, and are entering into each other, yet they do not
leave their own conscious or unconscious nature with the Nishchay Nay. This is
the twelfth authority called Anyony Pravesh in the six substances.  Here, among
the six substances, the one who is the bearer of the qualities of Vitarag,
Chidanandamay, etc., who is the pure Atma Dravya itself, in which there is no
activity of mind, speech, and body, is the one who is worthy of being perceived.
This is the meaning.

The text discusses the nine characteristics of a soul (jiva) as described in the
five astikayas (bodies) mentioned in the previous verses. It explains these
characteristics in detail through 33 verses, each verse representing a specific
aspect of the soul.  The text begins by outlining the nine characteristics of a
soul:  1. **Prabhuta** (Sovereignty): The soul is sovereign and independent. 2.
**Jivatva** (Soul-ness): The soul is the essence of being. 3. **Dehamatrata**
(Body-limited): The soul is limited by the body. 4. **Amurta** (Formless): The
soul is formless. 5. **Chaitanya** (Consciousness): The soul is conscious. 6.
**Upayogi** (Utilitarian): The soul is capable of using its faculties. 7.
**Kartṛta** (Doer): The soul is the doer of actions. 8. **Bhoktṛta**
(Experiencer): The soul experiences the consequences of its actions. 9.
**Karmayuktatva** (Bound by Karma): The soul is bound by karma.  The text then
explains how these characteristics are explained in the 33 verses, highlighting
the different perspectives of various schools of thought:  * **Bhatta** (Jain)
perspective: The first two verses focus on the sovereignty of the soul, leading
to the ultimate goal of omniscience. * **Charvaka** (Materialist) perspective:
The next three verses discuss the soul's existence and its connection to the
body. * **Nyaya** (Logic) and **Mimamsa** (Ritualistic) perspectives: The
following two verses explain the soul's connection to its physical body. *
**Sankhya** (Dualistic) perspective: The next three verses discuss the soul's
formless nature. * **Charvaka** (Materialist) perspective: The next two verses
refute the materialist view and emphasize the soul's consciousness. * **Nyaya**
(Logic) perspective: The next 19 verses discuss the soul's utilitarian nature,
focusing on the two types of utilization: knowledge and perception.  The text
concludes by mentioning the eight types of knowledge, starting with the verse
"Aabhinī..."

##  Translation:  **102** **Six Substances - Description of Five Astikayas**
The sutra "**Ityadi**" is one. Then, for the explanation of the five types of
knowledge, beginning with "**Matinaan**", there are five sutras. Then, for the
sequence of three types of ignorance, there is one sutra, "**Micchatta
Annaan**". In this way, there are seven sutras for the use of knowledge.
Further, for the four types of perception, beginning with "**Darshanam Avi**",
there is one sutra. In this way, there are nine verses in five different
locations, taking into account the authority of the knowledge and perception.
Further, up to ten verses, even though there is a difference in the designation,
characteristics, purpose, etc., of the living being and knowledge in terms of
practice, the non-dualistic nature of knowledge and the living being is
established for the Naiyayikas from the perspective of the regions and
existence, just like fire and heat. Here, the difference between "**Ji**" and
"**Ka**" is mentioned from the perspective of designation and purpose.
"**Jiva**" is the designation for the living being, which is a substance, and
"**Gyan**" is the designation for the knowledge, which is a quality. The living
being is alive through the four breaths, and the one who lives, will live, or
has lived is a living being. This is the characteristic of the living being
substance. The characteristic of the knowledge quality is that it is the means
by which objects are known. The purpose of the living being substance is to not
be destroyed while undergoing transformations in the cycles of bondage and
liberation. The purpose of the knowledge quality is only to know objects. In
this way, it is important to know the different designations, characteristics,
and purposes of the living being and knowledge in brief.  **i**  In the middle
of these ten verses, there are three sutras, "**Na Viapyad**", etc., to
establish the non-dualistic nature of the living being and knowledge in brief.
Then, there are three verses, "**Vavadesa**", etc., supporting the idea that
even though there is non-duality between substance and qualities, there is a
difference in terms of name, etc. Then, the qualities and substances residing in
one region, which are mutually inseparable, i.e., never separated, i.e., whose
non-duality is established, and which are mutually inseparable, non-eradicable,
and supporting each other, have a difference in regions in the different living
beings, etc., which are in the form of qualities and substances, but there is no
difference in regions between the soul and knowledge. The soul is knowledge,
just like the fiber is the plant. This relationship, that this is in that, is
called the **Samavaya** relationship. In the Naiyayika view, this **Samavaya**
is denied. To explain this, there are two sutras, "**Na Hi So Samavayahin**",
etc. Then, there are two sutras, "**Vannaras**", etc., to explain the example
and counter-example in relation to the non-duality between the quality and the
qualified in some respect. The characteristic of the example is stated:
"**Dristau Antau Dharmon Swabhaav Agni Dhumyo: Iva Sadhya Sadhakayo: Vadi
Prativadibyam Kartribhutabhyam Avivaadein Yatra Vastuni Sa Dristanta:**" i.e.,
the example is that object in which the nature of the object and the proof is
seen without any contradiction or dispute by the proponent and opponent, just
like smoke in fire. Briefly, just as there is a characteristic of the example,
there is also a characteristic of the counter-example. In this way, there are
five locations in the previous nine verses and ten locations here in these ten
verses.

The five-fold body (Panchaastikaya) has been established through four such
communities, by means of nineteen sutras, through nine different locations,
resulting in the fall of the community (Samudaya Patanika).  Thereafter, the
pure soul body (Jeevaastikaya) undergoes a transformation into the state of
eternal bliss (Param Anandamaya) and the form of nectar (Amritaroop),
characterized by perfect harmony (Param Samarsi Bhaav).  The soul (Jeeva) that
is distinct from the pure soul body (Jeevaastikaya) and possesses the nature of
being the doer of actions (Kartapana), the experiencer of actions (Bhoktapana),
and the one connected to actions (Sanyogapana), is explained as being either
real (Sat) or unreal (Asat) through eighteen verses, in a sequential manner
(Anupoorvi).  Within these eighteen verses, the first location (Sthal) comprises
three verses, starting with "Jeeva Anaiinihana," which explain the community
(Samudaya) statement.  The second location (Sthal) consists of one verse,
starting with "Udayen," which explains the five states (Bhaav) of arising
(Audayik) and so on.  The third location (Sthal) comprises six verses, starting
with "Kamman Vedaymano," which primarily explain the nature of being the doer
(Kartapana).  The fourth location (Sthal) contains one verse, starting with
"Kamman Kamman Kuchdi," which presents the opposing viewpoint (Poorvapksha).
The fifth location (Sthal) comprises seven verses that address the opposing
viewpoint (Poorvapksha).  Within these seven verses, the first three verses,
starting with "Ogad Gadh," definitively state that the soul (Jeeva) is not the
doer of karmic actions (Dravyakarma).  Then, despite the soul (Jeeva) not being
the doer of karmic actions (Dravyakarma), one verse, starting with "Jeeva
Poggalakaya," states that the soul (Jeeva) is the experiencer of the fruits of
karma (Bhoktapana).  Another verse, starting with "Tamha Kamman Kattha," states
the restriction of the doer-experiencer (Kartapana-Bhoktapana).  The next two
verses, starting with "Evam Kattha," sequentially explain the soul's (Jeeva)
connection to karma (Karma Sanyuktapana) and liberation from karma (Karma
Muktapana).  Thus, there are seven verses in response to the opposing viewpoint
(Poorvapksha).  In this way, through eighteen verses, five locations, and a
sequential approach, the opposing viewpoint (Ekantammat) is refuted, the
principle of non-absolutism (Anekantamat) is established, the disciple is
addressed in accordance with the Samkhya philosophy, the disciple who follows
the Buddhist philosophy is explained, the doubt of the disciple who believes in
the dependence on Sadashiva (Sadashiva Ashrit Matidhari Shishya) is dispelled,
and the connection to karma (Karma Sanyuktapana) is explained.  Thus, the three
rights (Adhikar) of being the doer (Kartapana), the experiencer (Bhoktapana),
and the one connected to karma (Karma Sanyuktapana) should be understood.
Following the explanation of the nine rights (Adhikar) related to the soul body
(Jeevaastikaya), three verses, starting with "Ekko Jem Mahappa," constitute the
soul body (Jeevaastikaya) chapter (Chulika).  In this way, the first great right
(Maha Adhikar), which establishes the five-fold body (Panchaastikaya) and the
six substances (Dravy), has resulted in the fall of the community (Samudaya
Patanika) through three verses, nineteen verses, and six internal rights (Antar
Adhikar) in the fourth internal right (Antar Adhikar).  **Uttanika:**  Further,
the pure soul (Atma) that remains in the state of the world (Sansar Avस्था) is
explained as being pure and without any limiting conditions (Upaadhirahita
Shuddhabhav), while the impure soul (Atma) is explained as being impure and
having limiting conditions (Upaadhi Sahit Bhaavkarma Ragadi Bhaav), and the
unreal (Asadbhoot) conventional reality (Vyavharnay) is explained as being the
karmic action (Dravyakarma) that arises from the limiting condition (Upaadhi) of
karmic action (Bhaavkarma), as far as possible.

## 104 **Description of the Five Astikayas of the Soul**  **General Meaning with
Anvaya (Logical Order):**  (Jivo) This soul is a living being, (Cheda)
conscious, (Uvogavisesido) possessing use, (Pahu) a master, (Karta) a doer, (Ya
Bhota) and an enjoyer. (Dehamatto) It has a body of a certain size, (Nahimutto)
it is not material in essence, and (Kammasamjutto) it is associated with karma.
It possesses these nine qualities.  **Specific Meaning:**  This soul lives
through pure consciousness, knowledge, and other pure life-forces, according to
pure perception. It also lives through impure consciousness, such as the life-
forces of karma and its fruits, according to impure perception. Similarly, it
lives through the life-forces of matter, according to the non-conventional, non-
real, and practical perception. It has lived, is living, and will live,
therefore it is a living being.  This soul is conscious due to pure knowledge
and consciousness according to pure perception, and due to karma and its fruits,
according to impure perception. It possesses use due to pure use, such as
perfect vision and perfect knowledge, according to pure perception, and due to
impure use, such as perception, knowledge, and other life-forces of karma,
according to impure perception. It is a master due to the ability to transform
into pure results, such as liberation and its causes, according to pure
perception, and due to the ability to transform into impure results, such as the
causes of the cycle of birth and death, according to impure perception. It is a
doer due to pure emotions, according to pure perception, due to emotions and
karma, such as attachment, aversion, etc., according to impure perception, and
due to actions of matter, such as knowledge-obscuring karma, etc., and external
actions, such as the body, according to non-conventional, non-real, and
practical perception. It is an enjoyer due to pure happiness, born from the pure
soul, free from attachment, according to pure perception, due to happiness and
sorrow, born from the senses, according to impure perception, and due to the
enjoyment of external objects, such as food and drink, which are the causes of
happiness and sorrow, according to non-conventional, non-real, and practical
perception.  It is the size of the universe, according to pure perception, and
countless times the size of the universe, according to practical perception.
However, it is the size of the body, according to practical perception, due to
the arising of the name-karma called "body." It is not material in essence,
according to pure perception, and it is free from karma. However, it is material
and associated with karma, according to non-conventional, non-real, and
practical perception, due to the association with karma from the beginning of
time.  This is the explanation of the words and their meanings according to
different perceptions. Now, we will explain the meaning according to different
viewpoints. Here, the explanation of the soul is given from the perspective of a
student of the Charvaka philosophy.  **Meaning of the Quoted Verse:**  These
nine examples are for those who do not believe in the soul and rebirth.  (1)
**Vatsa (Child):** A child starts sucking its mother's breast immediately after
birth. This is impossible without past impressions. Therefore, the soul and its
past birth are proven.  ...  ...  ...

(2) The being with the letters, starting from the five-lettered being,
pronounces the letters knowingly for its own purpose. If the being is considered
to be made of the five elements, then it cannot pronounce the letters knowingly
and with knowledge. Just as a machine made of inert matter cannot pronounce
words knowingly, so too the soul is different from the elements. (3) Existence
(birth) - the holding of the body - as long as a permanent soul is not
considered, the holding of the body - birth will not be possible. (4) Analogy -
what is seen in one living being is also seen in others. All beings have four
cognitions within them: food, fear, sex, and attachment. The functioning of the
senses is the same. All this cannot happen without a different soul. If only the
physical body is considered, then the analogy will be meaningless. Why is this
similarity without a specific reason? (5-6) Heaven and Hell - Heaven and Hell
are famous in the world. If the soul is not considered, then who will go to
heaven as a result of virtue and who will go to hell as a result of sin? (7)
Ancestors - If the soul is not considered, then the famous saying that ghosts
and spirits come and say that they were your father, etc., will be destroyed, or
the worship of ancestors, shraddha, etc., in the world will not be possible if
the soul is destroyed. (8) Stove - If the soul is made of the five elements,
then the pot placed on the stove is made of the five elements: earth, water,
fire, air, and space. Why is there no knowledge or desire in it? (1) Dead - The
dead body is also made of earth, water, fire, air, and space. Why is there no
desire or knowledge in it? In this way, it is proved by nine examples that the
soul is eternal and different from inert matter. Or, the explanation of the
common quality of consciousness should be known in a general way for all
opinions. This being is not different from the use of knowledge and the use of
vision. This explanation has been given to explain to the disciple following the
Nyaya school of thought, because the Nyaya school of thought sometimes accepts
the quality and the difference of the quality. This soul is the Lord because it
is the preacher of liberation and the means of liberation. This explanation has
been given because the words of the liberated omniscient are authoritative.

##  Translation:  **106**  **Explanation of the Six Substances and Five
Astikayas**  This explanation, relying on the Bhatta Cakramataka, is intended to
help disciples understand the concept of omniscience. It uses nine examples, as
stated in the following couplet, because the Bhatta-Carvaka philosophy does not
accept the existence of an omniscient being.  The meaning of the quoted verse is
explained here to establish the truth. Just as the brightness of a gem-lamp
appears to increase and decrease, we can infer that there must be something with
greater brilliance. Similarly, since we see knowledge increasing and decreasing
in the beings of the world, it is possible for a being to possess complete
knowledge. The one who possesses complete knowledge is the omniscient. This is
the meaning of the other examples as well: (2) the increasing and decreasing
brightness of the sun's rays, (3) the moonlight, (4) the light of the stars, (5)
the light of metals and stones, (6) the shine of gold, (7) the shine of silver,
(8) the brilliance of crystal, (9) the intensity of fire. The example of gold
and silver is relevant because they are found to be pure even when they are
impure. Similarly, an impure soul, while becoming pure, should also be found to
be completely pure. That is the omniscient.  This being is the doer of both pure
and impure actions. This explanation is given to help disciples who follow the
Sankhya philosophy, which holds the view that the being is not the doer. And
this being is the enjoyer. This explanation is given to address disciples who
follow the Buddhist philosophy, which believes that the doer does not experience
the fruits of his actions because they are transient. This being remains as the
witness of its own body. This statement is made to dispel the doubts of
disciples who follow the Nyaya, Mimamsa, and Kapila philosophies, because they
believe that the soul is omnipresent or atomic. This being is formless. This
explanation is given to address disciples who follow the Bhatta-Carvaka
philosophy, because they do not consider the being to be different from pure,
inert matter, which is beyond the senses. This being is combined with material
karma and mental karma. This explanation is given to refute the Sadashiva
philosophy, because they believe that the soul is always liberated and pure. In
this way, it is important to understand the meaning through different
philosophies.  The explanation of the meaning through the Agamas is that this
being is the possessor of the nature of being, consciousness, etc. This is well-
known in the Param-Agama. The meaning here is that one should strive to
contemplate the pure being-astikaya, which is free from all limitations and
possesses only the qualities of omniscience, etc., by abandoning all the false
perceptions and the results of the limitations like attachment, etc., which are
born from karma.  In this way, it is important to understand the meaning of
words, the meaning of the Nayas, the meaning of philosophies, the meaning of the
Agamas, and the meaning of the essence, as much as possible, at all times.

##  The Five Astikayas and the Liberation of the Soul  **107**  Here, the
disciple asks why, after explaining the community of the five Astikayas in the
context of the views of Charvaka and others, the text now states that the
liberation of the soul is the foundation for understanding the nature of the
soul. The Acharya responds by explaining that the previous discussion was meant
to establish the authority of the teachings, emphasizing the importance of the
nine authorities, such as the authority of the liberated soul. This is because
the teachings are only valid if they come from a source that is truly liberated
and omniscient. As the saying goes, "The authority of the speaker determines the
authority of the words."  Here, the text emphasizes that the nature of the soul
can only be understood if the soul itself exists. This is a fundamental
principle of the scriptures. Therefore, before discussing the specific qualities
of the soul, such as consciousness, it is necessary to establish the existence
of the soul itself. This is why the text first refutes other viewpoints and then
presents the nine authorities as a foundation for understanding the soul. There
is no contradiction in this approach.  Thus, the discussion of the authorities
is complete.  **Time for Explanation - Verse 28**  Here, the text describes the
liberated soul's true nature, free from all limitations. The soul, freed from
the shackles of karma and defilement, transcends the cycle of rebirth and
attains the end of the world. It then becomes all-knowing and experiences
infinite bliss, free from the limitations of the senses.  **Verse 28**  The
soul, freed from karma and defilement, transcends the cycle of rebirth and
attains the end of the world. It then becomes all-knowing and experiences
infinite bliss, free from the limitations of the senses.  The soul, being
inherently pure, is liberated from the influence of karma at a specific moment.
This liberation leads to the soul's natural tendency to ascend beyond the cycle
of rebirth. Having reached the end of the world, the soul remains in a state of
eternal bliss, free from the need for further movement. This is because the
soul, in its true nature, is pure consciousness and omniscience. It experiences
infinite bliss, transcending the limitations of the senses.  The liberated soul
continues to exist as a living being, characterized by the principles of life
force and sustenance. It possesses the quality of consciousness, the ability to
perceive, and the capacity to utilize its consciousness. It also possesses the
power of authority, the ability to act, the experience of bliss, the awareness
of its past and future bodies, and the ultimate state of formlessness, free from
all limitations.  The liberated soul is no longer bound by karma, as it has been
freed from both material and mental karma. Material karma is associated with the
physical body, while mental karma is associated with the fluctuations of
consciousness. The fluctuations of consciousness are caused by the interaction
of the soul with the karmic veil, which obscures its true nature. When the
karmic veil is removed, the soul's true nature, pure consciousness, shines
forth.

The description of the six substances and the five astikayas, which pervades the
entire universe in all its regions simultaneously, attains a certain state of
stability and does not undergo transformation. This is indeed the definite
attainment of omniscience and omnipresence, which is the cessation of the agency
of the karmas that are bound to the substances and the karmas. This is also the
cessation of the experience of the fruits of happiness and sorrow, which are
conditional due to the absence of experience prior to transformation. This is
also the experience of the self, which is infinite consciousness, free from the
pain of endless transformation, and established in its own nature, as the
experience of its own independent nature. || 28 ||  Hindi Time Explanation
Verse-28 Anvayaarth - (Karmamalvipra Mukta:) The soul freed from the karma-mal
(Karma-dust) (Urdhva) above (Lokasya Antam) the end of the world (Adhigamy)
having attained (Sa: Sarvajnanadarshi) he, the omniscient-omnipresent (Anantam)
infinite (Anindriyam) non-sensory (Sukham) happiness (Labhate) experiences.
Commentary - Here the nature of the liberated soul is described without any
conditions. The soul (Karma Rajake) due to the nature of the other substances,
when it is completely freed from the karma-dust at that moment (Apne) due to its
upward-moving nature, it attains the end of the world and due to the absence of
any further movement (Vahan) it becomes stable there, only knowledge and only
vision (Nij) being its nature, it does not leave them and experiences infinite,
non-sensory happiness. That liberated soul, the essence of which is the
characteristic (nature) of the living being, the characteristic of which is the
nature of the knower, the characteristic of which is the nature of the 'use' of
the transformation of consciousness, the power of all the acquired (spiritual)
rights is the form of dominance, the extraordinary nature of all things is the
form of the creation of its own nature (Nij Swaroopko Rachaneroop) is the
agency, the characteristic of which is the nature of self-independence is the
form of the attainment of happiness is the experience, the past, the future
(final) body according to the immersion transformation is the form of the body
measure, and the conditional relationship is the ultimate (completely) separate
from the abstract nature. (The liberated soul) is never associated with karma,
because it is completely free from substance-karma and karma-karma. Substance-
karma is the nature of the pudgala and karma-karma is the transformation of
consciousness. The power of consciousness, due to the contact (relationship)
with the karma of ignorance, etc., is limited in its operation, and therefore it
operates in each and every region of the knowable universe, one after the other,
and undergoes transformation. But when the contact of the karma of ignorance,
etc., is destroyed, then it operates simultaneously in all the regions of the
knowable universe, and becomes stable in a certain way, and does not attain any
other object, and does not undergo transformation. This (the absence of
transformation of the power of consciousness), is indeed the definite (fixed,
immovable) attainment of omniscience and omnipresence, which is the destruction
of the agency of the karmas that are bound to the substances and the karmas.
This is also the cessation of the experience of the fruits of happiness and
sorrow, which are conditional due to the absence of experience prior to
transformation.

##  Verse 28:  **109** The destruction of the five astikayas, and the enjoyment
of the infinite bliss of the soul, which has attained its eternal state of
being, free from the sorrow of the endless cycle of birth and death, is the
experience of its true nature.  **Commentary:**  This verse, through the
qualities of being a means to liberation and being supreme, shows the nature of
the liberated soul, which is characterized by perfect knowledge, etc., in order
to establish the attainment of omniscience.  **General Meaning:**  The liberated
soul, freed from the defilement of karma, becomes omniscient and all-seeing. It
ascends and reaches the end of the universe, where it experiences infinite, non-
sensory bliss.  **Specific Meaning:**  This soul, completely free from the three
types of karma - karma of the substance, karma of the mind, and karma of the
body - becomes omniscient and all-seeing through perfect knowledge and perfect
vision. Due to its nature of upward movement, it ascends and reaches the end of
the universe, where it remains, as there are no further astikayas. What does it
do there? It experiences the natural, infinite, non-sensory bliss of the
liberated soul.  **Interpretation:**  This verse implies that, out of the nine
principles mentioned in the previous verse, the eight principles of pure soul,
pure consciousness, pure use, etc., should be understood as applicable to the
liberated state as well, as long as they do not contradict the scriptures.

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  **Verse 29 of the Time
Commentary**  He is self-aware, omniscient, all-knowing, and sees all beings. He
attains infinite, unobstructed, and formless bliss. ||29||  **Commentary:**
This verse supports the idea of the Siddha's (liberated soul) unconditioned
knowledge, perception, and bliss. The soul's inherent nature is knowledge,
perception, and bliss. In the state of samsara (cycle of birth and death), due
to the contraction of the soul's power by the karmic impurities, it experiences
limited knowledge, perception, and happiness through the senses. It experiences
happiness that is dependent on external objects, bound by form, obstructed, and
finite.   However, when all karmic impurities are destroyed, the soul's power
becomes free and uncontracted. It then spontaneously and simultaneously knows
and perceives everything (all substances, fields, time, and states). It
experiences bliss that is independent, formless, unobstructed, and infinite.
Therefore, the Siddha, who knows and perceives everything and experiences his
own bliss, has no need for anything external. ||29||

## Pancastikaya Prabhruta Sanskrit Tatparyavritti - 29  **Now, what was said
earlier, the meaning of the term "Jada Samiti" from the Nirupaadhi Shaan
Darshan, is further supported by the statement: "Jada himself, if he is all-
pervading, all-world-seeing, - the soul, by certainty, is of the nature of pure
knowledge, pure vision, and pure bliss, - even though he is in the state of
Samsara, covered by karma, he knows something or the other, by the knowledge
that diminishes the obscurations caused by the interruption of the process of
karma, he sees something or the other, by such vision, he experiences something
or the other, the worldly bliss, which is dependent on the senses, and is full
of obstacles, - the same soul, the knower, by certainty, becomes all-knowing by
the power of time and attainment, and becomes all-seeing."**  **How does he,
thus become, act? He attains, obtains, the sense-less, obstacle-less, self-
contained, supreme bliss. What? Bliss, is the explanation. What kind of bliss?
Sense-less. Again, how is it? Obstacle-less. Again, what is special about it?
Its own self-nature. Again, what kind? It is formless, due to being independent
of the gross senses.**  **Here, by the statement "he himself becomes", the
earlier mentioned Nirupaadhitva (non-dependence) is supported. And, by the
statement "he himself becomes all-knowing, all-seeing, by certainty", the
earlier mentioned Sarvajnatva (all-knowingness) and Sarvadarshitva (all-
seeingness) are supported.**  **Now, a follower of the Bhattacharvaka philosophy
says: "There is no all-knowing, due to non-perception, like the horn of a
hare."**  **To this, the reply is given: "Where is there no all-knowing? In this
country, and in this time? Or, in the three worlds, and in the three times? If
it is said that there is no all-knowing in this country, and in this time, then
it is acceptable. But, if it is said that there is no all-knowing in the three
worlds, and in the three times, then how do you know? If you know that the three
worlds, and the three times, are devoid of an all-knowing, then you yourself are
all-knowing. Why? Because, whoever knows the three worlds, and the three times,
is the all-knowing. If, on the other hand, you do not know the three worlds, and
the three times, devoid of an all-knowing, then how do you deny that there is no
all-knowing in the three worlds, and in the three times?"**  **Now, the opinion
is: "What is the example here? Just as someone, seeing a ground devoid of a pot,
with his eyes, later says, "There is no pot on this ground", it is right.
Another, who is blind, says, "There is no pot on this ground", but it is not so.
Similarly, whoever knows the three worlds, and the three times, devoid of an
all-knowing, by direct perception, is capable of denying the all-knowing, and
not another, like a blind man. But, whoever knows the three worlds, and the
three times, does not deny the all-knowing in any way. Why? Because, by having
the knowledge of the three worlds, and the three times, he himself is all-
knowing. And, the statement "due to non-perception", is not right. Why? Because,
is the non-perception yours, or of the people who exist in the three worlds, and
the three times? If the non-perception is yours, then there is no absence of the
all-knowing. Why? Because, if you do not know the subtle things like atoms, and
the thoughts of others, then do they not exist? Or, if the perception of the
all-knowing is of the people who exist in the three worlds, and the three times,
then how do you know it? This earlier thought remains. This is the refutation of
the reason. And, the statement "like the horn of a hare", is also not right.
Why? Because, the horn of a hare does not exist everywhere, it is seen directly
in a cow, etc. Similarly, the all-knowing does not exist in the desired country,
and time, and not everywhere. This is the refutation of the reason, and the
refutation of the example, in short.**

## 112 **Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas**  **Now, the
argument:** You have stated that the absence of omniscience is a fault. What is
the proof for the existence of omniscience?   **The proof is stated here:**
Omniscience exists, as explained earlier, because there is no proof to
contradict it, just like the experience of happiness, sorrow, etc., which are
self-evident.   **Or, a second proof is stated through inference:** The object
of inference is that any particular person, whose nature is subtle, distant, in
the past, in the future, or different, is perceived.   **Why?** Because it is
the subject of inference. Whatever is the subject of inference is perceived by
someone, just like fire, etc. These are the subjects of inference, therefore
they are perceived by someone.   **Whatever is not perceived by someone is not
the subject of inference, just like flowers in the sky, etc. These are not the
subjects of inference, therefore they are not perceived by someone.**
**Therefore, they are perceived by someone.**  **In short, this is the proof for
the existence of omniscience. A detailed explanation of the refutation of the
arguments against omniscience, which are not valid, contradictory, and not
conclusive, is given elsewhere in the detailed explanation of omniscience. Here,
it is not mentioned because this is a spiritual text.**  **The meaning is that
this very form of the omniscient, free from attachment, is to be contemplated as
constantly attainable by the abandonment of all attachments, etc.**  **Thus,
these two verses explain the concept of omnipotence as the main point.**
**Hindi Commentary on Verse 29:**  **The first verse states that the knowledge
and vision of the liberated soul is free from all limitations. This verse
further supports this by stating "Jado hi sayam" (He is himself).**  **Meaning
with Anvaya:** (If that) soul (sayam) itself (savinh) is omniscient (y) and
(savvalokadarsi) sees all the worlds (jado) being (anatam) without limitations,
(avyabadham) without obstacles, (sagam) arising from its own self, and (amutt)
formless (suh) happiness (pappodi) attains or experiences.  **Special Meaning:**
This soul, even though it possesses the nature of pure knowledge, pure vision,
and supreme happiness, is covered by karma in the state of the world. It
gradually knows through the knowledge of the cessation of the senses, which is
the knowledge of the senses. It sees through the vision of the eyes and the
vision of the mind. It experiences the limited, dependent, and formless
happiness that arises from the senses. When the soul, which is conscious,
becomes itself omniscient and all-seeing due to the attainment of time, etc., it
experiences the formless happiness that is free from the limitations of the
senses and is dependent on the self. Here, the statement that this soul becomes
itself omniscient and all-seeing supports the fact that it is already free from
limitations and is omniscient and all-seeing.  **Here, someone who follows the
Charvaka philosophy might say that there is no omniscience because no one is
seen. Just like the horns of a donkey are not seen?**

The **Pancastikaya** refutes the doubt that there is no omniscient being,
stating that if you say that there is no omniscient being in this time, then
there is no omniscient being in the three realms and three times. If you say
that there is no omniscient being in this assembly or in this place, then we
accept it. But how do you know that there is no omniscient being in the three
realms and three times? If you have known the omniscient being without knowing
the three realms and three times, then you yourself are omniscient, because the
omniscient being is one who knows all three realms. If you are not omniscient
and you do not know the three realms and three times, then how can you deny that
there is no omniscient being in the three realms and three times?  An analogy is
given: Just as someone who has not seen a pot on the earth with their own eyes
says that there is no pot on this earth, their statement is correct. But can a
blind person say that there is no pot here without seeing it? No, they cannot.
Similarly, only someone who has seen the three realms and three times and
directly knows that there is no omniscient being can deny the existence of an
omniscient being. Another person who does not know everything cannot deny it
like a blind person. But someone who knows the three realms and three times
cannot deny the omniscient being in any way, because they themselves become
omniscient - they have knowledge of the three realms and three times.  You have
argued that there is no attainment of omniscience, but that is not correct. The
question is whether you have not attained omniscience or whether the people in
the three realms and three times have not attained omniscience. If you have not
attained omniscience, then it does not mean that there is no omniscience,
because you do not even know about subtle substances like atoms, or the thoughts
of others. It cannot be assumed that because you do not know, these things do
not exist. If you say that the people in the three realms and three times have
not attained omniscience, then how did you know this? We have already considered
this. This flaw is in your argument. And the analogy you gave, "like the horns
of a donkey," is also not correct, because donkeys do not have horns, but it
does not mean that there are no horns anywhere. Horns are clearly seen in cows
and other animals. Similarly, the omniscient being is not here in this country,
but it does not mean that it does not exist anywhere. In this way, it should be
understood that there are flaws in your argument and analogy.  Then the doubter
says that you have pointed out the flaws in the absence of an omniscient being,
but tell us what evidence is there for the existence of an omniscient being?
Here is the evidence: There is an omniscient being, because as stated earlier,
there is no evidence to contradict it, just as there is no evidence to
contradict the existence of pleasure and pain that we experience. Or, another
inferential evidence is that subtle substances, objects that are obstructed or
covered by others, objects that are far away, and objects that are in the past
or future, are all known by the omniscient being.

## 114  The six substances and five astikayas are described as objects, their
nature is imperceptible. These objects are directly perceived by any particular
person. This is the established doctrine. The supporting reason for it is that
this park is inferred, whatever object is the subject of inference, it is
certainly perceived by someone, like fire, etc. Because all these objects are
the subject of inference, therefore they are certainly perceived by someone.
Whatever is not perceived by anyone is also not the subject of inference. Like a
flower in the sky, it is not perceived by anyone. In this way, one should know
the proof of the existence of omniscience in brief. In detail, the refutation or
support of omniscience is explained in other texts with the help of invalid,
contradictory, multi-faceted, and insignificant reasons. One should know it from
there. This is a spiritual text, nothing special is said in it. The meaning is
that this is the nature of the liberated omniscient, who, by abandoning all
attachments and other obstacles, is constantly capable of grasping and
contemplating. || 29 ||  ## Time Explanation Verse 30  With four breaths, he
lives, he will live, who indeed lived before. That being is breaths, again
strength, senses, lifespan, and breath. || 30 ||  **Explanation of the quality
of being alive:**  Breaths are characterized by senses, strength, lifespan, and
breath. Among them, those that are connected to the universal consciousness are
called "भावप्राण" (bhaava-praana), and those that are connected to the universal
matter are called "द्रव्यप्राण" (dravya-praana). Because both of these breaths
are sustained without interruption in all three times, the being is a "संसारि"
(samsari) or a being in the cycle of birth and death. However, the liberated
being only sustains "भावप्राण" (bhaava-praana), which is why it is considered
liberated. || 30 ||  ## Hindi Time Explanation Verse 30  **Anvayaartha:** (Yah
khalu) who (chaturbhih praanaih) with four breaths (jeevatti) lives.
(jeevishati) will live and (jeevitah purvam) lived in the past, (sah jeev) that
is the being. (punah praanah) and those breaths (indriyam) senses, (balam)
strength, (aayuh) lifespan and (umchchvaasah) breath.  **Tika:** This is the
explanation of the quality of being alive.  Breaths are in the form of senses,
strength, lifespan, and breath. Among them (in breaths), those that are
connected to the universal consciousness are called "भावप्राण" (bhaava-praana),
and those that are connected to the universal matter are called "द्रव्यप्राण"
(dravya-praana). Because both of these breaths are sustained without
interruption in all three times (with unwavering flow), the being is a "संसारि"
(samsari) or a being in the cycle of birth and death.

**Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas**  Infinite are the
*aguru* and *laghu* (qualities, parts) with which all beings are constituted.
They are infinite in number and spread throughout countless realms. Some beings
are not present in all realms, being bound by false views and passions. Many
beings are liberated from these, becoming *siddhas* (liberated souls).
**Explanation**  This passage describes the natural characteristics of beings
and their division into liberated and unliberated. Beings are essentially
indivisible and constitute a single substance, occupying a single, undivided
realm. Their *aguru* and *laghu* qualities are indivisible, characterized by
their inherent nature, which is the basis of their existence. These qualities
are infinite in number, constantly changing and increasing or decreasing in the
six realms of existence. The realms themselves are composed of countless,
indivisible atoms, which are extremely subtle.  Some beings, due to their
specific state of existence, are present in all realms, while others are not.
Those who are bound by false views and passions, which have been present since
time immemorial, are *samsarin* (bound to the cycle of rebirth). Those who are
liberated from these are *siddhas*, and both types of beings are infinite in
number.

##  Translation:  **Verse 31-32**  This section discusses the characteristics of
souls, including their lightness and heaviness, their countless locations, their
pervasiveness and non-pervasiveness, and their liberation and bondage.
**Explanation:**  * **Agurulaghu** (lightness and heaviness) qualities are
infinite, each with countless divisions and subdivisions, arising from the six
categories of existence (**shat-sthana**). * All souls are characterized by
these infinite **agurulaghu** qualities. * Souls are located in countless
regions, as vast as the space of the universe. * Some souls are pervasive,
filling the entire universe, either in terms of their physical presence or their
subtle influence. This is supported by the saying, "The universe is continuous,
both gross and subtle." * However, some souls are not pervasive, either because
they are not physically present in the universe or because their senses are weak
or impaired. * Souls are further distinguished by their **mithyadarshan** (false
belief), **kashaya** (passions), and **yoga** (attachment). Those who are free
from these are **siddhas** (liberated souls), while those who are bound by them
are **samsarin** (bound souls). * The ultimate goal is to shed all **vikalpa**
(false perceptions) and **raga** (attachment), becoming like a **siddha** and
experiencing the bliss of one's own pure soul.  **Overall Meaning:**  This
section emphasizes the infinite nature of souls, their diverse locations, and
their potential for liberation. It also highlights the importance of shedding
false beliefs and passions to achieve liberation.

## 118 ## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  The six
substances are eternal. Some of these living beings, i.e., some Kevalis, spread
throughout the universe at the time of the Kevali's liberation, or, in other
words, the subtle, stationary, one-sensed living beings are omnipresent in the
universe - they are present everywhere. In this regard, some living beings are
omnipresent, while others, who are not in the state of filling the universe, or
the one-sensed, the confused, and the five-sensed living beings, are not
omnipresent, i.e., they are present in some places and not in others - they are
not present in all parts of the universe. Among all these living beings, those
who are devoid of attachment, etc., and who are in the state of pure Jiva-
astikaya, which is characterized by eternal bliss and one nature, are bound by
false perception, passions, and karmas, as much as possible, and are infinite in
number. These are the worldly beings. And those who are free from false
perception, passions, and karmas are infinite in number. These are the Siddhas.
Here, the meaning is that, with the hope of liberation, abandoning all kinds of
attachments, etc., like the Siddhas, this soul of mine, which is adorned with
the taste of eternal bliss, is the pure Jiva-astikaya, and is worthy of being
spoken about. 131-32.  In this way, the three verses on the main point of Jiva-
siddhi, for the instruction of the disciple, according to the Charvaka
philosophy, have been completed with the above-mentioned nine examples, starting
with "Vachchakkharam".  ## Time Explanation Verse - 33  "Just as a ruby is
thrown into milk and illuminates the milk, so too, the soul, residing in the
body, illuminates only its own body." 33.  This is an explanation of the example
of the body being the only thing that is illuminated. Just as a ruby, when
thrown into milk, illuminates the milk with its own light, which is distinct
from the milk, so too, the soul, residing in the body, which is rooted in the
eternal passions and impurities, illuminates the body with its own parts. Just
as the ruby's light intensifies when the milk is heated by fire, and diminishes
when the milk cools down, so too, the soul's parts expand when the body is
nourished by special food, etc., and contract when the body is deprived of
nourishment. Just as the ruby, when thrown into a large quantity of milk,
illuminates the entire quantity of milk with its light, so too, the soul,
residing in a large body, illuminates the entire body with its parts. Just as
the ruby, when thrown into a small quantity of milk, illuminates only the small
quantity of milk with its light, so too, the soul, residing in a small body,
illuminates only the small body with its parts. 33.

**The Five Astikayas: Natural**  **119 Hindi Time Explanation Verse 33**
**Anvayaartha (As it is)**  Just as (padmaragaratan) a padmaragaratan (khire
kshiptam) when placed in milk (kheeram prabhaasayati) illuminates the milk,
(tatha) in the same way (dehi) the dehi (jeev) (dehasthah) residing in the body
(swadehamaatram prabhaasayati) illuminates only the extent of its own body.
**Commentary:**  This is a statement about the example of the extent of the
body.  Just as a padmaragaratan, when placed in milk, pervades that milk with
its inseparable group of light, in the same way, the jeev, due to the stain of
kshaya from beginningless time, remains in the body obtained due to that stain
and is confined to this body by its own regions. And just as, due to many
coincidences, when the milk boils, the group of light of the padmaragaratan also
boils, i.e., it expands, and when the milk settles, the group of light also
settles, in the same way, when the body grows due to specific food, etc., the
regions of the jeev expand, and when the body dries up, the regions also
contract. Again, just as that padmaragaratan, when placed in more milk, pervades
that more milk by the expansion of its group of light, in the same way, the
jeev, when it obtains a place in a larger body, pervades that larger body by the
expansion of its own regions. And just as that padmaragaratan, when placed in
less milk, pervades that less milk by the contraction of its group of light, in
the same way, the jeev, when it obtains a place in a smaller body, pervades that
smaller body by the contraction of its own regions. ||33||  **Sanskrit Tatparya
Vritti Verse 33**  Now, keeping in mind the intention of explaining the subject
of the extent of the body, this sutra is presented. Even though this is a
distraction, it is appropriate to consider this sutra in mind, or to consider
this sutra as the next sutra, and to decide that this sutra is appropriate, and
to present this sutra. This is the characteristic of a jnanika, which should be
known everywhere as much as possible. Just like a padmaragaratan. Just as a
padmaragaratan, the agent, which is made of what? It is placed, thrown, where?
In milk, in milk, in milk. What does it do in milk? It illuminates, it
illuminates the milk, clearly. So, the dehi, the samsari, residing in the body,
illuminates only its own body. For example, here, by the word padmaraga, the
light of the padmaragaratan is understood, not the gem itself. Just as the group
of light of the padmaragaratan, when placed in milk, pervades that milk, so too,
the jeev, while residing in its own body, pervades that body in the present
time. Or, just as, due to the coincidence of a specific fire, when the milk
increases, the group of light of the padmaragaratan also increases, and when it
decreases, it also decreases, so too, due to specific food, when the body
increases, the regions of the jeev expand, and when it decreases, they contract.
Or, just as that group of light, when placed in more milk, pervades that more
milk, and when placed in less milk, pervades that less milk, so too, the jeev,
pervading all the substances, qualities, and synonyms of time, which are present
in the three worlds and three times, with the light of knowledge and vision,
which is capable of pure knowledge and vision, ...

##  Verse 3 of the Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  **The
meaning is as follows:**  The pure soul, possessing the miraculous power of
consciousness, due to its unique transformations in false beliefs, attachment,
aversion, and other modifications, acquires the karma called "body-karma." This
body-karma, due to its expansion and contraction caused by its arising, spreads
throughout the body of a great fish, measuring thousands of yojanas, when it
attains the highest level of pervasiveness.  When it attains the lowest level of
pervasiveness, it spreads throughout the body of a tiny nigoda, measuring an
infinitesimal fraction of an utsedha-ghana-angula.  And when it attains the
middle level of pervasiveness, it spreads throughout bodies of medium size.

**Verse 34 of the Samaya Vyākhyā Gāthā**  **Pancāstikāya Prābhṛt**  Here, the
existence of the soul in different bodies, its distinctness from the body, and
the cause of its transmigration are explained.  **The Soul Exists Everywhere,
But Is Not One with Any Single Body**  The soul exists everywhere, but it is not
one with any single body. It is distinct from the body, like milk in water. The
soul is stained by the impurities of karma, and it wanders from body to body
because of its karmic actions.  **Explanation**  The soul, in its state of
samsara, exists in a continuous stream of bodies. It exists in one body, and
then in another, and so on. This is why it is said that the soul exists
everywhere. However, the soul is not one with any single body, because it is
distinct from the body. The soul is distinct from the body because it is not
bound by the body. The soul is bound by karma, and it is this karma that causes
it to transmigrate from body to body.  **Commentary**  This verse explains the
soul's existence in different bodies, its distinctness from the body, and the
cause of its transmigration. The soul exists in a continuous stream of bodies,
but it is not one with any single body. The soul is distinct from the body
because it is not bound by the body. The soul is bound by karma, and it is this
karma that causes it to transmigrate from body to body.

##  Verse 34: Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas in Sanskrit
**This verse explains the existence of the same soul in past, present, and
future bodies, its distinctness from the body, and the cause of its
transmigration.**  **It says:**  The soul (Jiva) exists everywhere, in all past,
present, and future bodies. It is the same soul, not a new one arising as the
Charvakas believe. It is not one with the body, nor is it made of the body.
Although it appears to be one due to its association with the body, it is not
truly one. Why? Because it is like milk and water, one in essence but distinct.
Or, the soul exists throughout the body, not in one particular place. Or, from
the perspective of subtle senses, there is a multitude of souls in the world.
Although they appear to be one due to their similar qualities like omniscience,
they are actually distinct, like a heap of gold adorned with different colored
clothes and sixteen different colors.  **The cause of transmigration is
explained:**  The soul, burdened by the end-results of passions (Aadhyavasana),
is stained by the dust of karma and wanders in the cycle of birth and death.
Although its true nature is pure and characterized by omniscience and
liberation, it is bound by the karmic chains of past actions and is enveloped by
the impurities of karma, which are the cause of its attachment to passions. It
strives to take birth in a new body, driven by these impurities.  **The verse
implies:**  The soul, which is the infinite, pure, and omniscient self, is the
one that should be sought after in all situations, especially when facing good
and bad thoughts and actions.  **This verse refutes the views of the Mimansakas,
Naiyayikas, Sankhyas, and their followers.**  **It emphasizes the importance of
understanding the true nature of the soul through the experience of one's own
body.**  **The verse also highlights the seven stages of liberation (Samuddhara)
mentioned in the previous verse.**

The soul, though it interacts with the body like milk and water, remains
distinct from it. It pervades the entire body, not just a part. This means that
even though all souls are equal in their inherent qualities of knowledge,
perception, etc., they are distinct due to their different karmic accumulations
and locations in the universe. Just as gold beads of the same purity are
distinct when strung on threads of different colors, so too are souls distinct
despite their shared essence.   Though the soul is inherently pure and possesses
only knowledge and perception, it is bound by karmic forces, which manifest as
passions, aversions, and other karmic tendencies. These tendencies lead to the
accumulation of karmic matter, which obscures the soul's true nature and compels
it to take birth in different bodies.   The soul, being distinct from the body
and possessing infinite knowledge and other qualities, is worthy of
contemplation, especially when one renounces all desires and aversions.   To
address the doubts of those who follow the Mimamsa, Nyaya, and Sankhya schools
of thought, the verse "Vegraṇakasa ya vegubdhiya ya māraṇantiya samugghādo, tejo
hāro chaṭo sattamao kevalīṇam tu" (which states that the soul, except for the
seven types of aggregates - pain, passions, destructive karmic tendencies,
energy, food, and the state of liberation - is shaped by its body) is explained
in detail in two verses.  **Verse 35:**  The nature of the soul is not present
in the liberated ones, nor is it completely absent. This is because the soul's
nature is characterized by the presence of life force and the absence of karmic
tendencies. The liberated ones do not have a body, and they transcend the realm
of speech and thought.

124 Description of the six substances and five astikayas, along with the
explanation of their unity like water and milk, because they are completely
different bodies even after attaining the state of being beyond the reach of
words due to the separation of the kṣayās, which are the cause of their
connection, and the attainment of the state of being beyond the reach of words,
because they are constantly shining with their inherent nature, which is free
from all limitations, attained without the support of worldly life-breath and
without the connection of the body. || 35 || Hindi time explanation verse-35
Anvayaarth-( Yeṣām ) whose ( Jīvasvabhāvaḥ ) jīvasvabhāva ( -prāṇadhāraṇarūpa
jīvatva ) ( na asti ) is not and ( sarvathā ) completely ( tasya abhāvaḥ ca )
its absence also is not, ( te ) they ( bhinnadehāḥ ) bodiless ( vāggocaram
atītā; ) beyond the reach of words ( siddhāḥ bhavanti ) siddhas ( siddha )
Bhagavants are. Commentary This is the arrangement of the jīvatva and the body-
measure of the siddhas. The siddhas do not have the jīvasvabhāva as their main
form due to the nature of holding the dravya-prāṇa, but they do not have the
complete absence of the jīvasvabhāva either, because the main form of the
jīvasvabhāva is the existence of the bhāva-prāṇa. And they do not have the same
existence as water and milk with the body, because the kṣayās, which are the
cause of the connection with the body, and the yoga have been separated,
therefore they are completely bodiless even after becoming transformed into the
state of being beyond the reach of words and the state of being beyond the reach
of the body. And their glory is beyond the reach of words, because they
constantly shine (they are shining) with their inherent nature, which is free
from all limitations, attained without the support of worldly life-breath and
without the connection of the body. || 35 || Sanskrit Tātparvavṛtti Verse-35

## Pancastikaya Prabhrit Hindi Tatparyavritti Gatha - 35  **Translation:**  It
is further stated that pure soulhood belongs to the Siddhas. They are pervading
the space only as much as their body-size before or after becoming Siddhas,
therefore they are slightly less than their final body-size in terms of
practical experience or past logic.  **Meaning with Anvaya:**  [Jesin] Just as
[Jivashao] the impure nature of the worldly soul [Natthi] does not remain [Y]
but (Tass) the absence of that soul nature [Savvaha] is also not completely
absent [Te] they [Bhinnadeha] are separate from all bodies [Vachigoyaramdida]
such Siddhas (Hont) are beyond the reach of words.  **Special Meaning:**  The
body-bearing soul, which is born from the rise of karma, has the elements of
senses and other substances and the essence of life, these essences of life are
absent in the Siddhas. Here the disciple doubts that if the elements and the
essence of life are not there, then will the soul completely cease to exist as
in Buddhism? In response to this doubt, it is said that the true nature of the
soul is not destroyed, the pure existence, the pure essence of life in the form
of consciousness, knowledge, etc., always remains. Those Siddhas, unlike the
pure soul without a body, are devoid of the mind-speech-body yoga and the
passions like anger, etc., which are the causes of the birth of the body,
therefore they are without a body, they are Siddhas. Even though those Siddhas
are devoid of the elements and the essence of life of the world, they remain
radiant in their nature. Therefore, their glory or nature cannot be described by
our words of limited knowledge. They are the possessors of the eight qualities
like right faith, etc., and the infinite qualities included in them, therefore
their description is also not possible. Here the meaning is that just as the
Saugata, i.e., the Buddhist, seeing the momentary nature of substances,
considers its pervasiveness and accepts the momentary nature of substances even
in the form of elements, similarly, seeing the absence of the impure soulhood of
the ten essences of life, etc., in the state of liberation, he accepts the
absence of the pure soul with infinite qualities like pure knowledge, etc., as
well. 35.  **Samaya Vyakhya Gatha - 36**  **Translation:**  This is the negation
of the cause-and-effect relationship of the Siddha.  **Meaning:**  But from
where is it born, because the action is not done by it, so it is not a Siddha.
It does not produce anything, because the cause is not there, so it is not a
Siddha. 36.

## 126 ## Six Substances - Description of the Five Astikayas  **Since the Siddha
is not produced from any cause, he is not a product. Since he does not produce
anything, he is not a cause either.** || 36 ||  Just as the samsari jiva is born
in the form of a deva, man, animal, or hell being, due to the causal chain of
his own karma-formed atma-parinama and the causal chain of karma-formed pudgala-
parinama, so too is the Siddha born in the same way - this is not the case. The
Siddha, with the destruction of both karmas, is born of himself, not from any
other cause. Just as the samsari jiva, being a cause, produces the effects of
his own karma-formed atma-parinama and karma-formed pudgala-parinama, and thus
produces the effects of deva, man, animal, and hell being, so too does the
Siddha produce his own form - this is not the case. The Siddha, with the
destruction of both karmas, produces only himself, not anything else.  **Hindi
Explanation of the Verse - 36**  **Anvaya-artha:** (Yasmat sa Siddha) The Siddha
(kutashchit api) is not born from (anya) any other (karan) cause. (Tena)
Therefore, (karyam na) he is not a (kary) product, and (kinchit api) he does not
produce (anya karyako) any other (utpadayati) product. (Tena) Therefore, (sa) he
(karanam api) is not a (na bhavati) cause either.  **Tika:** This negates the
existence of a cause-and-effect relationship for the Siddha.  Just as the
samsari jiva is born in the form of a deva, man, animal, or hell being, due to
the causal chain of his own karma-formed atma-parinama and the causal chain of
karma-formed pudgala-parinama, so too is the Siddha born in the same way - this
is not the case. The Siddha (Siddha Bhagavan) is actually born of himself, with
the destruction of both karmas, and is not born from any other cause (karma-
formed atma or karma-formed pudgala).  Furthermore, just as the samsari jiva,
being a cause, produces the effects of his own karma-formed atma-parinama and
karma-formed pudgala-parinama, and thus produces the effects of deva, man,
animal, and hell being, so too does the Siddha produce his own form - this is
not the case. The Siddha is actually born of himself, with the destruction of
both karmas, and does not produce anything else (karma-formed atma-pudgala or
the effects of deva, etc.). || 36 ||  **Sanskrit Tatparya-vritti of the Verse -
36**  Now, the verse establishes the absence of a cause-and-effect relationship
for the Siddha, in comparison to karma. The samsari jiva, who is born from a
cause, is not born at any time in the form of a man, hell being, etc. Because -
(Yasmat karanat) from what cause, (kajjam na tena so Siddha) the Siddha is not a
product due to that cause, (utpadedi na kinnivi) he does not produce anything,
(svayam karma-na-karma-rupam kim api na utpadayati) he does not produce anything
in the form of karma or non-karma, (karanam iha tena na so hodita) therefore, he
is not a cause.

## Pancastikaya Prabhrit 127  **Verse 36:**  "Even with respect to karma and
non-karma, there is no cause or effect." This gatha sutra implies that one who
is firmly convinced that there is no cause or effect with respect to karma and
non-karma, is the one who possesses infinite knowledge and other qualities. Such
a being is directly worthy of being attained when the mind, speech, and body
cease their activities, which are the cause of the arising of karma and the
acceptance of new karma.  **Hindi Commentary:**  Verse 36 of the Uththānika
section further shows that the liberated soul is not the effect of karma or non-
karma, nor is it the cause of them.  **General Meaning with Anvaya:**  (Jamha)
Because (kudochi vi) from no one (uppannno na) has been born (tena) therefore
(so siddho) that liberated soul (kajjana) is not an effect. And (kinchi vi) to
no one (na upppadedi) does it give birth (tena) therefore (sa) this liberated
soul (karanam avi) is also not a cause.  **Specific Meaning:**  Just as worldly
beings are born in various forms like humans, hell beings, etc., due to the
arising of karma, the liberated soul is not born from the arising of karma or
non-karma. Therefore, they are not the effect of anything, nor do they
themselves give rise to any karmic bondage or produce a body made of non-karma.
Therefore, the liberated soul is not a cause with respect to karma and non-
karma. In this gatha sutra, whoever is firmly convinced that there is no cause
or effect with respect to karma and non-karma, is the one who possesses infinite
knowledge and other qualities. Such a being is directly worthy of being attained
when the mind, speech, and body cease their activities, which are the cause of
the arising of karma and the acceptance of new karma.  **Commentary on Time:**
**Verse 37:**  Here, the idea that the absence of a soul is liberation is
refuted.  **Satsad:**  "Eternal, annihilation, future, non-future, void, and
other things. Knowledge and ignorance are not applicable to a non-existent
nature."  **Explanation:**  "Substance is eternal in its own nature. In an
eternal substance, there is annihilation of transformations at every moment.
Substance is always destined to become future transformations. Substance is
always destined to not become past transformations. Substance is always void of
other substances."

## Verse 128:  **Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas**  A
substance is always non-zero with respect to its own substance. Sometimes, in a
living being, there is infinite knowledge, and sometimes there is finite
knowledge. Sometimes, in a living being, there is infinite ignorance, and
sometimes there is finite ignorance. This, being otherwise impossible, reveals
the existence of the soul in liberation. ||37||

##  Refutation of the Buddhist View of Liberation as the Absence of a Jiva
**Verse 37 of the Hindi Commentary on the Uththanika**  This verse refutes the
Buddhist view that liberation is the absence of a jiva (soul).  **General
Meaning with Anvaya (Word Order):**  (Sassa-dam) Eternal existence (ay) and
(ucchedam) destruction (bhavya-m) being worthy of liberation (cha) and
(abhavya-m) being unworthy of liberation, (sunna-m) emptiness (cha) and (idaram)
non-emptiness (vipanan-am) knowledge (avinna-nam) and non-knowledge (sambhave
asadi) the existence of the liberated jiva is not present (na vi jujjhadi)
cannot be.  **Specific Meaning:**  The existence of the liberated soul (Siddh
Bhagwan) is eternal. This is why the following eight characteristics are
inherent in them:  1. **Eternal Existence (Shaashvatapana):**  They are
eternally existent in their single nature of being the knower and seer, as
revealed by their Tanko-tkirna (perfect) knowledge. They are not destroyed. 2.
**Destruction (Ucched or Vyayapana):**  Due to the nature of Paryayas (states of
existence), there is always destruction of Paryayas in relation to the six
states (Shat-Sthan) and the increase and decrease of the subtle and gross
qualities. This destruction is inseparable from creation. This creation and
destruction is the nature of every Paryaya of every substance. 3. **Worthy of
Liberation (Bhavya-pana):**  They are eternally evolving in their single nature
of being pure knowledge and bliss (Chidananda-maya), free from all impurities.
This is their inherent nature of being worthy of liberation. 4. **Unworthy of
Liberation (Abhavya-pana):**  They will never evolve into the states of past
falsehood, attachment, and other impure states (Vibhava-parinama) in their
liberated state. This absence of these states is their inherent nature of being
unworthy of liberation. 5. **Emptiness (Sunya-pana):**  They are devoid of the
fourfold external reality (Paradravya, Parakshetra, Parakal, Parabhava) which
are distinct from their pure nature. This absence of the external reality is
their inherent emptiness. 6. **Non-Emptiness (Ashunya-pana):**  They possess the
fourfold internal reality (Nijadravya, Nijakshetra, Nijakal, Nijabhava) which is
related to their supreme self. They are never devoid of their pure qualities. 7.
**Knowledge (Vijnana):**  They are complete and pure in their perfect knowledge
(Kevalgyan) which illuminates all substances, qualities, and states of existence
at once. 8. **Non-Knowledge (Avinnana):**  They are devoid of the impure
knowledge (Vibhava-rupa) such as limited knowledge (Mati-gyana), destruction
(Kshaya), and delusion (Upshama).  Therefore, these eight characteristics
(eternal existence, destruction, worthy of liberation, unworthy of liberation,
emptiness, non-emptiness, knowledge, and non-knowledge) cannot be established if
the existence of the jiva is not accepted in liberation. They are established
only when the jiva exists. The existence of these characteristics proves the
existence of the pure jiva in liberation. This verse implies that only the pure
jiva is worthy of being attained.

##  Verse 130: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  Thus, in
accordance with the views of Bhatta Charvaka, three verses have been completed,
stating the immateriality of the soul to destroy the arguments of his disciples.
|| 37 ||  **Verse 38: Explanation of the Quality of Consciousness**  The fruit
of karma is one, the action is one, and knowledge is one. The living being is
conscious in three ways. || 38 ||  **Explanation:**  This verse explains the
quality of consciousness.  Some conscious beings, i.e., souls, are extremely
polluted by delusion and whose power is sealed by a very strong veil of
ignorance, are primarily conscious of the fruit of karma, which is in the form
of pleasure and pain. This is because their ability to act (to become
transformed into the form of karma-consciousness) has been destroyed by a very
strong obstacle to their energy.  Other conscious beings, i.e., souls, who are
extremely polluted by delusion and whose power is sealed by a strong veil of
ignorance, are primarily conscious of action, even though it is accompanied by
the experience of the fruit of karma in the form of pleasure and pain. This is
because their ability to act (to become transformed into the form of karma-
consciousness) has been weakened by a moderate obstacle to their energy.  Still
others, whose entire delusion has been washed away, whose veil of ignorance has
been completely removed, and whose entire power has been completely unsealed,
are conscious only of knowledge, because they have completely exhausted the
fruit of karma and have become completely free from action. They experience
natural, inherent happiness. || 38 ||  **Hindi Explanation of Verse 38:**
**Anvaya:** [Trividhena chetakbhaavena] By three types of consciousness, [ekah
jeevarashih] one living being, [karmaanām phalam] is the fruit of karma, [ekah
tu] one living being, [kāryam] is action, [karmachetanaako] (ath) and [ekah] one
living being, [jñānam] is knowledge, [chetayati] is conscious (knows).
**Commentary:**  This is the explanation of the quality of consciousness.  Some
conscious beings, i.e., souls, are extremely polluted by delusion and whose
power (strength) is sealed by a very strong veil of ignorance, are primarily
conscious of the fruit of karma, which is in the form of pleasure and pain. This
is because their ability to act (to become transformed into the form of karma-
consciousness) has been destroyed by a very strong obstacle to their energy.
Other conscious beings, i.e., souls, who are extremely polluted by delusion and
whose power is sealed by a strong veil of ignorance, are primarily conscious of
action, even though it is accompanied by the experience of the fruit of karma in
the form of pleasure and pain. This is because their ability to act (to become
transformed into the form of karma-consciousness) has been weakened by a
moderate obstacle to their energy.

**Verse 38**  Those who have attained the ability to perform the work of
destroying and pacifying the minor obstacles to their efforts, primarily
experience the "work" [karma-consciousness] mixed with experience.   The other
experiencer, i.e., the soul, who has attained infinite energy due to the
destruction of all obstacles to effort, experiences the natural happiness-like
knowledge, which is inseparable from itself, through the nature of the
experiencer, due to the destruction of all obscuring karmic stains, the
destruction of all knowledge-obscuring karmic stains, the full development of
all powers, the elimination of the fruits of karma, and the attainment of
complete fulfillment. ||38||

## Description of the Six-Sense and Five-Sense Beings  **Verse 39:** This verse
explains what each being experiences. All beings, indeed, experience the fruits
of their karma. The stationary beings experience the fruits of their karma, the
mobile beings experience the fruits of their karma along with their actions, and
the liberated souls experience knowledge.  **Commentary:** Here, it is explained
what each being experiences (i.e., what kind of consciousness they have).
"Experiences," "perceives," "achieves," and "knows" all have the same meaning,
as consciousness, perception, achievement, and knowledge all have the same
meaning. There, the stationary beings experience the fruits of their karma, the
mobile beings experience the fruits of their karma along with their actions, and
the liberated souls experience knowledge.  **Meaning:** The five types of
stationary beings experience the fruits of their karma in the form of subtle
happiness and suffering. The mobile beings with two senses and above experience
the same fruits of their karma along with their actions, which are in the form
of desires and aversions. The liberated souls, who have perfect knowledge,
experience only knowledge (along with infinite bliss).  **Sanskrit Commentary:**
Here, it is explained what each being experiences. What is the meaning of
"explains"? In response to this question, the word "all" should be understood in
the context of this question-and-answer format. All beings, indeed, experience
the fruits of their karma. These are the five types of stationary beings. The
stationary beings experience the fruits of their karma in the form of subtle
happiness and suffering. The mobile beings with two senses and above experience
the same fruits of their karma along with their actions, which are in the form
of desires and aversions. The liberated souls, who have perfect knowledge,
experience only knowledge (along with infinite bliss).

**Verse 39**  The five-sense beings and above, up to the 133rd category,
experience the fruits of their karma, which are both the action and its result.
Those who are devoid of life senses also experience the fruits of their karma.
However, the liberated souls, having transcended the ten types of life,
experience only pure knowledge due to their unwavering state of bliss and
oneness with the supreme bliss. This is the meaning of the two verses.  **Verse
40**  The use of knowledge is twofold: knowledge and perception. The soul always
experiences this use of knowledge, which is the transformation of consciousness.
This use of knowledge is also twofold: the use of knowledge and the use of
perception.

The use of the five senses, such as the use of the hand to pick up an object, is
called "Panchaastikaya Praabhrut Upayog". The use that involves choice is called
"Gyaanopyog", and the use that is without choice is called "Darshanopyog". The
living being exists with both these uses. This use is always inseparable from
the living being, it is one, although it is different in terms of name,
characteristics, purpose, etc. ||4||  This is how the two types of use, Gyaan
and Darshan, are explained. A verse is spoken to inform about this.  Time
Explanation Verse-41: This is the name and form of the special Gyaanopyog.
(Aabhinibodhik, Shruta, Avadhi, Manahparyaya, Kevala) These are the five types
of Gyaan.  (Kumati, Shruta, Vibhang) These three are also connected with Gyaan.
||14||  (Aabhinibodhik, Shruta, Avadhi, Manahparyaya, Kevala) These are the five
types of Gyaan.  (Kumati, Shruta, Vibhang) These three are also connected with
Gyaan. ||41||  There are names for these: Aabhinibodhik Gyaan, Shruta Gyaan,
Avadhi Gyaan, Manahparyaya Gyaan, Kevala Gyaan, Kumati Gyaan, Kushruta Gyaan,
Vibhang Gyaan. The soul is the pure Gyaan that pervades all the regions of the
soul. This soul, being covered by the karma of ignorance, when it perceives the
gross and subtle substances with its senses, due to the destruction of the
covering, the calming of the senses, and the dependence on the senses, it is
called Aabhinibodhik Gyaan. When it perceives the gross and subtle substances
with its senses, due to the destruction of the covering, the calming of the
senses, and the dependence on the senses, it is called Shruta Gyaan. When it
perceives the gross substances with its senses, due to the destruction of the
covering and the calming of the senses, it is called Avadhi Gyaan. When it
perceives the gross substances in the mind of another, due to the destruction of
the covering and the calming of the senses, it is called Manahparyaya Gyaan.
When it perceives all the gross and subtle substances completely, due to the
complete destruction of all the coverings, it is called Kevala Gyaan.
Aabhinibodhik Gyaan, which is accompanied by the rise of false views, is called
Kumati Gyaan. Shruta Gyaan, which is accompanied by the rise of false views, is
called Kushruta Gyaan. Avadhi Gyaan, which is accompanied by the rise of false
views, is called Vibhang Gyaan. This is the name and form of these. Thus, the
eight types of Gyaanopyog, starting with Mati Gyaan, have been explained. ||4||
Hindi Time Explanation Verse-41: Anvayaarth - (Aabhinibodhik, Shruta, Avadhi,
Manahparyaya, Kevala) Aabhinibodhik (Mati), Shruta, Avadhi, Manahparyaya, and
Kevala (Gyaanani Panchabhedani) Thus, there are five types of Gyaan.

##  Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas, Verse 3 (Delusions,
False Knowledge, and Distortions)  **Verse 3:**  Delusion, false knowledge, and
distortion [all three] are also combined with the five types of knowledge [thus
there are eight types of knowledge utilization].  **Commentary:** This explains
the names and nature of the different types of knowledge utilization. There are
(1) Intuitive Knowledge, (2) Scriptural Knowledge, (3) Clairvoyance, (4)
Telepathic Knowledge, (5) Omniscience, (6) Delusion, (7) False Knowledge, and
(8) Distorted Knowledge - these are the names of the different types of
knowledge utilization.  **Now, their nature is explained:** The soul is truly
infinite, pervading all soul-regions, and is pure knowledge by nature. Being
veiled by the karma of knowledge-obscuration, it experiences (1) Intuitive
Knowledge, which is the perception of concrete and abstract substances in a
distorted way, due to the weakening of the veil of knowledge and the dependence
on the senses and mind; (2) Scriptural Knowledge, which is the perception of
concrete and abstract substances in a distorted way, due to the weakening of the
veil of knowledge and the dependence on the mind; (3) Clairvoyance, which is the
perception of concrete substances in a distorted way, due to the weakening of
the veil of knowledge; (4) Telepathic Knowledge, which is the perception of
concrete substances related to other minds in a distorted way, due to the
weakening of the veil of knowledge; (5) Omniscience, which is the natural
perception of concrete and abstract substances in their entirety, due to the
complete destruction of all veils. (6) Delusion is Intuitive Knowledge arising
with the rise of false belief; (7) False Knowledge is Scriptural Knowledge
arising with the rise of false belief; (8) Distorted Knowledge is Clairvoyance
arising with the rise of false belief. Thus, the nature of the different types
of knowledge utilization is explained. In this way, the eight types of knowledge
utilization, starting with Intuitive Knowledge, have been explained.  **Verse
41:**  Now, the names of the different types of knowledge utilization are
explained: Intuitive Knowledge, Scriptural Knowledge, Clairvoyance, Telepathic
Knowledge, and Omniscience are the five types of knowledge. Delusion, False
Knowledge, and Distorted Clairvoyance are the three types of false knowledge.
The meaning here is: Just as the sun, veiled by clouds, appears to be divided
into many parts, so too, the soul, which is truly one and undivided in its
nature, appears to be divided into many parts due to the veil of karma, as it
experiences different types of knowledge, starting with Intuitive Knowledge.
**Verse 41:** This verse explains the names of the eight types of knowledge
utilization.

137 The five types of knowledge, starting with *panchaastikaya*, along with
their meanings and explanations (including *aabhini sadho thi manakevalaani*):
*mati*, *shruta*, *avadhi*, *manahparyaya*, and *kevala* (these five are called
*panchabheyaani*). These five are the different forms (called *naanaani*) of
right knowledge. There are eight types of knowledge in total, which are combined
(called *sanjutte*) with three types of ignorance (called
*kumadhisudavibhangani*): *kumati*, *kushrut*, and *vibhanga* [these three are
called *tinni vi naanehi*].  **Specific Meaning:** Just as the sun is one, but
its light appears different due to the covering of clouds, similarly, the soul
is also whole and one in its true nature, but it appears to be different due to
the coverings of karma. Therefore, there are many types of knowledge, such as
*sumati* knowledge, etc.  **End of the verse explaining the eight types of
knowledge.** The next six verses do not have any commentary available, so they
are presented separately from 1 to 6.  **Verse 1 of the Sanskrit Commentary:**
Now, the five types of knowledge, starting with *mati*, are explained in five
verses. As follows:  *mati* knowledge is threefold: *uvaladdhi*, *bhavana*, and
*uavogo*. It is also fourfold, with *darshanapuvva* being the first.  **Verse 1
of the Hindi Commentary:** The next five verses explain the nature of the five
types of knowledge, starting with *mati*. These verses are not found in the
commentary by Amrit Chandra.  *mati* knowledge is threefold: *uvaladdhi*,
*uavogo*, and *bhavana*.

## 138 ## Six Substances - Description of the Five Astikayas (**Cha Bhavanam**)
And contemplation, the thought of what is known. (**Tahu Ev**) Similarly, it
(**Chaduviyappam**) is of four types. (**Darshanpukh**) With the knowledge of
perception (**Ganam**) this knowledge (**Havdi**) happens.  **Special Meaning:**
This soul, according to the principle of certainty, is an undivided, pure,
knowledge-filled entity. According to the principle of practical application, it
is covered by karmas in the state of the world. When the karma of the knowledge-
obscuring covering is destroyed or subdued, the knowledge that arises through
the five senses and the mind, which knows both concrete and abstract objects
with or without alternatives or distinctions, is called **mati-jnana**. It is of
three types: the power to know objects that is obtained through the destruction
or subduing of the knowledge-obscuring covering karma is called **upalabdhi
mati-jnana**. "This is blue, this is yellow," etc., the activity of knowing an
object in this way is called **upayoga mati-jnana**. Repeatedly thinking about
the known object is **bhavana mati-jnana**. This **mati-jnana** is of four
types, based on the distinctions of **avagraha**, **iha**, **avaya**, and
**dharana**. Alternatively, it is also of four types: **kostha-buddhi**, **bija-
buddhi**, **padanusari buddhi**, and **sambhinna-srotrita buddhi**. This **mati-
jnana** happens with the perception of the form of existence. The implication
here is that the **mati-jnana** that is in front of the pure soul, which is free
from modifications, according to the principle of certainty, is the one that is
worthy of being adopted, as it is the means to infinite happiness. The external
**mati-jnana** that is its means is worthy of being adopted according to the
principle of practical application. || 1 ||  **Verse 2 of the Sanskrit
Commentary:**  **Sudanaan Pun Naani Bhanthi Laddiyaa Bhavanaa Chev.
Uvaoganayaviyappam Naanena Ya Vatthu Atthass ||2||**  **Sudanaan Pun Naani
Bhanthi** - The wise ones say that the soul, as mentioned earlier, when the
karma of the knowledge-obscuring covering is destroyed or subdued, knows
concrete and abstract objects indirectly. This is again called **shruta-jnana**.
**Tacc Kathambhuttam?** - How is it? **Laddi Ya Bhavanaa Chev** - It is in the
form of attainment and contemplation. **Punaravi Kimvishistam?** - What is its
special characteristic? **Uvaoganayaviyappam** - It is the alternative of
application and the alternative of principle. Here, the word **upayoga** refers
to the evidence that grasps the object, and the word **naya** refers to the
alternative of the knower, which grasps a part of the object. Thus, it is said:
**Nayo Jnaturabhipraayah**. **Kena Kritva Vastugrahakam Pramanam
Vastvekadeeshagrahako Naya Iti Chet?** - What is the evidence that grasps the
object, and what is the principle that grasps a part of the object? **Naanena
Ya** - It is said that the evidence is the knower, the distinguisher, the
grasper, and **Vatthu Atthass** - the grasper of all objects. **Arthasya
Vastvekadeeshasya, Kathambhutasy?** - What is the nature of the part of the
object that is grasped by the principle? It is the principle that grasps the
object in the form of its qualities and synonyms. Here, the implication is that
the pure soul, which is of the nature of pure knowledge and perception, is
worthy of being adopted in certainty, as it is the means to the supreme soul,
which is the essence of the three jewels of right faith, right knowledge, and
right conduct. The external means is worthy of being adopted in practical
application. || 2 ||

##  Panchaastikaya Prabhrit Hindi Tatparyavritti Gatha - 2  **Uttanika -**
Further, the Shruta Jnana is said to be...  **139**  **Anvaya Saha Samaanyarth
-** (Pun) Then (Naani) the Knowers (Sudanaanam) call Shruta Jnana (Bhaanti) as
(Vaththu Atyass Naanena Tha) knowing the object and its essence (Ladhi Ya
Bhavanaa Chev Uvoga Nayaviyappam) there are distinctions in that Shruta Jnana
like Labdhi, Bhavana, Upayoga and Nay.  **Vishesharth -** The same soul which
had known the object through Mati Jnana, when the Shruta Jnana Avaraniya Karma
is destroyed and subsided, then the one who knows the concrete and abstract
objects, is called Shruta Jnana by the Knowers. That Shruta Jnana which is in
the form of attainment of power is Labdhi, which is in the form of repeated
contemplation is Bhavana. There are two more distinctions in it, Upayoga and
Nay. By the word Upayoga, one should take the knowledge of the evidence which
takes the object, and by the word Nay, one should take only the intention of the
knower who takes the object in one aspect, because it is said - "Nayoh
Jnaturabhipraayah" that Nay is only the intention of the knower. Knowing the
object in all its forms, which is in the form of Guna Paryaya, is Praman, and
knowing only one Guna or one Paryaya mainly is Nay. Here, the meaning is that
the pure Jnana Darshan, which is the nature of pure Atmik Tattva, which is the
cause of the Paramatma Tattva which is to be taken, is to be taken with
certainty, and in the form of Samyak Shraddha, Jnana and Acharan, which is the
Abhed Ratna Trayaroop Bhava Shruta. And in the practical Nay, one should take
the Dravya Shruta, which is the cause of this Bhava Shruta Jnana. ||2||  ##
Panchaastikaya Prabhrit Sanskrit Tatparyavritti Gatha - 3  **Ohi Taheva Gheppadu
Desam Param Cha Ohisavvam Cha.** **Tinnivi Gunena Niyama Bhavena Desam Taha
Niyadam.** ||3||  **Ohim Tava Gheppadu -** This Avaradhi Jnana, when the
Avaradhi Jnana Avarana Karma is destroyed and subsided, becomes the knowledge of
the concrete object which is known through direct perception, as previously
explained, the Shruta Jnana is of three types - Labdhi, Bhavana and Upayoga,
similarly, you should take and know this Avaradhi, leaving out Bhavana, in three
ways. **Desam Param Cha Ohim Savvam Cha** - Or, the Avaradhi Jnana is of three
types - Desha Avaradhi, Parama Avaradhi and Sarva Avaradhi, but the Parama
Avaradhi and Sarva Avaradhi are for those who are filled with the joy of Chid
Uchchalan, who have tasted the nectar of supreme bliss, who are in the state of
Sama Rasa Bhava, and who have attained the ultimate body of Tapa. And it is said
- "Paramohi Savvahi Charamasarirasas Viradasa" - **Tinnivi Gunena Niyama -** All
three Avaradhis are with certainty due to the special Samyaktavadi Guna.
**Bhavena Desam Taha Niyadam -** The meaning is that the Avaradhi of Devas and
Narakas is the Desha Avaradhi by the rule of Bhava Pratyaya. ||3||

**Uththanika -** Further, the Avadhijnana is described. **Anvaya Saha
Samaanyarth -** (Taheva) In the same way, (Ohi) Avadhijnana (Gheppadu) is
grasped (Desha) Deshavadhi (Cha Param) and Paramavadhi (Ohisavvam) and
Sarvavadhi (Tinnivi) all three (Niyama) by the rules (Gunena) by the qualities
like Samyaktva (Taha) and (Bhavena) by the Bhava (Yidan) by the rule (Desam)
Deshavadhi is attained. **Vishesharth -** The Avadhijnana is that which, upon
the destruction and cessation of the Avadhijnana Avarana Karma, knows the
material objects directly. Just as before, the Shrutajnana was described in
three ways, namely, the attainment, the feeling, and the use, similarly, the
Avadhijnana, leaving aside the feeling, is of the nature of attainment and use.
The power of Avadhijnana is that attainment, the bending of the Chetan towards
that is the use, and its three divisions are also known, namely, Deshavadhi,
Paramavadhi, and Sarvavadhi. But out of these three, the Paramavadhi and
Sarvavadhi knowledge is attained by those liberated souls, the monks, who are on
the path of liberation, who are full of the feeling of Chetan and are immersed
in the state of perfect harmony, the taste of the nectar of supreme bliss. As
the saying goes, "Paramohi Savvohi Charamasharirasya Viradasa." All these three
Avadhijnanas are attained by the rules due to the qualities like Samyagdarshan,
etc. And the Bhava Pratyay Avadhi, that is, the Avadhi which is attained due to
the birth of Devas and Narakas, is by the rule, only Deshavadhi. This is the
meaning. 3. **Sanskrit Tatparyavritti Gatha - 4** **Viulamadi Pun Nana

## Chapter 142: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas, but Only
Knowledge is One  **Verse 5:**  The description of the six substances and five
astikayas is given, but only knowledge is one. The five types of knowledge
(mati, shruta, avadhi, mana, and kevala) are explained in terms of their
differences, but these are for practical purposes. In reality, the soul is the
light of one, undivided knowledge, just like the sun without clouds.
**Commentary:**  This verse concludes the explanation of the five types of
knowledge (mati, shruta, avadhi, mana, and kevala). The commentary emphasizes
that these distinctions are for practical purposes and that in reality, there is
only one, undivided knowledge. The soul is the light of this knowledge, just
like the sun without clouds.  **Verse 6:**  The three types of ignorance are
described:  * **Michchhatta:** Wrong belief, which arises from the false
perception of substances. * **Annan:** Non-knowledge, which is the absence of
knowledge. * **Avirati:** Non-restraint, which is the lack of control over the
senses.  **Commentary:**  This verse describes the three types of ignorance:
wrong belief, non-knowledge, and non-restraint. These are the obstacles to
attaining liberation.  **Explanation:**  * **Michchhatta:** Wrong belief arises
from the false perception of substances. This is the belief that the soul is the
body, or that the world is permanent. * **Annan:** Non-knowledge is the absence
of knowledge. This is the lack of understanding of the true nature of reality. *
**Avirati:** Non-restraint is the lack of control over the senses. This is the
inability to resist the temptations of the world.  These three types of
ignorance are the root cause of suffering. By overcoming them, one can attain
liberation.

##  Translation:  **Pancastikaya Prabhrut**  143. Just as ignorance and non-
restraint exist, so too do good and bad conduct, and valid and invalid
knowledge. When does this happen? During the time of contemplation of the truth.
Why? Because of reliance on perception. What is the object of this? The
knowable, which is the soul and its attributes. Here, the opposite of falsehood,
the faith in the true meaning, is the cause of the certainty of right conduct,
which is the practical right conduct. Its result is the certainty of right
conduct, which is characterized by the experience of the pure, unchanging self.
This is the meaning. || 6 ||  **Hindi Tatparya Vritti Gatha 6**  The next three
types of ignorance are:  **Anvaya Sahit Samanyarth (Michchhatta)**  The
knowledge that arises from the false view of substance (Annanam) is in the form
of ignorance, i.e., wrong understanding, wrong knowledge, and fragmented
knowledge (Aviradibhavo Ya). There is also the absence of vows (Bhavaranana). In
the same way, during the time of contemplation of the truth, relying on the
knowable, which is the soul and its attributes (Neyam Paducc Kale), good conduct
becomes bad conduct, and valid knowledge becomes invalid knowledge (Dunyay
Duppamanam Cha). The meaning here is that the opposite of falsehood, the faith
in the true meaning, which is the practical right conduct, and which is the
cause of the certainty of right conduct, or whose result is the certainty of
right conduct, which is characterized by the experience of the pure, unchanging
self, both are worthy of being adopted. || 6 ||  **Samaya Vyakhya Gatha 42**
This is the naming and description of the specific uses of vision. Vision is
also classified as having eyes, not having eyes, and being accompanied by
clairvoyance. It is also classified as being non-material, infinite in scope,
and being pure knowledge. || 42 ||  **Darsanam Api Chakshur Yutam Api Cha
Avadhina Sahitam**  Vision is also classified as having eyes, not having eyes,
being accompanied by clairvoyance, and being pure knowledge. || 42 ||  The names
are: vision with eyes, vision without eyes, vision with clairvoyance, and pure
vision. The soul is inherently infinite, pervading all parts of the self, and
pure vision. Due to the obscuring of its parts by the karmic veil of ignorance,
which is beginningless, the soul, being obscured by the karmic veil, perceives
the material world in a fragmented way through the sense of sight. This is
vision with eyes. When the karmic veil is removed, and the soul perceives the
material and non-material world in a fragmented way through the other four
senses, excluding sight, this is vision without eyes. When the karmic veil is
removed, and the soul perceives the material world in a fragmented way, this is
vision with clairvoyance.

## Chapter 144: Description of the Six Substances, Five Astikayas, and the Four
Types of Vision  **Verse 42:**  The description of the four types of vision:
**Chakshu Darshan** (vision with eyes), **Achakshu Darshan** (vision without
eyes), **Avadhi Darshan** (clairvoyance), and **Kevala Darshan** (omniscience).
**Commentary:**  This verse describes the names and nature of the different
types of vision.  * **Chakshu Darshan:** Vision through the eyes. * **Achakshu
Darshan:** Vision through other senses and the mind. * **Avadhi Darshan:**
Clairvoyance, the ability to see beyond the limitations of the physical senses.
* **Kevala Darshan:** Omniscience, the complete and perfect knowledge of all
things, past, present, and future.  The soul is inherently infinite and pervades
all realms. However, due to the obscuring effects of karma, it experiences a
limited perception of reality.  * **Chakshu Darshan:** When the obscurations of
**Chakshu Darshan** are diminished, the soul perceives the material world
through the eyes, but only in a limited and imperfect way. * **Achakshu
Darshan:** When the obscurations of **Achakshu Darshan** are diminished, the
soul perceives both the material and non-material world through other senses and
the mind, but still in a limited and imperfect way. * **Avadhi Darshan:** When
the obscurations of **Avadhi Darshan** are diminished, the soul perceives the
material world directly, without the limitations of the physical senses. *
**Kevala Darshan:** When all obscurations are completely eliminated, the soul
attains **Kevala Darshan**, the state of omniscience, and perceives all things
in their entirety, without any limitations.  This is the description of the
different types of vision.

## Pancastikaya Prabhrut 145. The Keval Darshan is said to be. Here, the meaning
is that the pure Jiva Astikaya, which is the basis of infinite qualities
inseparable from Keval Darshan, is the only one capable of possessing them.
||42||  Thus, the explanation of the use of Darshan is mainly contained in the
Gatha.  **Hindi Tatparya Vritti Gatha-42** further explains the names and nature
of the different types of Darshan use.  **Anvaya Sahit Samanyarth** -
[Darshanam] Darshan (avi) also (chakkhujurda) with eyes (avi) and
[achakkhujurdam] without eyes (ya) and [ohinasahyam] with Avadhi (chavi)
similarly (anidharna antarahit [anantavisayam] infinite subject matter (keliyam)
with Keval (pannatam) is said to be.  **Vishesharth** - There are four types of
Darshan use, namely - Chakshu, Achakshu, Avadhi and Keval. Although the soul
inherently possesses an infinite and undivided nature of Darshan, due to the
karmas that bind it, it is covered by the Chakshu Darshan Avarana karma. This
karma is destroyed by the cessation of the Chakshu Darshan Avarana karma, and
the soul, through the external sense organ called Chakshu, sees only the
existence of material objects without any modifications. This is called Chakshu
Darshan. Similarly, when the Avarana karma of the other four senses, the mind,
and the non-sense organs is destroyed, the soul, through the external sense
organs of touch, etc., and the mind, sees the existence of material and
immaterial objects without any modifications. This is called Achakshu Darshan.
When the Avadhi Darshan Avarana karma is destroyed, the soul directly sees the
existence of material objects without any modifications. This is called Avadhi
Darshan. When the Keval Darshan Avarana karma is destroyed due to the power of
the pure soul's experience of the undivided nature of pure consciousness and
bliss, free from the defects of attachment, etc., the soul sees the existence of
all objects in the three worlds and the three times simultaneously. This is
called Keval Darshan, which is the natural ability to perceive the existence of
infinite objects. Here, the meaning is that the pure Jiva Astikaya, which is the
basis of infinite qualities inseparable from Keval Darshan, is the only one
capable of possessing them. ||42||  In this way, the Gatha explains the use of
Darshan.

## 146 **Verse 3 of the Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas**
**Verse 43 of the Time Explanation**  This is the support for the fact that one
soul has many kinds of knowledge. The knower is not separate from knowledge,
knowledge is many, not one. Therefore, the substance is called the universal
form by the knowers. || 53 ||  The knower is not separate from knowledge,
because both are made of one existence, and therefore are one substance, because
both have an inseparable region, and therefore are one field, because both are
created at the same time, and therefore are one time, because both have the same
nature, and therefore are one essence. And even when this is said, many kinds of
knowledge, such as insight (mati), do not contradict each other in one soul,
because the substance is universal (multifaceted). The substance is truly
infinite in form, because it is the basis of infinite qualities that occur
together and infinite categories that occur in sequence. Therefore, even though
it is one, it is called the universal form (multifaceted). || 43 ||

The five astikayas are not distinct. There are many different types of
knowledge, such as mati, jnana, etc. Because there are many different types of
knowledge, the universe is described as having many forms. What is it? It is the
jiva dravya. Who said this? The jnanis, those who have knowledge of the
principles of heya and upadeya. As such, just as there is no difference between
a paramāṇu and its qualities like color, etc., because it is one in essence, one
in substance, one in space, one in time, and one in nature, so too there is no
difference between the jiva dravya and its qualities like knowledge, etc.,
because it is one in essence, one in substance, one in space, one in time, and
one in nature. Alternatively, in relation to the pure jiva, there is no
difference between the pure jiva and its qualities like infinite knowledge,
etc., because it is one in essence, one in substance, one in space, one in time,
and one in nature. This is the meaning.

## Chapter 148: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  **Verse
43:**  A substance is simply existence. Space is a substance because it is an
infinite, indivisible, pure, and unified region. Time is a substance because it
is a mere consequence of the continuous flow of the unchanging, conscious, and
miraculous. Nature is a substance because it is a pure, unified, and luminous
consciousness. The pure soul is not different from its infinite qualities, such
as pure knowledge, etc., in any way.  **Verse 44:**  **Commentary:**  If a
substance is different from its qualities, and qualities are different from the
substance, then this leads to a contradiction. If it is said that a substance is
different from its qualities, and qualities are different from the substance,
then it leads to the conclusion that there are infinite substances or that there
is no substance at all.  **Explanation:**  Qualities are always dependent on
something. The thing they depend on is the substance. If the substance is
different from the qualities, then the qualities will also be dependent on
something else. This will lead to an infinite regress. Therefore, if a substance
is different from its qualities, then there will be an infinite number of
substances.  On the other hand, if qualities are different from the substance,
then there will be no substance at all. Because a substance is a collection of
qualities, and if the qualities are different from the collection, then what is
the collection?  **Hindi Commentary:**  **Meaning:** If a substance is different
from its qualities, and qualities are different from the substance, then this
leads to a contradiction. If it is said that a substance is different from its
qualities, and qualities are different from the substance, then it leads to the
conclusion that there are infinite substances or that there is no substance at
all.  **Explanation:**  This is a contradiction. Qualities are always dependent
on something. The thing they depend on is the substance. If the substance is

**Verse 44**  The five-fold categories, beginning with the substance, are in
reality a collection of qualities. If the qualities are different from the
collection, then what will remain of the collection? That is, nothing will
remain. In this way, if the qualities are different from the substance, then the
substance is absent.  **Commentary**  This verse points out the flaw in the idea
that substance and qualities are distinct. If substance is different from
qualities, then either there would be an infinite number of substances, or
substance would cease to exist.  **Explanation**  If qualities are distinct from
substance, then they must either be dependent on substance or independent of it.
* **Dependent Qualities:** If qualities are dependent on substance, then there
would be an infinite number of substances. For example, if knowledge is a
quality that depends on a substance, then there would be an infinite number of
substances, each with its own knowledge. * **Independent Qualities:** If
qualities are independent of substance, then substance would cease to exist. For
example, if knowledge is a quality that is independent of substance, then there
would be no need for a substance to support it.  Therefore, the idea that
substance and qualities are distinct is flawed. The five-fold categories,
beginning with the substance, are in reality a collection of qualities.

## English Translation:  **Verse 150**  If someone were to raise another
objection, it would be this: If the infinite knowledge and other qualities,
which reside in a pure soul-substance, were to become separate from that soul-
substance, then similarly, in another pure soul-substance, the infinite
qualities would also become separate. This would lead to the conclusion that the
pure soul-substances would become infinite due to the separation of the infinite
qualities from them. Just as the infinity of the substance is stated in the case
of the substance of the Supreme Soul, which is capable of being grasped, due to
the distinction between qualities and the qualified, similarly, it should be
understood in the case of the impure soul-substance, which is capable of being
abandoned, and the substance of karma, etc. That is, with the distinction
between qualities and the qualified, each quality, whether primary or secondary,
would have a primary or secondary substance as its basis, and thus the substance
would become infinite. And when the qualities depart from the substance, the
substance would cease to exist, whereas it has been stated that the aggregate of
qualities is the substance. If a separation of the qualities from the substance,
which is in the form of an aggregate of qualities, is accepted, then where would
the substance, which is an aggregate of qualities, remain? It cannot remain in
any way. || 44 ||  **Verse 45**  **Commentary:** This is a statement about the
inherent non-duality of substance and qualities. The non-duality of substance
and qualities is accepted as being in the form of their inseparable location,
but their duality in the form of separate locations is not accepted. For
example, just as a single atom is non-dual with its single atomic location due
to their inseparability, similarly, the single atom and the qualities residing
in it, such as touch, taste, smell, color, etc., are non-dual due to their
inseparable location. Just as there is duality between two extremely distant
objects, such as the Vindhya mountains, and duality between two extremely close
objects, such as water and milk, which are mixed, due to their separate
locations, so also, there is no duality between substance and qualities due to
the absence of separate locations. || 45 ||  **Hindi Commentary:**  **Verse
45:**  **Meaning:** (द्रव्यगुणानाम्) The substance and qualities [अविभक्तम्
अनन्यत्वम्] are non-dual in the form of their inseparability, (निश्चयज्ञा: हिं)
those who know with certainty [तेषाम्] them [विभक्तम् अन्यत्वम] do not accept
their duality in the form of separability [वा] or (तद्विपरीतं) (duality in the
form of) inseparability (न इच्छन्ति).  **Explanation:** This is a statement
about the inherent non-duality of substance and qualities. The non-duality of
substance and qualities is accepted as being in the form of their inseparable
location, but their duality in the form of separate locations is not accepted.

The concept of "vibhaktpradeshtva-svrupa" (being distinct in terms of space) as
otherness and "vibhaktpradeshtva-svrupa" as non-otherness is not accepted. It is
explained clearly as follows: Just as an atom, due to its indivisibility in
terms of space, is non-other to its own space, similarly, an atom and the
qualities residing in it, such as touch, taste, smell, and color, due to their
indivisibility in terms of space, are non-other (avibhaktpradeshtva-svrupa).
However, just as the distant mountains Sahya and Vindhya are other to each other
due to their distinct spatial locations, and similarly, the mixed milk and water
are non-other due to their close proximity, in the same way, substances and
qualities are not other due to their non-distinct spatial locations
(vibhaktpradeshtva-svrupa) and are not non-other due to their distinct spatial
locations. ||45||

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  **Verse 45 of the Hindi
Commentary**  This verse further explains that there is a certain
inseparability, a unity, between substance and qualities.  **General Meaning
with Anvaya:**  (Davyagunaanam) The unity and inseparability (avibhattam,
anannatam) of substance and qualities (nichchayahu) are known to those who are
certain. (Vibhattam anannatam) They do not desire their separation and
difference (nichchati). (Va) Or (tersi) they do not accept (tabivaridam) their
opposite nature, i.e., their difference from their own nature, as being certain
(hi).  **Specific Meaning:**  Just as an atom is inseparable from its qualities
like color, etc., meaning there is no difference in their respective regions,
similarly, the pure soul substance is inseparable from its inherent qualities
like pure knowledge, etc., and the impure soul is inseparable from its inherent
qualities like perception and knowledge, etc., and the remaining substances are
inseparable from their respective qualities. It is necessary to understand that
there is no difference in the regions of substance and qualities. Those who are
certain, like the Jain Acharyas, do not accept that there is a difference
between the Himalayas and the Vindhya mountains, or that there is a difference
in the regions of water and milk when they are in the same area. Even though
they do not accept this difference between substance and qualities, they also do
not accept that substance and qualities are completely inseparable from each
other. In other words, just as there is inseparability in terms of regions
between substance and qualities, they do not accept that there is inseparability
in terms of designation, etc. In other words, they do not accept that substance
and qualities are either completely inseparable or completely separate. They do
not accept both unity and difference without any basis, but they accept both
natures based on different bases. Unity in terms of regions leads to
inseparability. The Acharyas believe that designation, etc., leads to difference
between substance and qualities.  The implication here is that the person who
experiences the taste of the nectar of supreme bliss, which is the unity and
non-dualistic supreme joy that comes from the pure knowledge and perception of
the self-essence, free from the objects and passions that are different from the
pure knowledge and perception of the self-essence, is the one who is worthy of
receiving that self. This self is one with countless pure regions, the size of
the space of the universe, and its qualities of pure knowledge, etc.  **Verse
45**  In this way, the explanation of the inseparability and separability
between quality and the qualified has been explained briefly in three verses.
These verses are numbers 43, 44, and 45.  **Note:**  The dependence of
designation, etc., on the difference between substance and qualities is rejected
here.

There are many designations, forms, numbers, and objects. They exist both in the
case of otherness and non-otherness of the substance-qualities.  For example,
the designation of the sixth case (षष्टीव्यपदेश) is in the otherness of
"Devadatta's cow," similarly, it is in the non-otherness of "the branch of the
tree," "the qualities of the substance."  Similarly, the designation of the case
(कारकव्यपदेश) is in the otherness of "Devadatta picks the fruit for Dhanadatta
with a goad in the garden on the tree," similarly, it is in the non-otherness of
"the clay makes itself into a pot by itself, for itself, from itself, in itself,
the soul knows the soul by the soul, for the soul, from the soul, in the soul."
Similarly, the form (संस्थान) is in the otherness of "tall Devadatta's tall
cow," similarly, it is in the non-otherness of "the large branch-cluster of the
large tree," "the concrete qualities of the concrete substance."  Similarly, the
number is in the otherness of "ten cows of one Devadatta," similarly, it is in
the non-otherness of "ten branches of one tree," "infinite qualities of one
substance."  Similarly, the object (विषय) is in the otherness of "cows in the
cowshed," similarly, it is in the non-otherness of "branches in the tree,"
"qualities in the substance."  Therefore, designations, etc., do not establish
the difference of substance-qualities as reality.

The description of the six substances and five categories is similar to how
"branches are in a tree" and "qualities are in a substance" - they are both
inherently present. Therefore, naming, form, number, and object do not prove a
difference in substance and qualities. ॥46॥

**Pancastikaya Prabhrit**  155. The **Nayaayika** (logician) who holds the
special view says, "If there is no distinction between substance and qualities
in isolation, then designation etc. are not established." The answer to this is
that even if there is distinction between substance and qualities in some
respects and non-distinction in some respects, designation etc. can still occur.
For example, the sixth case and the agent, object, instrument, recipient,
separation, and location, these six cases are of two types. In one type of
distinction, for example, "Devadatta's cow" is said, and in the other type of
non-distinction, for example, "the branch of the tree," "the infinite knowledge
etc. qualities of the soul." The case is explained as follows: "Devadatta, the
man named, being the agent, breaks the fruit-like object with his goad-like
instrument for Dhanadatta in the garden-like location from the tree." This is an
example of the case in distinction, in which all six cases are different.
Similarly, "the soul, being the agent, contemplates its own soul-like object
with its own soul-like instrument for the sake of its own soul in its own soul-
like location near its own soul-like base." This is an example of the six cases
in non-distinction. In both these examples, the distinction and non-distinction
of the case are explained. Now, the aspect of size is explained. "Devadatta is
tall" is the same as "the house is large" in distinction, and "the long branch
of the long tree is heavy" and "the concrete substance has concrete qualities"
are the same in non-distinction.  Now, the aspect of number is explained.
"Devadatta has ten villages" is the number in distinction, and similarly, "the
tree has ten branches" or "the substance has infinite qualities" is the number
in non-distinction. Here, in the verse, the meaning of the word "vishaya"
(object) is "base," which is shown as follows: "There are cows in the "gostha"
(cowshed)" is the object in distinction, and similarly, "there are qualities in
the substance" is the object in non-distinction. In this way, designation etc.
are established in both distinction and non-distinction, therefore, the
distinction between substance and qualities in isolation is not established.  In
this verse, the **Jivaastikaya** (soul) which is not definitely named as "man,"
"hell-being," etc., which are born from name-karma-udaya (the rise of karma
related to name), and which is not definitely associated with the six bodies,
such as the square, etc., is still, in terms of convention, according to the
previous logic, associated with a body of a size slightly smaller than the final
body, and which is infinite in number due to its infinite qualities, such as
omniscience, etc., is still associated with an infinite number due to having an
infinite number of pure regions according to the evidence of the world and
space, and which is not the object of the five senses, which are the enjoyers of
the pleasure of the objects of the five senses, is still, due to the feeling of
the pure soul devoid of the objects of the five senses, the object of the
contemplation of the one pleasure-form, which is free from attachment and
eternally blissful, which contemplation is transforming into the feeling of
supreme equality-rasa (taste) in all the regions of the soul, such a pure
**Jivaastikaya** soul is the one that is to be grasped. This is the meaning. ||

## Chapter 156: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  **Verse
47:**  This is an example of the difference and non-difference of reality. Just
as wealth and knowledge make a man wealthy and knowledgeable respectively, in
two ways, so too do the wise say that there is both separateness and oneness.
**Commentary:**  Just as wealth, which is made up of different existences,
different locations, different numbers, and different objects, makes a man
wealthy, so too knowledge, which is made up of non-different existences, non-
different locations, non-different numbers, and non-different objects, makes a
man knowledgeable. This is how we should understand it in other cases as well.
Where there is a difference in the substance, there is separateness. Where there
is no difference in the substance, there is oneness.

##  Verse 47: An Example of Distinction and Non-Distinction with Certainty  Now,
an example of distinction and non-distinction with certainty is explained:
Knowledge (**naan**) makes the knower (**naanin**) and wealth (**dhan**) makes
the wealthy (**dhanin**). What does it do? It makes the wealthy (**dhanin**) and
the knower (**naanin**) in two ways, through two kinds of reasoning, through two
kinds of certainties in conduct. Just as, they say, "They speak, thus": What do
they say? Separateness and oneness. Who says it? The knowers of truth.  Just as,
wealth, having a separate existence, is distinct from the person having a
separate existence, and has a different name, a different location, a different
number, a different subject matter, and a different basis, so the wealthy is
designated as such due to the separateness of the doer. Similarly, knowledge,
having a non-separate existence, is non-distinct from the person having a non-
separate existence, and has a non-distinct name, a non-distinct location, a non-
distinct number, a non-distinct subject matter, and a non-distinct basis, so the
knower is designated as such due to the non-separateness of the doer.  The
explanation of the example has been given. Similarly, in the case of giving,
where there is a designation based on the distinction of the desired object,
there, with certainty, distinction should be known, as explained in the previous
verses, like Devadatta's cow, etc. Where, however, there is a designation based
on non-distinction, there, with certainty, non-distinction should be known, like
the branches of a tree, the infinite knowledge of the soul, etc.  In this sutra,
whatever is non-distinct in name, non-distinct in location, non-distinct in
number, and non-distinct in subject matter, that soul makes the knower. Just as,
due to ignorance, etc., the soul wanders in the states of human, hell, etc., so,
whatever is the seed of the tree of liberation, whose power of contemplation
overcomes all the fields of objects, time, and existence, that very thing bears
the fruit of pure knowledge. This non-changing, self-aware knowledge should be
contemplated by the knowers.

The description of the six substances and the five astikayas is inseparable from
knowledge, the establishment of knowledge is inseparable from the knower, the
establishment of the knower is inseparable from knowledge, the number of
knowledge is inseparable from the knower, the number of the knower is
inseparable from knowledge, the basis of knowledge is inseparable from the
knower, the basis of the knower is inseparable from knowledge. In this way,
there is a statement of inseparability or non-duality between knowledge and the
knower. According to these two examples, one should consider the dartant view,
where there are different substances, their names and so on should be known
differently. For example, in the previous story, the example of Devadatta and
the cow was given. Where the names and so on are said to be inseparable in the
same substance, there one should know the inseparability with certainty. For
example, the branches of a tree or the infinite knowledge etc. qualities of a
living being etc. Here, in this sutra, the one who is inseparably described with
the living being, has an inseparable establishment, inseparable number,
inseparable basis, and who is called the knower of the living being, without
whose benefit this living being has been wandering in the realms of hell, human
beings, etc. since time immemorial, and who is truly the seed of the tree of
liberation, and whose contemplation, as a result of which, without any order,
all substances, fields, time, and emotions are known, the pure, perfect
knowledge of all kinds arises, that is, the contemplation of that unchanging
self-awareness knowledge is to be done by the knowers, this is the meaning.
||47|| Time Explanation Verse 48 The fault is in the fact that the qualities of
the substance are different from each other. The knower and knowledge are always
different from each other. The right Jain view leads to the conclusion that both
are non-sentient. ||48|| The knower and knowledge are always different from each
other. The right Jain view leads to the conclusion that both are non-sentient.
||48|| If the knower is different from knowledge, then he would be non-sentient
because he would be unable to perform actions without the help of knowledge,
just like a lifeless axe cannot cut without a person holding it. Similarly, if
knowledge is different from the knower, then it would be non-sentient because it
would be unable to perform actions without the help of the knower, just like a
lifeless axe cannot cut without a person holding it. And, knowledge and the
knower cannot be considered sentient together because the substance is without
any special characteristics, and the qualities are without any support, and are
empty. ||48|| Hindi Time Explanation Verse 48 Anvayaarth - (Knower) If the
knower [soul] [and] (knowledge) knowledge [always] always (of each other)
mutually (different from each other) different from each other (different from
each other) then {both. Both (non-sentient) non-sentient (arises) arises (right
Jain view) such is the right Jain view.

##  Translation:  159. If the five *astikayas* (categories of existence) and
their attributes are considered to be distinct entities, then the following
flaws arise:  If the knower (soul) is distinct from knowledge, then the soul,
like a Devadatta without an axe, will be unable to perform the action of
knowledge due to the absence of its instrumental aspect, and thus will be
unconscious. Similarly, if knowledge is distinct from the knower (soul), then
knowledge, like an axe without Devadatta, will be unable to perform the action
of its agent due to the absence of its agent aspect, and thus will be
unconscious. Furthermore, it is not possible for consciousness to arise from the
combination of knowledge and the knower (soul) as distinct entities, because
non-specific substance and the void without support are devoid of attributes. In
other words, substance without attributes and attributes without a substance-
like support are impossible. ||48||  **Sanskrit Commentary Verse 48:**  This
verse shows the flaw in considering knowledge and the knower (soul) as
completely distinct. If the knower (soul) and knowledge are completely distinct,
then what is the flaw? The flaw is that both knowledge and the knower (soul)
will be unconscious (inert). How is this inertness? It is a complete rejection
of the teachings of the Jinas. Just as heat, which is completely distinct from
the fire, is capable of burning, but is certainly cold in the absence of fire,
similarly, knowledge, which is completely distinct from the soul, is capable of
understanding objects, but is certainly inert in the absence of the soul. Just
as fire, which is completely distinct from the heat, is capable of burning, but
is certainly cold in the absence of heat, similarly, the soul, which is
completely distinct from knowledge, is capable of understanding objects, but is
certainly inert in the absence of knowledge. Some may argue that just as
Devadatta becomes a cutter with a separate axe, similarly, the knower (soul)
becomes a knower with separate knowledge. This is not correct. The axe is an
external instrument for cutting, while the special power of the man, which
arises from the absence of obstacles to his effort, is the internal instrument.
In the absence of this power, the axe, even with the hand, cannot cut.
Similarly, in the absence of the internal instrument of knowledge, even with the
external support of light, etc., the man cannot understand objects. Therefore,
due to the absence of knowledge, the soul becomes inert and wanders in the
world, unable to attain the ultimate happiness of eternal bliss, which is free
from attachment and is the natural beauty of the pure soul. This knowledge of
the pure soul, which is free from attachment and other defilements, is the one
that should be attained. ||48||  **Hindi Commentary Verse 48:**  This verse
shows the flaw in considering knowledge and the knower (soul) as completely
distinct. If you consider knowledge to be completely separate from the knower
(soul), then what is the flaw?

## Six Substances - Description of the Five Astikayas, Verse 3  **Meaning with
Anvaya:** (The) Knower (soul) (and) his knowledge (are) (always) different from
each other (if) they are different substances (then) both the soul and knowledge
(will) become (inanimate) (this) is (well) the statement of the Jinas.
**Detailed Meaning:** Just as if fire, the possessor of the quality of heat,
becomes completely different from its quality of heat, then the fire will
certainly become cold, unable to perform the action of burning, similarly, if
the living being, the possessor of the quality of knowledge, becomes different
from its quality of knowledge, then it will become inert, unable to know the
object. Just as fire is considered completely different from the quality of
heat, then it becomes cold, unable to perform the action of burning, similarly,
if the knowing living being is considered completely different from the quality
of knowledge, then it becomes inert, unable to know the object. Then it will be
like Devadatta is different from his chisel, which cuts the grass, similarly,
the knower is different from knowledge, this cannot be said. The chisel is only
an external instrument for the action of cutting, but the internal instrument is
the special potency of the man, which arises from the destruction and cessation
of the obstacles to potency. If there is no inner power, then even with the
chisel in hand, the work of cutting cannot be done. Similarly, even with the
external cooperative causes like light, gravity, etc., if there is no internal
instrument of knowledge in the man, then he cannot perform the action of knowing
the object. Here the implication is that the living being, who is inert due to
the lack of knowledge, does not know the ultimate happiness, which is free from
attachment, natural, beautiful, and full of joy, and is wandering in the world,
should accept his pure self-experienced knowledge, which is free from
attachment, etc.  **Verse 49:**  This is the refutation of the relationship of
samvaya between knowledge and the knower.  For he is not different from
knowledge due to samvaya, the knower is not different from knowledge.  And the
statement that he is ignorant is a proof of oneness.  **Translation of Verse
49:**  It is not established that the man, who is different from knowledge,
becomes a knower due to the samvaya of knowledge. He is not different from
knowledge due to samvaya, the knower is not different from knowledge. And the
statement that he is ignorant is a proof of oneness.  **Note:** The translation
preserves the Jain terms like "samvaya" and "astikaya" as requested.

"Is the soul, prior to the union with knowledge, a knower or a non-knower? If it
is a knower, then the union with knowledge is futile. If it is a non-knower,
then is it a non-knower due to the union with non-knowledge, or due to being one
with non-knowledge? It cannot be due to the union with non-knowledge, for the
union of a non-knower with non-knowledge is futile, and knowingness does not
exist in the absence of the union with knowledge. Therefore, the statement 'non-
knower' necessarily establishes oneness with non-knowledge. And since oneness
with non-knowledge is established, oneness with knowledge is also necessarily
established."

becomes manifest as the clouds disperse, similarly, **Kevala Jnana** (perfect
knowledge), which is the unhindered, all-encompassing knowledge of the three
realms and all their contents, illuminating infinite Dharmas, exists in the Jiva
(soul) from the beginning. However, due to the influence of **Karma** (actions),
it remains obscured in the realm of **Vyavahara** (practical life). As the
**Karma** veil dissipates, **Kevala Jnana** gradually becomes manifest. This
knowledge is not something external to the Jiva, nor does it become connected to
the Jiva through **Samavaya** (inherent connection) at a later stage.   **Hindi
Commentary Verse 49:**  If one considers **Jnana** (knowledge) to be completely
separate from the **Jnani** (knower), then even **Samavaya** (inherent
connection) cannot establish their unity.  **General Meaning with Anvaya (word
order):**  **Jnana** (knowledge) is completely different from the **Jiva**
(soul), and the **Jiva** is not connected to the **Jnani** (knower) through
**Samavaya** (inherent connection). This statement makes the unity of **guna**
(quality) and **gunin** (possessor of the quality) a possibility.  **Specific
Meaning:**  Two questions arise: Before the **Samavaya** connection of **Jnana**
with the **Jiva**, was the **Jiva** a **Jnani** (knower) or an **Ajnani** (non-
knower)? If one says that the **Jiva** was a **Jnani**, then the **Samavaya**
connection of **Jnana** becomes meaningless, as the **Jiva** was already a
**Jnani**. If one says that the **Jiva** was an **Ajnani**, then two further
questions arise: Was the **Jiva** an **Ajnani** due to the **Samavaya**
connection of the **Ajnanaguna** (quality of ignorance) or due to its inherent
nature? If the **Jiva** was an **Ajnani** due to the **Samavaya** connection of
the **Ajnanaguna**, then the **Samavaya** connection becomes meaningless, as the
**Jiva** was already an **Ajnani**. If one accepts that the **Jiva** was an
**Ajnani** by nature, then why not accept that **Ajnanatva** (ignorance) is also
inherent by nature? After all, **Jnana** is a **guna** (quality) of the **Atma**
(soul), and **guna** and **gunin** are not separate.  The essence of this verse
is that just as the sun's light exists even when covered by clouds, and becomes
manifest as the clouds disperse, similarly, **Kevala Jnana** exists in the
**Jiva** from the beginning. However, due to the influence of **Karma**, it
remains obscured in the realm of **Vyavahara**. As the **Karma** veil
dissipates, **Kevala Jnana** gradually becomes manifest. This knowledge is not
something external to the **Jiva**, nor does it become connected to the **Jiva**
through **Samavaya** at a later stage.

##  Translation:  **Verse 50**  This verse refutes the existence of any other
entity (padartha) besides the samvaya.  **Explanation:**  * **Samvartattva**
(co-existence) is the samvaya. * **Apritagbhutatva** (non-separateness) is also
the samvaya. * **Ayutasiddhatva** (non-separate existence) is also the samvaya.
Therefore, it is stated that **Ayutasiddhi** (non-separate existence) is the
characteristic of dravyas (substances) and gunas (qualities).  **Commentary:**
The co-existence of dravyas and gunas, being non-beginning and non-ending, is
the samvartattva. This is the samvaya according to the Jains. Due to the non-
separateness of dravyas and gunas, even though there are differences in names
and other aspects, they are non-separate in reality. The absence of any other
entity that is the cause of their existence is the ayutasiddhatva. Therefore,
the dravyas and gunas, which have the characteristic of samvaya, are
characterized by ayutasiddhi, not by apritagbhutatva.  **Hindi Explanation:**
This verse refutes the existence of any other entity (padartha) besides the
samvaya.  * **Samvartattva** (co-existence) is the samvaya. *
**Apritagbhutatva** (non-separateness) is also the samvaya. * **Ayutasiddhatva**
(non-separate existence) is also the samvaya.  Therefore, it is stated that
**Ayutasiddhi** (non-separate existence) is the characteristic of dravyas
(substances) and gunas (qualities).  **Sanskrit Explanation:**  This verse
refutes the existence of any other entity (padartha) besides the samvaya.  *

separateness) is also the samvaya. * **Ayutasiddhatva** (non-separate existence)

## Chapter 164, Verse 3: Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas
Here, in this explanation, it should be understood that the relationship of
inherent oneness (tadātmya-sambandha) with the soul, beginning from the
knowledge-quality, is established. Similarly, it should be believed and
understood that the soul has an inherent oneness with the infinite qualities
that are included in pure knowledge, such as the unhindered, unmeasurable,
imperishable, natural, free from the defects of attachment, etc., and the
ultimate bliss that is the sole nature of the soul. This should be constantly
meditated upon by abandoning all the alternatives of attachment, etc. || 50 ||
Thus, two verses have been spoken, primarily refuting the concept of samvāya
(co-existence).

This is a concluding section of the explanation of the five categories
(Panchaastikaya) and their characteristics (guna) in the context of time
(samaya). It uses the example of the four qualities (varna, rasa, gandha,
sparsa) to explain the concept of non-duality (ananta) between substance
(dravya) and its qualities.  **Verse 51:**  The four qualities (varna, rasa,
gandha, sparsa) are formed from the atoms (paramanu) and are distinct from the
substance (dravya) due to their specific characteristics. They are not separate
from the substance in essence, but appear distinct due to their specific
characteristics.  **Verse 52:**  Similarly, knowledge (jnana) and perception
(darsana) are connected to the soul (jiva) and are not separate from the soul in
essence. They appear distinct due to their specific characteristics, but in
reality, they are always inseparable from the soul.  **Explanation:**  The four
qualities (varna, rasa, gandha, sparsa) are formed from the atoms (paramanu) and
are not separate from the substance (dravya) in essence. They appear distinct
due to their specific characteristics, such as their name and description.
Similarly, knowledge (jnana) and perception (darsana) are connected to the soul
(jiva) and are not separate from the soul in essence. They appear distinct due
to their specific characteristics, such as their name and description. However,
in reality, they are always inseparable from the soul.  This section concludes
the explanation of the qualities (guna) related to use (upayoga). The next
section will discuss the qualities (guna) related to action (kartṛtva).

## 166 ## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  Even though they
are non-different due to being in the same location, they are made distinct by
the specific characteristics that are the cause of their designation, such as
name and so on. In this way, knowledge and perception, which are connected to
the soul, are also non-different due to being in the same location as the soul
substance, but they are made distinct by the specific characteristics that are
the cause of their designation, such as name and so on. However, they inherently
always remain non-distinct. ||51 52||  This concludes the explanation of the
utility quality. Now, the explanation of the causative quality. Its introduction
(preface) is done in the first three verses.  [Sanskrit Commentary] Verses 51-52
Now, the conclusion of the explanation of the non-difference of substances and
qualities is stated in the form of an example and illustration. The color,
taste, smell, and touch are said to be in the form of atoms, which are the form
of the atomic substance. By what are they made distinct? By specific
characteristics - specific characteristics, such as name, definition, purpose,
and other differences, or, as per the alternative reading, "specific
characteristics are specific characteristics," specific characteristics are the
qualities and characteristics of the substance, which are inherently clear. How
are they like this? They are from the substance - from the atomic substance,
they are non-different by definition. They become different by effort - they
become distinct by designation, such as name and so on, according to the later
practical approach. Thus, the verse of the example has passed.  [Sanskrit
Commentary] Perception and knowledge are also like this - perception and
knowledge are two. How are they like this? They are two, being connected to the
soul. Again, how are they like this? They are non-different in the form of
location, being countless by definition. What do they do in this way? They make
distinctness and diversity by designation, by difference in name and so on. It
is clear that they are not inherently different by definition.  [Sanskrit
Commentary] In this section, even though the distinction between pure and impure
was not made during the explanation of the eight types of knowledge and the four
types of perception, it should be understood that the two types of knowledge and
perception, which are the cause of the attainment of the ultimate happiness,
which is characterized by freedom from anxiety, in the supreme soul, which is
the ultimate bliss and the ultimate consciousness, free from beginning, middle,
and end, are the objects of attainment. It should also be understood that they
are the objects of meditation, by abandoning the knowledge that is mixed with
anger, fear, and so on. ||51-52||  Thus, the two verses have passed in the form
of an example and illustration. [Sanskrit Commentary] Here, first, the five
verses in the middle, in the form of the statement of perception and knowledge,
in the order of the previously mentioned text, starting with "Uvaogo duviyappu,"
and then, the ten verses in the middle, in the form of the refutation of the
difference between the quality and the qualified, against the Naiyayikas, in the
order of the text starting with "Na vigrapyadi naanado," make a total of
nineteen verses, which are the sixth section, "Upayogaadhikaara," in the nine
sections of the explanation of the soul. [Hindi Commentary] Verses 51-52
Uththānikā - Further, giving an example and illustration, the author says, while
contracting the explanation of the non-difference between substance and
qualities. [Hindi Commentary] Anvaya-sahith saamaanyaarth - (Hindi) By
definition (vaṇṇarasagandhapāsā) color, taste, smell, touch (paramaṇurūvidā) are
said to be in the form of atoms (visesā) qualities (davvādō ya aṇpaṇā)

The five astikayas, beginning with pudgala dravya, are inseparable, yet they are
distinct in terms of (anṇattapagāsagā) behavior, as they are the illuminators of
the difference in terms of cognition, etc. (hoti) (taha) similarly,
(jīvaṇibaddhāṇi) those related to the soul in terms of identity, (daṃsaṇṇāṇāṇi)
perception and knowledge qualities (ṇṇṇabhūdāṇi) are inseparable from the soul,
but (vavadesado) they are (puḍhattaṃ) mutually distinct in terms of cognition,
etc. (kuvyanti). (hi) They are not distinct in terms of (sabhāvādo ṇ) nature.
**Special Meaning:** Just as the qualities of touch, etc., are inseparable from
the pudgala atom, so too are the qualities of knowledge and perception
inseparable from the soul. Just as the touch, taste, smell, and color of an atom
are distinct, so too is the soul distinct from its qualities of knowledge and
perception.  Here, the implication is that although the eight types of
knowledge-use and four types of perception-use were not discussed in terms of
purity and impurity, it should be understood that the supreme soul, which is
free from beginning, middle, and end, and is full of supreme bliss and
consciousness, is worthy of being grasped. The two uses, namely, perfect
perception and perfect knowledge, are the causes of the happiness that is worthy
of being grasped, which is the characteristic of the ultimate happiness that is
free from all suffering. These two uses alone are worthy of being meditated
upon, abandoning all the nets of choices, such as the sorrowful, the fierce,
etc.  Thus, two verses were spoken in the form of an example and a statement.
Here, first, five to nine verses were spoken, mentioning perception and
knowledge in the order of the previous evidence text, "Uvaogo duviyapyō," etc.
Then, ten verses were spoken in four different places, removing the distinction
between the quality and the qualified, in the order of the text, "ṇ
viyappadināṇādo," etc., for the sake of the logician. In this way, the sixth use
chapter, in the form of the explanation of the soul chapter, was completed in
the nine chapters, through the 18 verses in the form of a community.  **Verse
53:**  **Time Explanation:**  Jīvā aṇāi-ṇihaṇā saṃtā ṇatā ya jīva-bhāvādo.
Sabbhāvādo aṇantā pañcagg-guṇappadhānā ya.  Jīvā anādinidhanāḥ sāntā anantāśca
jīvabhāvāt. Sadbhavato'nantāḥ pañcāgraguṇapradhānāśca.  The souls are without
beginning and end, they are finite and infinite, because of the nature of the
soul. They are infinite in terms of their nature, and they are primarily
characterized by the five sense organs and their qualities.  The souls are
certainly the doers of their own nature, because they are not the doers of the
nature of others. And those who do these things...

##  Verse 168:  **Description of the Sixfold and Fivefold**  Whether they are
without beginning or end, whether they are finite, whether they are infinite,
whether they are transformed into that form, whether they are not transformed,
this is a matter of doubt.    **Explanation:**  Since souls are without
beginning or end by nature, due to their inherent characteristic of
consciousness, they are finite in terms of their arising, diminishing, and
quiescent states.  They are infinite in terms of their diminishing state.  It is
not possible for the diminishing state to be finite due to its inherent nature.
When the limiting conditions are removed, the soul's true nature, like the state
of a liberated soul, is the state of being.  And due to this state of being,
souls are considered to be infinite.    It is not appropriate to say that there
are other states of being for those who are without beginning or end, with the
inherent characteristic of consciousness, that are finite or infinite.  They are
indeed experienced as being dominated by the five primary qualities, because
they are transformed into that form, like water contaminated with mud, due to
the impurities of their karmic actions, which are without beginning.

##  Verse 161  **Translation:**  **Verse 53**  Following the previous eighteen
verses, which described the relationship between the pure soul and the world in
a general way, this verse now delves into the details of the three aspects of
karma: **karm-kritrutva** (being the doer of karma), **bhoktṛutva** (being the
experiencer of karma), and **samyuktatva** (being connected to karma). This is
done through five different sections, starting with the phrase "**Jīva
aṇāiṇihaṇā**" (Souls are without beginning and end).  **Explanation:**  First,
the verse describes the nature and number of souls who will be discussed in
relation to these three aspects of karma.  **Jīva aṇāiṇihaṇā** - Souls are
without beginning and end. They are pure and eternal, existing in their true
form, which is pure consciousness.  **Saṃtā-audayika-kṣāyopaśamika-aupamika-
bhāvanāyā-apeksyā mādinidhanāḥ** - However, in relation to the states of
**saṃtā** (existence), **audayika** (arising), **kṣāya** (decay), and
**upaśamika** (subduing), they appear to have a beginning and end.  **Aṇantā ya-
sādhanāntāḥ** - They are infinite in number, with no limit to their potential.
**Kasmat-sakaśāt?** - Why?  **Jīva-bhāvādo-jīva-abhāvataḥ kṣāyika-bhāvaḥ
tasmāt** - Because the state of decay arises from the soul's own nature, not
from something external.  **Na hi kṣāyika-bhāvasya sādittvād-antopi kila
bhaviṣyatīty-āśaṅkanīyaṃ** - It is not possible for the state of decay to have
an end, as it is an inherent part of the soul's nature.  **Sa hi karma-kṣaye
sati kṣāyika-bhāvaḥ kevala-jñānādirūpeṇa samutpadyamānaḥ siddha-bhāva iva
jīvasya sad-bhāva eva sa ca svabhāvasya vināśo nāsti ceti** - When karma is
destroyed, the state of decay transforms into pure knowledge and other such
qualities, becoming an inherent part of the soul's existence. Since the soul's
true nature is eternal, the state of decay cannot be destroyed.  **Anādy-
nidhana-sahaja-śuddha-pāriṇāmika-eka-bhāvānaṃ sādini-dhanāny-apy-
audayikādibhavāntarāṇi kathaṃ sambhavantīti cet?** - If the soul is eternal and
pure, how can states like **audayika** (arising) and others arise?  **Pañca-gga-
guṇa-ppahaṇā ya- yadyapi svabhāvanā śuddha-astathāpi vyavahāreṇā-nādika-karma-
bandha-vaśāt-sakardama-jalavada-audayikādibhavātra-pariṇatā dṛśyanta iti
svārūpa-vyākhyānaṃ gataṃ** - Although the soul is inherently pure, due to the
karmic bond, it appears to be impure and subject to the cycle of birth and
death, like mud mixed with water. This is the explanation of the soul's nature.
**Idānīṃ saṃkhyāṃ kathayati sambhavado aṇantā-dravya-svabhāva-gaṇanayā punag-
gnānāḥ** - Now, the verse explains the number of souls. They are infinite, based
on the infinite nature of the soul.  **Sāntānānta-śabdāyor-dvitīya-vyākhyānaṃ
kriyate-sahaṃtena saṃsāra-vināśena vartana sānnā bhanȳāḥ, na vitataḥ saṃsāra-
vināśo yeṣāṃ te punar-anantā abhavyāsta ce abhavyā ananta-saṃkhyāṃ tebhyāpi
bhavyā ananta-guṇa-saṃkhyāsta tebhyopya-bhavyā-samāna-bhavyā ananta-guṇā iti** -
The words **sānta** (finite) and **anānta** (infinite) have a second meaning.
Those who are **sānta** are those who will eventually end their cycle of birth
and death. Those who are **anānta** are those who will never end their cycle of
birth and death. There are an infinite number of **abhavyā** (those who will
never attain liberation), and an infinite number of **bhavyā** (those who will
attain liberation). And there are an infinite number of **abhavyā** who are
equal to the **bhavyā** in number.  **Atra sūtre anādinidhanā anan-jñānādidhārāḥ
śuddha-jīvā eva sādini-dhanamithyātvārāgādidosa-pariharā-pāṅgaṇānāṃ 'bhaya nāmu-
pāda ya iti tātparyārthaḥ** - This verse emphasizes that the pure souls, who are
without beginning and end, are the only ones who can truly overcome the false
beliefs, attachments, and other negative qualities that lead to suffering. The
phrase "**bhaya nāmu-pāda ya**" (those who have overcome fear) signifies this.
**End of Verse 53**

##  Verse 170: Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Categories  **Verse
3:**  With respect to (the category of) **Aṇaiṇihaṇā** (non-destruction), they
are **anādi** (beginningless) and **ananta** (infinite). With respect to (the
category of) **sānta** (finite), they are **sānta** (finite) and **ananta**
(infinite). In this way, they are **pañcaggaguṇappadhānā** (possessors of five
types of virtues) and **sattapākī** (possessors of two types of powers).
**Explanation:**  These living beings are pure **chaitanyarūpa** (consciousness)
in nature, according to the **śuddha dravyārthika** (pure substance-based)
**naya** (perspective), which perceives them as possessing pure **pāriṇāmika**
(transformational) **paramabhāva** (ultimate state). Therefore, they are
**anādi** (beginningless) and **ananta** (infinite), meaning that their
**pāriṇāmika** (transformational) state always exists. With respect to the
**audhayika** (active), **kṣayopśamika** (subduing), and **aupaśamika**
(subdued) states, they are **sānta** (finite). These three states arise and
cease due to the **udaya** (arising), **upaśama** (subduing), or **kṣayopśama**
(subduing and destruction) of **karma** (karmic actions). With respect to the
**kṣayika** (destroyed) states, they are **sānta** (finite) and **ananta**
(infinite). The **kṣayika** (destroyed) states should not be considered
**sādisānta** (finite and beginningless), because they arise from the
destruction of **karma** (karmic actions) in the form of **kevala jñāna**
(perfect knowledge) and other qualities, and they remain forever. These states
are the natural states of a living being, similar to those of a **siddhājīva**
(liberated soul), and nature is never destroyed. Although these living beings
are pure by nature, due to their **karmabandha** (bondage to karma) from
**anādikāla** (beginningless time), they are seen to transform into
**audhayika** (active) and other states, like water mixed with mud. This is how
their nature is explained.  Now, regarding the number, it is said that these
living beings are **ananta** (infinite) in number, based on the
**dravyasvabhāva** (nature of substance). This means that their number is
**akṣaya ananta** (infinite and indestructible).  The word **sānta ananta**
(finite and infinite) has another explanation: those living beings whose
**samsāra** (cycle of birth and death) can end are **sānta** (finite), meaning
they are **bhavyas** (those who can attain liberation). Those whose **samsāra**
(cycle of birth and death) cannot end are **ananta** (infinite), meaning they
are **abhavya** (those who cannot attain liberation). These **abhavya** (those
who cannot attain liberation) living beings are **ananta** (infinite) in number.
Among them, there are **anantaguṇe** (infinitely more) **bhavyas** (those who
can attain liberation). Among these **bhavyas** (those who can attain
liberation), there are **anantaguṇe** (infinitely more) **abhavya** (those who
cannot attain liberation) who are similar to **bhavyas** (those who can attain
liberation) and whose **samsāra** (cycle of birth and death) will never end.
The meaning of this verse is that those **bhavyas** (those who can attain
liberation) who are **sādisānta** (finite and beginningless) and who transform
by abandoning **mithyātva** (falsehood), **rāga** (attachment), and other
**doṣas** (faults), are capable of being **guṇita** (transformed) by the **anādi
ananta** (beginningless and infinite) **anantajñāna** (infinite knowledge) and
other qualities of the pure living beings.  ## Verse 54: Explanation of Time
**Verse 54:**  This is the resolution of the contradiction regarding the
**sādisaniḍhanatva** (finite and beginningless) and **sādyaniḍhanatva** (finite
and ending) of the living being's state.  **The Jinas have said:**  "The
destruction of the **sat** (real) is the birth of the **asat** (unreal) for the
living being."  This is a statement that is both **anyonyaviruḍdha**
(contradictory) and **aviruḍdha** (non-contradictory).  **Explanation:**  The
Jinas have said that the destruction of the **sat** (real) is the birth of the
**asat** (unreal) for the living being. This statement appears contradictory
because it seems to imply that the **sat** (real) can be destroyed and the
**asat** (unreal) can be born. However, it is also non-contradictory because it
is referring to the **pāriṇāmika** (transformational) states of the living
being, which are constantly changing. The **sat** (real) state is the
**pāriṇāmika** (transformational) state of the living being that is **anādi**
(beginningless) and **ananta** (infinite). The **asat** (unreal) state is the
**pāriṇāmika** (transformational) state of the living being that is **sānta**
(finite) and **anādi** (beginningless). The destruction of the **sat** (real)
state is the cessation of the **pāriṇāmika** (transformational) state that is
**anādi** (beginningless) and **ananta** (infinite). The birth of the **asat**
(unreal) state is the arising of the **pāriṇāmika** (transformational) state
that is **sānta** (finite) and **anādi** (beginningless). Therefore, the
statement is both **anyonyaviruḍdha** (contradictory) and **aviruḍdha** (non-
contradictory) because it is referring to the **pāriṇāmika** (transformational)
states of the living being, which are constantly changing.

##  Translation:  **Verse 54**  Thus, this living being, undergoing
transformation through five states, sometimes experiences the destruction of its
existence in the form of a human being, etc., due to the influence of a single,
finite state. And sometimes, it experiences the creation of its existence in the
form of a god, etc., due to the influence of another, infinite state. This seems
to contradict the previously mentioned aphorism, "There is no destruction of the
existent, nor creation of the non-existent." Because, according to the
**dravyaarthika** (substance-based) interpretation, there is no destruction of
the existent, nor creation of the non-existent. However, according to the
**paryayarthika** (modification-based) interpretation, there is destruction of
the existent and creation of the non-existent. This is not contradictory
because, just as we see the impermanence of waves in the ever-present water, so
too, the destruction and creation of existence are seen in the context of the
ever-present living being.

**Verse 3 of the Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas**  **Verse
54**  It is due to their mutual relativity. Here, although the living substance
is said to be finite and infinite due to the theory of synonyms, yet the pure
conviction is that only the substance which is eternal, infinite, marked by the
single nature of the knower, free from change, and eternally blissful, is worthy
of acceptance.  **Hindi Meaning**  **Verse 54**  The verse further states that
although there is birth and death according to the theory of synonyms, there is
no birth and death according to the theory of substance. There is no
contradiction in saying this.  **General Meaning with Anvaya**  (Thus) as stated
above, according to the theory of synonyms, (of the living being) there is birth
of the non-existent synonym (of the living being) (because) the Jinas have said
(so). This is contradictory, yet it is not contradictory.  **Specific Meaning**
As stated in the previous verse, according to the theory of the arising state,
the human synonym, which is now existent, is destroyed due to the destruction of
the lifespan, and due to the arising of the karma of motion, the non-existent
synonym of the gods etc. is born. This is what the omniscient Lord has said.
Earlier, in the introduction to the description of the substance, it was said
that there is no destruction of the existent living substance in the form of
being, and no birth of the non-existent living substance in the form of non-
being. Here it is said that the existent living being is destroyed and the non-
existent living being is produced. Therefore, there will be a contradiction. So
the Acharya says that there is no contradiction because in the introduction to
the substance, the destruction and production of the substance is denied
according to the theory of substance. Here, it is said that production and
destruction occur according to the theory of synonyms. There is no contradiction
in this because the theory of substance and the theory of synonyms are mutually
relative. Here, the intention is that although the living substance is said to
be finite and infinite due to the theory of synonyms, yet the pure conviction is
that only the substance which is eternal, infinite, marked by the single nature
of the knower, free from change, and eternally blissful, is worthy of
acceptance.  **Time Explanation**  **Verse 55**  This is the explanation of the
condition, cause, and arising of the existence and non-existence of the living
being.  **Neriya**  The names of the animals, humans, and gods are just
designations. They are doing the existence and non-existence of the state of
being.

The five astikayas, beginning with the naraka, are the 173 categories of beings,
including the tiryancha, manushya, and deva, which are named and categorized.
They cause the destruction of the sat (true) and the creation of the asat
(false). Just as the ocean, being the ocean, does not experience the creation of
the asat or the destruction of the sat, but the waves, carried and purified by
the wind from the four directions, cause the creation of the asat and the
destruction of the sat, so too, the jiva, being the jiva, does not experience
the destruction of the sat or the creation of the asat, but the naraka,
tiryancha, manushya, and deva categories, which arise in succession, cause the
destruction of the sat and the creation of the asat.

Explanation of the Six Substances and the Five Astikāyas  The previous sutra had
stated that the arising and passing away of the modes (paryāyas) of the jīva is
due to the rise of the karmic name-determining (nāma) karma, such as that of the
infernal beings (nāraka), animals (tiryañca), humans (manuṣya), and celestial
beings (deva).   The general meaning (anvayārtha) is: (Nāraka, tiryañca,
manuṣya, devā iti) The natures (prakṛtis) of the karmic name-determining (nāma)
karma are the infernal beings, animals, humans, and celestial beings. (Sato
bhāvasya) They cause the (nāśaṃ) destruction of the existing mode and (asato
uppādaṃ) the origination of the non-existent mode.  The specific meaning
(viśeṣārtha) is: Just as the ocean is eternal in its substance, yet the waves in
it are constantly arising and subsiding, similarly, this jīva is eternally the
knower-seer by its intrinsic nature, yet due to the influx of karmic activities
that have been flowing from beginningless time, it is moved away from the
attainment of the pure, passionless self, and keeps taking birth in different
gatis (modes of existence) by abandoning one and taking up another, due to the
rise of karmic name-determining (nāma) karma. This is said with reference to the
transformation of modes (paryāyas). In reality, similar or dissimilar modes are
always present in the substance (dravya) eternally, as it has been said.  That
is, the modes (paryāyas) of the eternal substance (dravya) keep manifesting and
perishing at every moment, just as the waves keep rising and subsiding in the
ocean. The purport here is that the pure, passionless, blissful consciousness
alone is the true jīvāstikāya (the substance of the living being) worthy of
being grasped.  Thus, the first part of the introductory explanation of the
three aspects - agency (kartṛtva), etc. - has been completed in three verses.
Verse 56 - This is the description of the arising of the qualities of the jīva:
The jīva's qualities are associated with both (ubhayoḥ) the rise (udayena) and
the subsidence (uvasamena) as well as the destruction (khayena) [of karmic
matter]. They are manifold (bahūsu) and extensive (vitthinṇā) in various
(atthesu) contexts.

The five **Jiva** qualities, beginning with **Audayika** (arising), are combined
with **Upayashamika** (subsided), **Kshayopayashamika** (subsided and
destroyed), **Kshayika** (destroyed), and **Parinaamika** (transformed). These
qualities are manifested in many ways.   The **Audayika** quality arises from
the fruition of **karma**, the **Upayashamika** quality arises from the
cessation of **karma**, the **Kshayopayashamika** quality arises from the
destruction and cessation of **karma**, the **Kshayika** quality arises from the
complete destruction of **karma**, and the **Parinaamika** quality arises from
the transformation of the **Jiva**'s essence.  Four of these qualities are
dependent on the four types of **upaadhi** (limiting conditions), while one is
dependent on the **Jiva**'s inherent nature. These qualities are manifested in
many ways due to the different types of **upaadhi** and the different natures of
the **Jiva**.

Although the description of the six substances and five states of being is, in
terms of its essence, the nature of the pure, knowing, and living being, it is
still considered to be generated by karma due to its arising from the
destruction of karma. It is a pure consequence, and it is completely independent
of direct karma. Here, the explanation is that the mixed, pacifying, and
destructive states are the causes of liberation. The arising state, along with
delusion, is the cause of bondage. The pure consequence is neither the cause of
bondage nor liberation. This is the meaning. Thus, it is said: "The mixed,
pacifying, and destructive states, they bring about liberation. The arising
state brings about bondage, the consequential state is inactive." ||56||  Thus,
in the second inner space, one verse-sutra has been spoken, primarily about the
five states of being.  Hindi Meaning Commentary Verse 56:  Uttanika - Further,
in the introduction, the five states of being of the living being, which were
mentioned earlier, are explained.  Meaning with Anvaya: (Those qualities of the
living being) They are spread out in many forms (in the many truths) in the
famous scriptures of the living being. (In the arising states) those arising
from the arising, (in the pacifying states) those arising from the pacifying,
(in the destructive states) those arising from the destruction of karma, (in the
mixed states) those arising from the mixture of destruction and pacifying, and
(in the consequential states) those arising from the consequential states.
Special Meaning: Here, the commentator has taken the reading "bahusu dasatyasu
vitthina" and interpreted it as meaning that these five states have been
elaborated upon in many scriptures. Of these five states, the arising,
pacifying, and mixed states are dependent on karma. Although the destructive
state is only in the form of knowledge, etc., and it is the nature of the pure,
knowing, and living being by its very nature, it is still generated by the
destruction of karma. Therefore, this state is also dependent on karma. The pure
consequential state is independent of direct karma. Here, the meaning is that
this explanation should be understood as follows: the mixed, pacifying, and
destructive states are the causes of liberation, and the arising state, along
with delusion, is the cause of bondage. The pure consequential state is neither
the cause of bondage nor liberation. As it is said:  The three states, mixed,
etc., bring about liberation, the arising state brings about bondage, and the
consequential state is devoid of the action of bondage and liberation. ||56||
In this way, in the second inner space, one verse-sutra has been spoken,
primarily about the five states of being.

Jain Terms Preserved:  Panchastikaya Prabhrita Samaya Vyakhya Gatha 57 - This is
a statement about the mode of agency (kartritva-prakarokti) of the Jiva's
(soul's) origination-related (audayika-adi) states.  Kammam vedayamano jivo
bhavam karedi yadrisam. So tassa tena katta havadi iti ya sasane pathitam.
||57||  The Jiva, while experiencing the karma, performs the state (bhava) of
that nature. He becomes the doer (karta) of that state in that manner, as is
stated in the scripture.  The Jiva experiences the karmic matter (dravya-karma)
through the empirical point of view (vyavahara-naya). That which is being
experienced is only the occasion (nimitta-matra) for the Jiva's states. On that
occasion, which is merely the occasion, the state that is the Jiva's own karma
is performed by the Jiva who has become the doer. Therefore, the Jiva is the
doer of that state in the manner in which the state is performed by the Jiva in
living.

## Translation:  178.  Explaining the six substances and five astikayas, the
karma-kanda, which is the action of mind, speech, and body, has resulted in the
accumulation of knowledge-obscuring karma and other karmas in the past. The one
who experiences this karma, which has arisen, through action, is the jiva. Who
is the doer? The jiva is the doer. He performs the action of the jiva, the
transformation of the jiva. He is the doer of that action. The jiva is the doer
of the karma-tapatra, the result of the transformation of raga, etc., through
the impure determination of the jiva, which is the cause of that action. This is
the meaning of the statement in the scriptures, "The jiva is the doer." ||57||
The jiva is the doer and the experiencer, because he is not free from the
perception of raga, etc., which is born of karma, and the perception of his own
pure self. This is the main point of the explanation of the verse.  **Hindi
Meaning:**  Verse 57: Now, the third point is being discussed. In the first
verse of this section, it is said that the jiva is the doer of raga, etc. In the
second verse, it is said that the arisen karma performs the action of raga, etc.
Thus, there are two independent verses. Then, in the first verse, it is said
that if the arisen karma is the only doer of raga, etc., then the jiva would
become completely inactive. The second verse refutes this objection. Thus, the
verses are mainly about the previous objection and its solution. Then, in the
first verse, the statement of the scriptures is shown that the jiva is not the
doer of the pudgala karma. In the second verse, the relationship between the
jiva and karma is explained, and the six karakas are established. Thus, there
are two independent verses in the third section. In this way, there are six
verses in the third section, which mainly focus on the doership.  **Anvaya:**
(Karma) Karma, (vedayamanah) experiencing, (jivah) this jiva, (jarisayam) in the
way, (bhavam) the state, (karedi) performs, (sah) that jiva, (tena) because of
that, (tassah) of that state, (kartah) the doer, (havaditti yah) is, (sasane) in
the Jain scriptures, (padhidam) is explained!  **Special Meaning:**  The soul,
which is free from attachment and full of supreme bliss, and which delights in
the vast and unbroken knowledge-kanda, does not experience its own nature.
Instead, it engages in the action of mind, speech, and body, which is the karma-
kanda. As a result, the jiva has accumulated knowledge-obscuring karma and other
karmas in the past. When these karmas arise, the jiva experiences them and
performs actions like raga, etc. Because of this impure determination, the jiva
becomes the doer of that impure state. This is stated in the scriptures. ||57||

##  Translation:  **Verse 58**  **Original Text:**  कम्मेण विणा उदयं जीवस्स ण
विज्जदे उवसमं वा । खइयं खओव-समियं तम्हा भावं तु कम्म-कदं ।। ५८।। कर्मणा विनोदयो
जीवस्य न विद्यते उपशमो वा। क्षायिकः क्षायोपशमिकस्तस्माद्भावस्तु कर्मकृतः ।।५८।।
**English Translation:**  Without karma, there is no rise (udaya) for the soul,
nor is there any cessation (upasama).  Neither is there any decay (kshaya) or
cessation of decay (kshayopasama). Therefore, the four states of the soul
(kshayika, kshayopashamika, audayika, and aupashamika) are all created by karma.
**Commentary:**  This verse explains that karma is the sole cause of the four
states of the soul: rise, cessation, decay, and cessation of decay.  The verse
states that without karma, these states would not exist. Therefore, the soul's
existence in these states is attributed to karma.  **Further Explanation:**  The
commentary explains that the soul's inherent nature (parinama) is eternal and
unchanging. However, the soul's temporary states (kshayika, kshayopashamika,
audayika, and aupashamika) are caused by karma. These states are temporary
because they arise and cease due to the influence of karma.  **Conclusion:**
This verse emphasizes the crucial role of karma in shaping the soul's existence
and its temporary states. It highlights that the soul's true nature is eternal
and unchanging, but its experiences are influenced by karma.

## Chapter 180: Description of the Five Astikayas of the Shadva-vyaya  This
description of the five Astikayas of the Shadva-vyaya is natural. The Kshayika
state, although it is inherent (manifest) in nature, is said to be Karma-krita
because it is finite and arises due to the destruction of Karma. The Aupashmika
state is also Karma-krita because it arises due to the subsidence of Karma and
is destroyed by its non-subsidence.  Alternatively, the four states of Udya,
Upashma, Kshaya, and Kshayo-pashma are the states of Dravya-karma. They are not
the states of a Jiva with a single state. Therefore, Dravya-karma, which is the
state of the soul arising from the Udyaika, is only instrumental in the burden
of the soul. Because it is itself transformed, Dravya-karma also acquires the
agency of the soul's states in the practical sense. ||58||

## 3 **Pancastikaya Prabhrut** 181 [Khaovsamyam] Kshayopaśamik bhava [na
vijjhade] does not occur [tamha] because [bhavam tu kampakadham] all these
bhavas are karma-krit.  **Special Meaning:**  Pure knowledge, darshan,
lakshanadhari, and bhavakarma, dravyakarma, and nokarma are distinct from the
supreme soul.  The audayik bhavas, which are obtained in the form of
dravyakarma, cannot occur in the jiva without the parinam of raga, etc.  Not
only audayik, but also aupashamik bhava cannot occur without the upasham of
dravyakarma.  Similarly, kshayopaśamik bhava cannot occur without the
kshayopaśam of dravyakarma, and kshayik bhava cannot occur without the kshaya of
dravyakarma.  Therefore, all these bhavas are karma-krit.  Because, excluding
pure parinamik bhavas, as mentioned earlier, the four bhavas - audayik,
aupashamik, kshayopaśamik, and kshayik - cannot occur without dravyakarma.
Therefore, it is known that these four bhavas, audayik, etc., are karma-krit due
to the unrefined, asadbhuta vyavahar nay.  Here, the implication is that in this
sutra, the kshayik bhava, which is the form of the attainment of the new,
kshayik, like kevalgyan, etc., and especially the nir-akulata lakshan, nischya
sukha, which is inherent in kevalgyan, is the basis of infinite qualities.  This
is the **1. kshayik bhava**, which is worthy of being grasped in all ways.  One
should believe and know this through the mind, and by abandoning mithyatva and
raga, etc., vikalpa-jnal, one should continuously meditate on this kshayik
bhava.  In this way, the main point of this explanation is that these four
bhavas are karma-krit due to the unrefined, asadbhuta vyavahar nay.  In the
previous gatha, it was said that the jiva is the doer of raga, etc., bhavas due
to the asuddha nischya nay.  Here, it is explained that karma is the doer of
these bhavas due to vyavahar.  In this way, two independent gathas have been
spoken.  **Samaya Vyakhya Gatha 59** Jiva-bhavasya karma-kartṛtve
pūrvapakṣo'yam. Bhavō jadi kamma-kado attā kammas sa hodi kidha kattā. Na kuṇadi
attā kiñci vi muttā aṇṇam saga bhavam. || 59 || Bhavō yadi karma-kṛta ātmā
karmaṇo bhavati katham kartā. Na karotyātmā kiñcidapi muktvānyat svakam bhavam.
|| 59 ||  If, indeed, the jiva's bhava, in the form of audayik, etc., is done by
karma, then the jiva is not the doer of it.

## Chapter 182: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  **Verse
59:**  It is said that the six substances and five astikayas are described. It
is not desirable that the jiva (living being) be considered inactive. Therefore,
by the process of elimination, the jiva becomes the doer of dravyakarma (action
of the substance). But how is this possible? Because, with certainty, the soul,
abandoning its own nature, does not do anything else.  **Commentary:**  This is
a preliminary objection (doubt) regarding the jiva being the doer of its own
nature. If the jiva's nature, like being born, is created by karma, then the
jiva is not the doer of its own nature. This is proven, and the inactivity of
the jiva is not acceptable. Therefore, the remaining possibility is that the
jiva must be the doer of dravyakarma. But how is this possible? Because, with
certainty, the soul, abandoning its own nature, does not do anything else.
**Translation of the Sanskrit Commentary:**  The commentary then presents two
interpretations of the verse. The first interpretation states that the verse
presents a preliminary objection, arguing that if the jiva is not the doer of
karma, then it would lead to the undesirable consequence of the jiva being
inactive. The second interpretation argues that the verse actually presents a
refutation of the preliminary objection, stating that the jiva is indeed the
doer of karma, and that this is not a flaw but rather a necessary consequence of
the jiva's nature.  The commentary then goes on to discuss the implications of
the jiva being the doer of karma, and how this relates to the concept of
liberation. It concludes by stating that the verse is a complex one, with
multiple layers of meaning.

**Verse 60**  **General Meaning:** (If) if (भावो) the state of mind (कम्मकदो) is
caused by karma, then (किध) how (अत्ता) the soul (कम्मस्य कत्ता होदि) becomes
the doer of karma? Because, if we take the state of mind as solely caused by
karma, then the soul cannot become the doer of karma without the state of mind,
because (अत्ता) this soul (सगं भावं) leaves its own state of mind (मुक्ता) and
(अण्णं किंचि वि) does not do anything else, like karma, etc.  **Specific
Meaning:** If the soul is considered to be completely free from the state of
mind, then there is a refutation of this in the next verse. This is one
interpretation. Another interpretation is that the refutation is in this verse
itself, and the solution is in the next verse, which only states the limitations
of the object. How is this said? If, as stated earlier, karma is the doer of the
state of mind, then the soul cannot be the doer of karma like punya, papa, etc.
In response to this objection, the disciple, following the Sankhya philosophy,
says that our view is that this soul is not the doer of karma, it is without
qualities, pure, eternal, omnipresent, inactive, formless, conscious, and only
the experiencer. This is the view of Kapila. According to our view, the soul
being the non-doer of karma is an ornament, not a defect. This is refuted by
saying that just as the soul is not the doer of the state of mind with pure
conviction, if this soul is also not the doer with impure conviction, then there
will be no bondage of its substance. Without the bondage of karma, there will be
no world, then it will be completely liberated, but this is contrary to direct
experience. This is the meaning.  **Explanation of the Verse:**  This verse
states that the state of mind is caused by karma, and karma is also caused by
the state of mind. However, the soul is not the doer of either karma or the
state of mind. They are not created by each other. The soul is the doer of its
own transformations, and karma is the doer of its own transformations.

## 184.  **Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas**  **Hindi
Commentary Verse 60 Anvayaartha (Meaning; Karma is the cause of the state of
being)**  The state of being is caused by karma (again) and (karma is the cause
of the state of being) the state of being is the cause of karma, (but they are
not the doers of each other) but in reality, they are not the doers of each
other, (nor are they without a doer) but they are not without a doer either.
**Commentary:** This, in the previous sutra (verse 59), is the principle that
resolves the previous objection.  Due to the fact that they are only causes,
karma is the doer of the state of being (the doer of the state of being like the
state of being of the audayika, etc. is the karma of the substance), the state
of being is also the doer of karma, but in reality, neither karma is the doer of
the state of being nor is the state of being the doer of karma. They (the state
of being and the karma of the substance) are not without a doer either, because
in reality, the jiva is the doer of the jiva's transformations and karma
(pudgala) is the doer of the karma's transformations. ||60||  ... **Sanskrit
Meaning Commentary Verse 60**  Now, in the previous sutra, the previous
objection was raised, saying that the self is not the doer of karma. This verse
gives a refutation of that objection. In the second explanation, it shows the
established view. The state of being is the pure jiva astikaya, which is the
opposite of the state of being, which is the result of false attachment, etc.
What is it characterized by? Karma is the cause - the karma that arises from the
pure self-nature, which is characterized by the mere wonder of consciousness,
without the rise of karma, is the cause of that which is the opposite of it.
What is karma? Karma is the karma of the substance, which is different from the
pure self-essence, without the karma of knowledge-obstruction, etc. Again, what
is it like? The state of being is the cause - the state of being that is the
opposite of the pure self-realization, which is without transformation, is the
cause of that which is the cause of the state of being. Not - not again, of them
- of the two, the state of being of attachment, etc. in the jiva and the karma
of the substance. What is not? The doer - the mutual dependence of the doer,
clearly, not without - not without. They are born - they are born, but again,
the substance and karma are. Without whom? Without the doer, the dependent doer,
but the state of being of attachment, etc. in the jiva is the dependent doer of
the jiva, and the karma of the substance is the karma of the pudgala, which is
not fit for the category of karma. In the second explanation, although the jiva
is not the doer in the pure sense, but when considered in the impure sense, it
is the doer, this is the meaning. ||60||  Thus, in the previous verse, in the
first explanation, there was the previous objection and then the answer to it,
so those two verses have passed.  **Hindi Meaning Commentary Verse 60
Utyanika:**  Further, in the previous sutra, the previous objection was raised,
saying that the self is not the doer of karma. This verse refutes that
objection. From the second explanation, it shows the limits of the object.
**Anvaya with General Meaning:** (The state of being) the state of being of
attachment, etc. (karma is the cause) is caused by karma.

**Pancastikaya Prabhrut** 185 It is said (Pune) and (Bhavacaranam) due to the
emotions like anger etc. (Kampam) the bondage of dravya karma (Havdi) happens
(Tesim) of those dravya and bhavacarmas (Khalu) with certainty (Katta Na Du)
there is no mutual upadan karta-pana (Du) but (Kattaram Vina) without the upadan
karta (Pan Bhuda) they have not happened. **Special Meaning:** The pure,
conscious, luminous, inherent nature of the pure jiva-stikaya, the opposite
emotions, which are mithyatva and raga etc. are the results, are free from the
rise of karmas, the mere wonder of consciousness, which is the nature of the
Paramatma, is opposite to the karmas that are obtained in the rise, and are the
cause of them, and the pure atma-tattva, which is free from the karmas like
jnana-avaran etc., is different from the new dravya-karma, which is bound by the
emotions like raga etc., which are opposite to the experience of the pure,
unchanging soul. Even though this is the case, there is no mutual upadan karta-
pana of the emotions like raga etc. related to the jiva and the dravya-karmas,
but both the emotions like raga etc. and the dravya-karmas have not happened
without the upadan karana, but the upadan karta of the emotions like raga etc.
related to the jiva is the jiva itself, and the upadan karta of the dravya-
karmas is the pudgala, which is worthy of karma-varna. In another explanation,
the meaning is that although the jiva is not the karta of the emotions like raga
etc. when considered with pure certainty, it is proven that the jiva is the
karta of the emotions like raga etc. with impure certainty. 160 || In this way,
the previous verse had presented the previous side through the first
explanation, here the answer to it is given, in this way two verses are said.

##  Verse 61: Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  Here, the
Agama shows that the soul is the doer of its own emotions, and the pudgala karma
is not the doer.  **Sanskrit Commentary:**  Verse 61 further strengthens this
explanation with the Agama's statement: "The soul, being the doer, does its own
nature, which is the form of consciousness." Although pure emotions like
omniscience are considered the soul's nature in pure knowledge, in the context
of karma being the doer, impure emotions like attachment are also considered the
soul's nature. The soul is the doer of its own emotions. However, the pudgala
karma is not the doer, according to the Jina's words. This is what should be
understood.  Although the doership of impure emotions is established here, they
are to be abandoned, and the opposite, pure emotions like infinite bliss, are to
be adopted. This is the meaning.  **Hindi Commentary:**  Verse 61: The
explanation is further strengthened by the Agama's statement.  Meaning with
Anvaya: The soul, being the doer of its own nature, is the doer of its own
emotions. The pudgala karma is not the doer. This is the Jina's word, which
should be understood.  Special Meaning: Although pure emotions like omniscience
are considered the soul's nature in pure knowledge, in the context of karma
being the doer, impure emotions like attachment are also considered the soul's
nature. The soul is the doer of these impure emotions in the context of impure
knowledge. However, the soul cannot be considered the doer of the pudgala karma.
This is the Agama of the Jina. The implication here is that although the soul is
established as the doer of impure emotions, these impure emotions are to be
abandoned, and the opposite, pure emotions like infinite bliss, are to be
adopted.  This is how the verse is explained through the Agama's statement.

## 187 **Panchaastikaya Prabhrit** **Samaya Vyakhya 62**  Here, due to the
inseparability of the factors, the self-nature of the karma and the jiva as the
doer is stated. Karma also does its own by its own nature, and the jiva also
does so by the nature of karma. ||62||  Karma also does its own by its own
nature, and the jiva also does so by the nature of karma. ||6||  Karma, indeed,
by being in the form of a pudgala-skandha, which is active in the form of karma,
assumes the role of the doer. It considers itself as karma by the power of
attaining karma, which is in the form of the instrument. Even after the
destruction of the previous state, it attains the role of the object due to its
dependence on the permanent. It attains the role of the recipient due to being
embraced by the karma, which is in the form of the arising result. It attains
the role of the locus due to being the basis of the result being held. It stands
on its own as a six-factor entity and does not depend on any other factor.
Similarly, the jiva, by being active in the form of the soul-substance, which is
in the form of a state, assumes the role of the doer. It considers itself as the
instrument by the power of attaining the state, which is in the form of the
instrument. It considers itself as karma by the state attained, which is in the
form of karma. Even after the destruction of the previous state, it attains the
role of the object due to its dependence on the permanent. It attains the role
of the recipient due to being embraced by the karma, which is in the form of the
arising state. It attains the role of the locus due to being the basis of the
state being held. It stands on its own as a six-factor entity and does not
depend on any other factor.  Therefore, there is no jiva as the doer of karma,
and there is no karma as the doer of the jiva, due to the certainty of the
factors. ||62||  **Hindi Samaya Vyakhya Gatha 62**  Anvayaarth - (Karma api)
Karma also (sven svabhaavena) by its own nature (svakam karoti) does its own
(cha) and (taadrushak jiva api) such a jiva also (karmasvabhaavena bhaavana) by
the nature of karma (audyaikad adi bhaavase) (smayak aatmaanam) does its own as
it truly is.  _Teeka_ - Due to the inseparability of the factors, karma and jiva
are the doers of their own nature.  Karma, in reality, (1) assumes the role of
the doer by being in the form of a pudgala-skandha, which is active in the form
of karma. (2) It considers itself as karma by the power of attaining karma,
which is in the form of the instrument. (3) It experiences karma by the karma-
result attained, which is in the form of karma. (4) Even after the destruction
of the previous state, it attains the role of the object due to its dependence
on the permanent. (5) It attains the role of the recipient due to being embraced
by the karma, which is in the form of the arising result (i.e., the arising
result-work is given to it). (6) It attains the role of the locus due to being
the basis of the result being held.

188 The six-fold category of substance, which has taken on the role of the
locus, does not depend on any other factor, but exists in its own right as a
six-fold category. In the same way, the soul, (1) by virtue of its inherent
nature as the soul-substance, takes on the role of the agent, (2) by virtue of
its power to acquire qualities, takes on the role of the instrument, (3) by
virtue of the qualities it acquires, experiences the role of the object, (4) by
virtue of its steadfastness even when its previous qualities are destroyed,
takes on the role of the separation, (5) by virtue of being the recipient of the
qualities that arise (i.e., by virtue of the qualities that arise being given to
it), takes on the role of the beneficiary, and (6) by virtue of being the basis
of the qualities it possesses, takes on the role of the location - it exists in
its own right as a six-fold category, without depending on any other factor.
Therefore, it is certain that the soul is not the agent of the karma, and the
karma is not the agent of the soul. ||62||

## Pancastikaya Prabhrut  **General Meaning with Anvaya:** (Karma) Karma also
(with its own nature) (itself) its own material karma (well) does (in the same
way) this Jiva also (with the nature of karma) does its own emotions in the form
of karma.  **Specific Meaning:** The commentator explains by applying the six
karakas of agent, action, etc., that this karmic pudgala, being the agent,
obtains the karaka of the agent, and with the help of its own material karma,
which is the instrument, it does its own karma pudgala for the state of the
karma pudgala, from the karma pudgalas, in the basis of the karma pudgala
itself. In this way, this pudgala, by undergoing transformation through its own
inseparable six karakas, changes its state. It does not need the karaka of
another substance. In the same way, the Jiva, being the agent itself, obtains
its own emotional state, and with its own soul as the cause, it does its own
soul for its own soul, from its own soul, in the basis of its own soul. That is,
the soul, by undergoing transformation through its own inseparable six karakas,
does its own emotions. It does not need any other karaka. Here, the implication
is that just as the soul, undergoing transformation through the six impure
karakas, does its own impure emotional state, so this pure soul, through the
inseparable six karakas of its own right faith, its own right knowledge, and its
own right conduct, undergoes transformation and does its own pure emotional
state. || 6 ||  In this way, two verses are complete, independent of each other,
according to the statement of the Agamas and the inseparable six karakas. In
this way, the third inner space is complete through six verses from the
community.  **Time Explanation Verse 63:** Karma does karma, if that soul does
itself. How does it enjoy its fruit? The soul gives the fruit of karma. || 63 ||
Karma karma karoti yadi sa atma karoty atmanam. Katham tasya phalam bhunakti
atma karma ca dadati phalam. || 63 ||

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  **Hindi Commentary
Verse 63**  **Anvayaartha** - (If) if (karma) karma (karma karoti) does karma
and (sa: atma) the soul (atmanam karoti) does to the soul then (karma) karma
(phalm katham dadati) why does it give fruit to the soul (na! and (atma! aga.
tasya palam bhutate) why will it enjoy its fruit?  **Tika** - If karma and the
jiva are mutually non-doers, then there will be a situation of "the fruit given
by another is enjoyed by another", this defect is pointed out here and the
previous side is presented. ||63||  **Sanskrit Tatparya Vritti Verse 63**  Now,
after explaining the six karakas in the manner of the previous side, this
explanation is done with certainty. Not knowing the Nayavichar, the student
takes the one-sided view and presents the previous side: "If karma, karma, the
doer, does karma, if, in one way, the soul does karma without dependence on the
soul's transformation, if that soul does to itself, and not to the substance
karma, then how will it enjoy the fruit of that undone karma? Who is it? The
soul is the doer, and karma gives the fruit. How can the soul give the fruit to
itself, which is not done by the jiva? It is not possible." ||63||  The verse is
concluded with the previous side through the fourth position.  **Hindi Tatparya
Vritti Verse 63**  **Uththānika** - Further, while explaining the six karakas in
the manner mentioned earlier, this explanation is done with certainty. Hearing
this, the student, not knowing the Nayavichar, takes the one-sided view and
presents the previous side.  **Anvaya with General Meaning** - (Jadi) If (karma)
substance karma (karma) substance karma does (kuvdi) in one way without
dependence on the soul's transformation and (so appa) that soul (appaanm) does
to itself - does not do substance karma, then (kidh) how (appa) the soul (tass
phalm) enjoys the fruit of that undone karma (cha) and (karma) that undone karma
by the jiva (phalm cha dedi) how does it give fruit to the soul.  **Samaya
Vyakhya Verse 64**  **Atha Siddhanta Sutraani**  **Ogaadh-gaadh-nicido poggal-
kayeihi savvado logo. Suhamehi badarehi ya namta-namteihi vividheihi.** ||64||
**Translation:**  **Ogaadh-gaadh-nicido poggal-kayeihi savvado logo. Suhamehi
badarehi ya namta-namteihi vividheihi.** ||64||  **Meaning:** All beings are
bound by the **Ogaadh-gaadh-nicido poggal-kayeihi** (the five astikayas:
**Ogaadh**, **Gaadh**, **Nicido**, **Poggal**, and **Kayeihi**). They are also
bound by various **Suhamehi badarehi ya namta-namteihi** (pleasures, pains, and
the states of being limited and unlimited).

The entire world is filled with subtle and gross **puḍgala** particles, densely
packed together.  ॥६४।। It has been said that **karma-yogya puḍgalas** are
present everywhere in the world, like the particles of collyrium in a box, and
therefore they are present wherever the soul is, without being brought there.

## Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  This section primarily
focuses on the "Ogaḍhagaḍha" and other verses, which explain the concepts of
"Upādāna-Kartāpana" (the agent of creation) and "Bhoktāpana" (the experiencer).
There are three verses in this section. Then, there are two verses that explain
"Kāpana" (the creator) and "Bhoktāpana" (the experiencer) in a concise manner,
starting with the verse "Jīva Poggalakāya". Following these, there are two
verses, starting with "Evam Kattā Bhottā", which explain "Bandhaka-Svāmīpana"
(the owner of bondage) and "Mokṣa-Svāmīpana" (the owner of liberation). In
total, there are seven verses in this section, which address the opposing
arguments before presenting the main point.  The first verse states that just as
this world is filled with subtle beings (who are pure and possess infinite
qualities like omniscience), it is also filled with Pudgalas.  **General Meaning
with Anvaya:** (Loko) This world (Sambado) is completely filled (Suhamehi) with
subtle (Vādarhiṁ Ya) and gross (Vivihehi) diverse (Tāṇatehiṁ) infinite
(Poggalakāyehiṁ) Pudgala skandhas (Ogaḍha Gaḍha Ničito).  **Specific Meaning:**
Just as this world is filled with five types of subtle stationary beings like
the Earth-body, without any gaps, like a container filled with ink, similarly,
this world is filled with countless, diverse, infinite Pudgala skandhas in all
its countless regions. The Pudgala skandhas that are worthy of being categorized
in this section are also present where the soul is. They are present there
without being brought from elsewhere. Further categorizations will be discussed
later in the section on bondage. The implication here is that although these
categories are densely packed like water where the soul is, they are still
worthy of being abandoned. The pure, single-natured, supreme soul, distinct from
them, is the only one worthy of being embraced.  **Verse 64**  **Verse 65:**
This verse explains the types of karma that arise from the actions of the soul.
**Anvaya:** Attā Kuṇadi Sabhāvam Taththa Gadā Poggalā Sabhāvehi. Gacchaṁti
Kammabhāvam Aṇṇoṇṇāva-Gāha-Mavagāḍhā.  **Translation:** The soul creates its own
nature, and the Pudgalas, with their own natures, enter into that nature. They
become karma-nature, deeply intertwined with each other.  **Explanation:** The
soul, in its state of samsara, never abandons its inherent nature of Pariṇāmic
Chaitanya (transformative consciousness). Due to its eternal bondage to the
Gandha (odor), it is eternally bound by the defilements of Moha (delusion), Raga
(attachment), and Dvesha (aversion). It is through these defilements that the
soul experiences various states of being. Whenever the soul experiences a state
of delusion, attachment, or aversion, it creates a cause for karma. The
Pudgalas, with their own natures, enter into the soul's region, intermingling
with each other, and become karma-nature.

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):  The Pañcāstikāya Prābhṛta Hindi
Commentary Gāthā 65  Anvayārtha - The ātmā (soul) performs (karoti) its own
(svabhāva) nature (mōharaigadvēṣarūpa) in the form of delusion, attachment and
aversion. Then, the pudgalas (matter aggregates) residing there (tatra gatāḥ),
through their own (svabhāvaiḥ) nature, enter (viśiṣṭa prakārēṇa) the ātmā in a
distinct manner, and attain (gacchanti) the bhāva of karma.  Ṭīkā - This verse
describes how karma arises without being caused by others. The ātmā in the
saṃsāra state, without abandoning its essential nature of cognitive
consciousness, is bound by beginningless bondage and is permeated by the impure
dispositions of beginningless delusion, attachment and aversion. Wherever and
whenever the ātmā in the saṃsāra state performs (parinṇamati) its own
dispositions in the form of delusion, attachment or aversion, there and at that
time, the pudgalas, taking those dispositions as the instrumental cause, enter
the ātmā's regions in a distinct manner through their own dispositions and
attain the bhāva of karma.  Sanskrit Tātparyavṛtti Gāthā 65 When the ātmā has
the impure dispositions of mithyātva (false belief), rāga (attachment) etc., the
pudgala aggregates suitable for karma, certainly through their own upādāna
(internal cause), transform into the form of karma.

---------------------------
The six substances, with their five categories, are described as being deeply
and intensely (avagaḍhā) bound to karma (kammabhāvam). They become (gacchanti)
the state of karma (dravya karma).  **Special Note:** The pure, unstained,
luminous consciousness, free from attachment, aversion, and delusion, is called
the natural state of the soul (ātmaka). Why is the state of attachment,
aversion, etc. called the natural state? Answer: Due to the influence of the
bondage (bandhaprakaraṇa), the state of attachment, aversion, etc. is called the
natural state, in comparison to the impure consciousness. There is no fault in
this. Here it is said that when this impure soul undergoes its state of
attachment, aversion, and delusion, then the karmic particles (pudgala skandha)
that are fit for karmic bondage, which are situated in the field of the body
that is restrained by the soul, become the state of karma (dravya karma) due to
their own inherent power (upādāna kāraṇarūpa śakti). And they become bound to
the soul in the regions (pradeśa) in the same way that milk and water mix
together. ||65||  **Time Commentary Verse 66:** The unique nature of karma is
described here. Just as the pudgala substances are arranged into skandhas in
many ways, so too know that karma is diverse, not created by others. ||66||
**Hindi Time Commentary Verse 66:** **Anvaya-artha:** (Yathā) Just as
(pudgaladravyaṇām) the pudgala substances (bahuprakāraih) in many ways
(skandhanirvṛttiḥ) are arranged into skandhas (paraiḥ akṛtā) without being done
by others (dṛṣṭā) are seen, (tathā) in the same way (karmaṇām) the diversity of
karma (vijānihi) know that it is not created by others.  **Commentary:** The
diversity of karma (bahuprakāratā) is not done by others, it is said here. Just
as when one experiences the light of the moon and sun, the evening clouds, the
rainbow, and many other things, the pudgala skandha is formed without any
dependence on debt, so too karma is formed without any dependence on debt, in
many ways, due to the experience of the soul's state (jīvapariṇāmopa-lambhe),
such as the covering of knowledge (jñānāvaraṇa), etc. ||66||

**Sahavy-Pancastimapan -** In this way, there is the notion of the self as the
creator in the pudgala, this is mainly stated in three gathas.  **Time
Explanation Gatha 67**  It is said here that even though there is the single
agency of the jiva and karma, in practice, the jiva does not contradict the
experience of the fruits given by karma.  **Jivas are bound to pudgala-bodies by
mutual deep grasping and attachment.** When they are separated in time, they
give and experience happiness and sorrow.  **Jivas, due to their attachment to
moha, raga, and dvesha, and pudgala-skandhas due to their inherent nature of
being sticky, remain bound in the state of bondage, like a pair of atoms, by
mutual deep grasping and attachment.** When they are separated from each other,
then, due to the arising and passing away of the pudgala-body, they give
happiness and sorrow as a result of their inherent nature, and in practice, they
are merely the cause of the desired and undesired objects. The jivas, in
practice, experience the fruits of the desired and undesired objects, which are
obtained by the arising of the pudgala-karma, which are merely the cause of the
happiness and sorrow that are the result of their inherent nature. Thus, the
quality of the jiva as the experiencer is also explained.  **Hindi Time
Explanation Gatha 67**  **Anvayaartha:** [Jivas are pudgala-bodies] The jiva and
the pudgala-body [are mutually bound by deep grasping and attachment] [in a
specific way] by mutual deep grasping, [mutually] bound, (when they are
separated in time) when separated by time (they give and experience happiness
and sorrow) they give and experience happiness and sorrow [i.e., the pudgala-
body gives happiness and sorrow, and the jiva experiences it].  **Commentary:**
It is said here that even though there is the single agency of the jiva and
karma (only their own nature), in practice, the jiva does not contradict the
experience of the fruits given by karma.  The jiva, due to its attachment to

- The **Pancastikaya** (five-fold body) beings, from the **Udayase** (arising)
of the **Dravyakarma** (matter-karma), experience the **Iṣṭāniṣṭa** (desirable
and undesirable) objects, as per their **Vyavahara** (practical experience), and
experience the fruits of **Sukha** (happiness) and **Duḥkha** (suffering) in
that way. Thus, the **Bhoktṛtva** (experiencer) quality of the **Jiva** (soul)
has also been explained. ||67||  **Sanskrit Commentary:**  Verse 67: The
previous argument was made that how does the Jiva experience the fruits of
**Akṛtakarma** (unperformed actions). There, the **Naya** (principle) division
is used to show the logic regarding the **Phalabhoktṛtva** (fruit-experiencer)
aspect. The Jivas are **Poggalakāya** (body of matter) and **Jīvakāya** (body of
soul) and **Pudgalakāya** (body of matter). How are they?
**Aṇṇoṇṇāgāḍhagahaṇapaḍibaddhā** (mutually bound by strong grasping), they are
bound together by their own **Rāga** (attachment) etc. **Srigdharaūkṣa** (smooth
and rough) etc. **Pariṇāma** (transformations) due to their previous
**Anyonyāvagāha** (mutual penetration). They remain in this bound state. When
they **Vijujjāmāṇaudayakā** (arise and become manifest), they give their own
fruits and **Tinujārā** (leave their traces) and **Nirjaśa** (become inactive).
What do they do? The **Diti** (give) **Nirvikāra** (unchanging) **Cidānanda**
(bliss of consciousness) **Ekasvabhāva** (one nature) Jiva, due to
**Mithyātvārāga** (false attachment) etc., has **Mithyātvam** (falsehood) in the
form of **Ekatvaruci** (desire for oneness), **Mithyājnāna** (false knowledge)
in the form of **Ekatvapratipatti** (understanding oneness), and
**Mithyācāritra** (false conduct) in the form of **Ekatvapariṇati**
(transformation into oneness). Thus, the **Pudgalas** (matter) of the
**Mithyātvādi** (falsehood etc.) **Bayaparina** (transformed) Jivas are the
**Kartāra** (doers) and **Dadati** (give). What do they give? **Suhadukkha**
(happiness and suffering) - **Anākulata** (unperturbed)
**Lakṣaṇapāramārthikasukha** (true happiness) - **Vipirīta** (opposite)
**Paramākulata** (extreme perturbation) - **Utpādaka** (producing)
**Abhyantaranisaye** (in the inner determination) **Harṣaviṣāda** (joy and
sorrow) - **Vyavahāre** (in practical experience) **Punaḥ** (again)
**Bahirviṣaye** (in external objects) **Vivideṣṭāniṣṭendriyaviṣayaprapti**
(acquisition of various desirable and undesirable sense objects) -
**Kaṭukaviṣarasāsvādasvabhāva** (bitter and poisonous taste) -
**Sāṃsārikasukhaduḥkha** (worldly happiness and suffering) - **Bhujamti**
(experience) - **Vītarāga** (free from attachment) **Paramāhādaika** (supreme
bliss) **Rūpasukhamṛtarasāsvādabhojanarahitā** (devoid of the taste of the
nectar of supreme bliss) **Jīvā** (souls) **Niścaye** (in determination)
**Bhāvarūpa** (form of feeling) **Vyavahāreṇa** (in practical experience)
**Dravyarūpa** (form of matter) **Cha** (also) **Bhujamte** (experience)
**Sevanti** (enjoy) - this is the meaning. ||67||  Thus, the explanation of
**Bhoktṛtva** (experiencer) is primarily contained in this verse.  **Hindi
Commentary:**  Verse 67: The **Uthānika** (introduction) - the previous argument
made by the student was that how does the Jiva experience the fruits of
**Akṛtakarma** (unperformed actions). The answer to this is given through the
**Naya** (principle) division, showing that the Jiva experiences the fruits.
**Anvaya** (word order) with **Sāmānyārtha** (general meaning): (**Jīvā**) the
worldly Jivas and (**Puggalakāya**) the **Dravyakarma** (matter-karma) groups
(**Aṇṇoṇṇāgāḍhagahaṇapaḍibaddhā**) are mutually bound together in a strong way.
[**Kāle**] at the time of **Udayakāla** (arising) [**Vijujjāmāṇā**] the
**Pudgalas** (matter) become separated from the Jiva and [**Suhadukkha**] give
happiness and suffering in the form of **Sāta** (good) or **Asāta** (bad)
[**Diti**] give [**Bhujamti**] then the Jivas experience them.  **Viśeṣārtha**
(specific meaning): Due to their own **Rāga** (attachment) etc. **Pariṇāma**
(transformations) and the **Srigdharaūkṣa** (smooth and rough) qualities in the
**Padalas** (matter), the **Dravyakarma** (matter-karma) groups are already
bound to the **Pradeśas** (regions) of the Jivas. When they become complete in
their state and arise in **Udayakāla** (arising), they manifest their own fruits
and fall away. At that time, those **Karmas** (actions) give **Suhadukkha**
(happiness and suffering) to those Jivas, primarily those which are
**Anākulata** (unperturbed) - **Lakṣaṇapāramārthikasukha** (true happiness) -
**Vipirīta** (opposite) - **Paramākulata** (extreme perturbation) - **Utpādaka**
(producing).

##  Verse 198:  **Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas**  The
**Mithyadrishti** (false-sighted) view is that which considers the **Jiva**
(soul) to be one with the **Nirvikar** (unchanging), **Chidananda** (blissful
consciousness), **Ek-Swabhav** (one nature), and **Mithyatva** (falsehood),
**Raga** (attachment), and other **Bhavas** (emotions) as one. They are
**Mithyajnani** (false-knowers) who believe that the **Jiva** is inherently
**Raga** (attachment), **Dvesha** (aversion), **Moha** (delusion), etc. They are
**Mithyachari** (false-conduct) who engage in the **Parinamana**
(transformation) of **Raga** (attachment) and other **Bhavas** (emotions). Such
**Mithyadarshana** (false-view), **Mithyajnana** (false-knowledge), and
**Mithyacharita** (false-conduct) lead the **Jiva** to experience inner
**Ashuddha** (impure) **Nischya** (certainty) in the form of **Harsha** (joy) or
**Vishada** (sorrow). In their **Vyavahara** (practical life), they experience
external objects as **Ista** (desirable) or **Anishta** (undesirable) through
their senses, and they experience the taste of **Madhur** (sweet) or **Katuk**
(bitter) like the taste of poison, which manifests as worldly **Sukha**
(pleasure) or **Dukha** (pain). They do not experience the **Vitraaga**
(detachment), **Paramananda** (supreme bliss), **Sukhamrita** (nectar of
happiness), and **Rasaasvada** (taste of bliss). They experience their own
**Bhavas** (emotions) internally, and they experience objects externally. This
is the meaning to understand.  ## Verse 68:  **Timely Explanation**  This verse
explains the **Kartṛtva** (agency) and **Bhoktṛtva** (enjoyment).
**Translation:**  Therefore, **Karma** (action) is connected to the **Jiva**
(soul) as the **Karta** (agent) in the **Bhavas** (emotions). The **Jiva** is
the **Bhoktā** (enjoyer) of the **Karmaphala** (fruits of action) due to the
**Chetak** (consciousness) **Bhavas** (emotions).  **Explanation:**  Therefore,
**Karma** (action) is connected to the **Jiva** (soul) as the **Karta** (agent)
in the **Bhavas** (emotions). The **Jiva** is the **Bhoktā** (enjoyer) of the
**Karmaphala** (fruits of action) due to the **Chetak** (consciousness)
**Bhavas** (emotions).  **Conclusion:**  Thus, it is established that the
**Jiva** is the **Karta** (agent) of its own **Bhavas** (emotions) in
**Nischya** (certainty) and the **Karta** (agent) of the **Jiva** (soul) in
**Vyavahara** (practical life). The **Jiva** is also the **Karta** (agent) of
its own **Bhavas** (emotions) in **Nischya** (certainty) and the **Karta**
(agent) of **Karma** (action) in **Vyavahara** (practical life). Just as
**Karma** (action) is the **Karta** (agent) in both **Nischya** (certainty) and
**Vyavahara** (practical life), it is not the **Bhoktā** (enjoyer) in either.
Why? Because it lacks the **Chetanya** (consciousness) and **Anubhuti**
(experience) that are necessary for **Sadbhavas** (existence). Therefore, only
the **Jiva** (soul), due to its **Chetanatva** (consciousness), is the
**Bhoktā** (enjoyer) of the **Karmaphala** (fruits of action), which are the
**Sukha** (pleasure) and **Dukha** (pain) that arise from the **Jiva** (soul)
itself, and the **Ista** (desirable) and **Anishta** (undesirable) objects.
**Hindi Explanation:**  **Anvayarth:**  Therefore, **Karma** (action) is
connected to the **Jiva** (soul) as the **Karta** (agent) in the **Bhavas**
(emotions). The **Jiva** is the **Bhoktā** (enjoyer) of the **Karmaphala**
(fruits of action) due to the **Chetak** (consciousness) **Bhavas** (emotions).
**Explanation:**  Therefore, **Karma** (action) is connected to the **Jiva**

This commentary on the Panchaastikaya is a summary of the concepts of agency and
experience.   Therefore (from the previous statements), it is established that
karma is the agent of its own state by certainty, and the agent of the states of
the living being by convention. The living being is also the agent of its own
state by certainty, and the agent of karma by convention.  Just as karma is the
agent in both ways, it is not the experiencer in any way. Why? Because it does
not have the capacity for conscious experience. Therefore, due to its
consciousness, only the living being is known as the experiencer of the fruits
of karma - in some ways, the results of happiness and suffering in the soul, and
in some ways, the objects of desire and aversion. ||68||  **Sanskrit
Commentary:**  Verse 68: Now, the conclusion regarding agency and experience is
stated. Therefore, because there is no mutual dependence between the living
being and karma as stated earlier, karma is the agent of karma. Of what? By
certainty, of its own states, and by convention, of the states of the living
being like attachment, etc. The living being is also the agent of the states of
material karma by convention, and by certainty, of its own conscious state. How
does karma become the agent of its own states? It is combined with its states,
like the states of false perception, attachment, etc., and the living being is
combined with the state of karma. Therefore, the living being is the
experiencer. Who is the experiencer? The living being, devoid of the single
experience of pure consciousness and bliss. By what is it the experiencer? By
its impure conscious state, which is opposite to the supreme light of
consciousness. What does it experience? The fruits of karma, which are the
results of the pure and wise nature of the supreme soul, and which are the
natural experience of pure and supreme bliss. Therefore, the opposite of this is
the experience of worldly happiness and suffering, which is the fruit of good
and bad karma. ||68||  Thus, the previous verse focused primarily on the
experience of karma, while this verse focuses primarily on the conclusion
regarding the agency and experience of karma. These two verses together complete
the discussion.  **Hindi Commentary:**  Verse 68: The following verses summarize
the various statements about the agent and the experiencer.  General Meaning:
Therefore (tamha), material karma (kamma) is the agent of its own states
(bhaaveṇ sanjudo) by certainty (hī), and the agent of the states of the living
being (jīvasa) by convention (adha). Similarly, the living being is also the
agent of its own states of attachment, etc., due to the arising of material
karma (du). But, the living being (jīvo) alone, due to its impure conscious
state (chedagabhaaveṇ), becomes the experiencer (bhotta) of the fruits of karma
(kammaphala).  Specific Meaning: Because we have already stated that the living
being is not the material cause of material karma, and material karma is not the
material cause of the states of the living being, therefore, material karma is
the agent of its own states of knowledge-obscuration, etc., which are its
material causes. By convention, it is the agent of the states of attachment,
etc., of the living being.

200 The one who describes the six substances and five astikayas is also the doer
of his own conscious states. In practice, he is the doer of the karma-bond of
the substance. This pudgala substance, being associated with the false views,
attachment, etc., related to the jiva, is the doer of its karmic states.
Similarly, the jiva is also the doer of attachment, etc., due to the arising of
past karma. And this jiva, being alone, without any change, pure consciousness,
bliss, and single experience, experiences the opposite of its own supreme
consciousness, the impure conscious state, due to the pure knowledge, single
nature, and the feeling of the supreme soul principle. It experiences the
opposite of the natural, pure, supreme bliss, the fruit of the experience, in
the form of worldly happiness and sorrow, the fruit of good or bad karma. This
is the meaning. ||68||  In this way, the previous verse mainly spoke of the
being who experiences karma. Here, two verses are spoken mainly about the
contraction of the statement of both the doer and the experiencer of karma.
Time Explanation Verse 69 Karma-sammutam asukhena Shu gatat. Evam katta bhotta

||69||  Hindi Time Explanation Verse 69 Anvayarth (evam) in this way (svakai
karmabhih) by his own karma (karta bhotta bhavan) being the doer and experiencer
(atma) the soul (mohasanchannah) being covered by delusion (param aparam
sansaram) in the finite or infinite world (hindate) wanders.  Commentary - This
is an explanation of the dominant quality of the power of the soul due to its
association with karma.  In this way, due to the manifested power of the soul,
which has taken the authority of being the doer and experiencer through its own
karma, this soul, due to its being covered by the delusion of the beginningless,
has given rise to opposite attachment, and the light of right knowledge has been
extinguished, therefore, it wanders in the finite or infinite world. ||69||

**Verse 69**  **Sanskrit Commentary:**  The verse reiterates the previous
statement about the dominance of karma, emphasizing its primary role. It
explains that the soul, though not truly the doer or enjoyer of karma in
absolute terms, is considered so in conventional terms. This is due to the
soul's association with karma, as explained in the previous sections. The soul,
thus, becomes the doer and enjoyer. Who is this soul? It is the **ap-atma**
(individual soul). What are the causes of this? It is due to the **sangehi
kammehi** (karmas of its own, both auspicious and inauspicious). What does the
soul do, thus burdened? It **hindadi** (wanders, wanders, roams). Where does it
wander? In **samsara** (the cycle of birth and death), which is finite, unlike
the infinite samsara of the liberated soul. What is the specific nature of this
samsara? It is **param** (transcendable) for the **bhavya** (those destined for
liberation) and **aparam** (untranscendable) for the **abhavya** (those not
destined for liberation). What is the nature of the soul? It is
**mohasanchanno** (obscured by delusion), meaning that though it is free from
delusion in absolute terms, it is still considered to be veiled by delusion in
conventional terms. This is because it is still subject to
**darshanacharitramohasanchanna** (delusion in perception, conduct, and
knowledge).  **Hindi Commentary:**  The verse reiterates the dominance of karma,
as explained earlier.  **General Meaning with Anvaya:**  Just as we have said
before, this worldly soul, due to its own auspicious and inauspicious karmas,
becomes the doer, enjoyer, and experiencer. It is obscured by delusion and
wanders in the cycle of birth and death, which is transcendable for those
destined for liberation and untranscendable for those not destined for
liberation.  **Specific Meaning:**  Although the soul is not truly the doer or
enjoyer of karma in absolute terms, it is considered so in conventional terms.
This is because it is the doer and enjoyer of its own pure nature, and also
because it is the doer and enjoyer of its own auspicious and inauspicious karmas
in conventional terms. It wanders in this cycle of four births, which is finite
and different from the infinite samsara of the liberated soul. This soul is free
from delusion in absolute terms, but is still considered to be veiled by
delusion in conventional terms, as it is still subject to delusion in
perception, conduct, and knowledge.

##  Verse 202: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas
**Commentary:** This verse explains the quality of mastery (Prabhutva) through
the lens of being free from karma.  **Verse 70:**  The one who has attained the
path, as spoken by the Jinas, with their calmed and diminished delusion, The
wise one, who walks the path of knowledge and understanding, reaches the city of
liberation. ||7||  **Explanation:**  If this very soul, having attained the path
as instructed by the Jinas, with calmed and diminished delusion, having
eradicated the opposite attachment, with the light of right knowledge shining
forth, having ended the authority of being the doer and the enjoyer, and having
manifested the power of mastery through right knowledge, walks the path of
understanding, then they reach the city of liberation, which is the realization
of the pure soul essence. ||70||  **Hindi Commentary:**  Verse 70:
**Anvayaartha:** (Jinbhaasiten marg samupgatah) The one who has attained the
path through the words of the Jinas, (upashaant ksheen mohah) with calmed and
diminished delusion (meaning, the one whose delusion of perception has been
calmed, destroyed, or calmed and destroyed), (jnaan anumaarg chaari) walks the
path of knowledge and understanding (walks the path of following knowledge),
(dheerah) that wise person (nirvaan puran vrajati) attains the city of
liberation.  **Tika:** This is an explanation of the quality of mastery through
the principle of being free from karma.  When this very soul, having attained
the path as instructed by the Jinas, due to calmed and diminished delusion (due
to the calming, destruction, or calming and destruction of the delusion of
perception), with the opposite attachment eradicated, with the light of right
knowledge shining forth, having ended the authority of being the doer and the
enjoyer, and having manifested the power of mastery through right knowledge,
walks the path of understanding (conducts themselves), then they reach the city
of liberation (the city of liberation), which is the realization of the pure
soul essence. ||7||  **Sanskrit Commentary:**  Verse 70:  Here, the previously
mentioned mastery is again explained, with the principle of being free from
karma as the main point. Uvasant ksheen mohah means calmed and diminished
delusion; the term anopashama refers to the state of right conduct with no
calming, ksheena refers to the state of right conduct with diminished delusion,
and both together refer to the state of right conduct with calmed and diminished
delusion. The path of liberation is the path of certainty, conduct, and
liberation, which is threefold in nature: the jewel of distinction, the jewel of
non-distinction, and the jewel of both. Samupgatah means attained, by whom? By
Jinbhaasiden, the one who speaks the words of the Jinas, the one who is free
from attachment and all-knowing. Naan refers to the knowledge that is free from
modification and self-awareness, and abheden refers to the pure soul, which is
its foundation. Anu refers to the knowledge quality, which is considered as the
soul, by being considered as the soul.

The **Panchaastikaya** (five categories of existence) are described as follows:
**203** The **Magmachari** (one who follows the path of liberation) is described
as one who has attained certainty in **Nischya** (knowledge), **Vyavahar**
(conduct), and **Mokshamarg** (path of liberation). Such a **Bhavya** (evolving
soul) is like a **Punḍarīka** (lotus) with many virtues and **vajdi** (goes,
proceeds) towards **Nivvāṇapura** (city of liberation), which is characterized
by **atyāvāśa** (supreme bliss), **sukha** (happiness), and **anantpaṇā**
(infinite qualities), and is the realization of the **śuddhatmā** (pure soul).
What further distinguishes this **Bhavya**? They are **dhīra** (steadfast),
meaning they remain steadfast in their **Nischya Ratna Tray** (three jewels of
certainty) even during **ghāropaśarga** (severe trials), like the **Pāṇḍavas**
(heroes of the Mahabharata).  This is the explanation of **karma-rahittva**
(being free from karma) in the second **gāthā** (verse).  Similarly, the seven
**pariharagāthās** (verses of refutation) starting with "**Ogāḍhayā**" have been
explained in the previous order.  Thus, in the nine **adhikaras** (chapters) on
the **Jīvāastikāya** (categories of the soul), including **Prabhutva**
(sovereignty) and other topics, the **Jīvā aṇāiṇihaṇā** (the soul is not a
destroyer) and the other eighteen **gāthās** collectively explain the
**kṛtṛtva** (agency), **bhoktṛtva** (enjoyment), and **karma-samyuktatva**
(being connected with karma) together.  **Hindi Summary:**  **Gāthā 70**
explains the importance of being free from karma, even after attaining
**Prabhutva** (sovereignty).  **General Meaning:**  The **Jina** (liberated
soul) teaches that the **Bhavya** (evolving soul) attains the **Mokshamarg**
(path of liberation) by following the **Samayagnyāna** (right knowledge) and
becoming **dhīra** (steadfast). They overcome **moha** (delusion) and reach
**Nivvāṇapura** (city of liberation).  **Specific Meaning:**  The **Bhavya**
understands the **Nischya** (knowledge), **Vyavahar** (conduct), and
**Mokshamarg** (path of liberation) taught by the **Vītarāga** (free from
attachment) and **Sarvajña** (omniscient) **Praṇīta** (liberated soul). They
attain **Upasama** (sublimation), **Samyaktva** (right faith), **Kṣayopasama**
(sublimation of karma), and **Kṣāyika Samyaktva** (right faith leading to
liberation). They remain steadfast in their **Nischya Ratna Tray** (three jewels
of certainty) even during **ghāropaśarga** (severe trials), like the
**Pāṇḍavas** (heroes of the Mahabharata). They overcome **moha** (delusion) and
reach **Nivvāṇapura** (city of liberation), which is characterized by
**atyāvāśa** (supreme bliss), **sukha** (happiness), and **anantpaṇā** (infinite
qualities), and is the realization of the **śuddhatmā** (pure soul).  This is
the explanation of **karma-rahittva** (being free from karma) in the second
**gāthā** (verse).  Similarly, the seven **pariharagāthās** (verses of

order.  Thus, in the nine **adhikaras** (chapters) on the **Jīvāastikāya**

topics, the **Jīvā aṇāiṇihaṇā** (the soul is not a destroyer) and the other
eighteen **gāthās** collectively explain the **kṛtṛtva** (agency), **bhoktṛtva**
(enjoyment), and **karma-samyuktatva** (being connected with karma) together.

## Description of the Six Categories of the Soul  **Verse 71-72**  **Time
Explanation**  The soul is described as one, two-fold, three-marked, four-
moving, five-quality-dominant, six-category-bound, seven-fold-existent, eight-
based, nine-meaningful, and ten-located.  **Verse 71**  * **One:** The soul is
one because it is eternally conscious and active. * **Two-fold:** The soul is
two-fold because of the difference between knowledge and perception. * **Three-
marked:** The soul is three-marked because it is characterized by the difference
between karma, its fruits, and the knowledge of action.  **Verse 72**  * **Four-
moving:** The soul is four-moving because it moves through the four states of
existence. * **Five-quality-dominant:** The soul is five-quality-dominant
because it is primarily characterized by the five qualities of the soul:
*parinaamika*, *audarika*, etc. * **Six-category-bound:** The soul is six-
category-bound because it is bound by the six categories of existence: upward,
downward, and the four directions. * **Seven-fold-existent:** The soul is seven-
fold-existent because it exists in the seven states of being: *asti*, *nasti*,
etc. * **Eight-based:** The soul is eight-based because it is the basis of the
eight qualities of karma. * **Nine-meaningful:** The soul is nine-meaningful
because it is the essence of the nine categories of reality. * **Ten-located:**
The soul is ten-located because it resides in the ten locations of existence:
earth, water, fire, air, plants, and the five senses.  **Hindi Time
Explanation**  The verses describe the different categories of the soul.

## The Soul: A Detailed Description  **The Soul (Jiva)** is described as:  (1)
**One** (Eka):  Just as a single lump of gold represents all gold, the soul,
with its infinite qualities of knowledge, etc., represents the pure soul
category.  (2) **Great Soul** (Mahapa):  The soul is also considered a Great
Soul due to its inherent potential for liberation and its ability to attain
perfect knowledge and vision. (3) **Suitable** (Uvajutta):  The soul is suitable
for liberation because it possesses the potential for perfect knowledge and
vision. (4) **Two-fold** (Duviyappa):  The soul can be categorized as either a
worldly soul (samsari) or a liberated soul (mukta). It can also be categorized
as either destined for liberation (bhavya) or not destined for liberation
(abhavya). (5) **Three-marked** (Tilakkhano):  The soul is characterized by
three marks: knowledge, karma, and the fruit of karma. It can also be
characterized by three other sets of three:      * Knowledge, perception, and
conduct     * Substance, quality, and mode     * Origination, decay, and
permanence (6) **Four-fold in movement** (Chadu Sankamo):  Although the soul's
true nature is unchanging and blissful, it appears to move through the four
realms of hell, animal, human, and heavenly beings due to its attachment to
false beliefs and desires. (7) **Five-fold in dominant qualities**
(Panchaggagunapphaano):  Although the soul's true nature is characterized by the
two qualities of impermanence and purity, it is generally dominated by the five
main qualities:  audayika, etc. (8) **Six-fold in deviation**
(Chhakkaavakamajutto):  The soul is characterized by six deviations, which are
the six directions of movement (up, down, and the four cardinal directions) that
it takes when transitioning to another existence. (9) **Seven-fold in
existence** (Sattbhangasambhavo):  The soul's existence is characterized by
seven categories of existence: being, non-being, etc. (10) **Eight-fold in
dependence** (Atthasavo):  The soul is dependent on eight karmas (knowledge-
obscuring, etc.) or eight qualities (right faith, etc.). (11) **Nine-fold in
substance** (Nava-artharoopa):  The soul exists as one of the nine substances.
(12) **Ten-fold in location** (Dasasthanagata):  The soul can be found in ten
different locations: earth, water, fire, air, ordinary plants, specific plants,
two-sensed beings, three-sensed beings, four-sensed beings, and five-sensed
beings.

##  Six Substances - Description of the Five Astikayas  Though the soul is the
abode of the eight virtues like perfect knowledge, in practical terms, it is the
source of the eight karmas and the eight types of knowledge-obscuring karmas.
Though it appears as a single, undivided entity of pure knowledge, in the state
of non-discriminatory samadhi, in practical terms, it is like gold in various
forms, found in different colors. Though it is essentially pure consciousness,
in practical terms, it is found in ten locations, namely earth, water, fire,
air, space, plants, two-senses, three-senses, four-senses, and five-senses. Who
is this? It is the soul - the soul substance. Thus, it exists in ten forms.
Alternatively, in the second explanation, when the ten locations are explained
separately, using appropriate terms, then those ten locations also become ten
forms. Thus, there are twenty forms in total, combining both explanations.
**Hindi Meaning:**  This section further elaborates on the soul substance, as
described in the previous nine chapters, by explaining its ten forms, leading to
a total of twenty forms.  **General Meaning with Anvaya:**  (Uvadatto) The soul,
which is useful (Eko cheva mahayya) is one great soul, in terms of its essence.
(So duviyapppo) The same soul is of two types. (Tilakkhano hodi) It has three
characteristics. (Chaduchankamano bhanido) It is said to be of four types, due
to its movement in the four realms. (Panchaggagunappadhanno ya) It is of five
forms, due to its possession of five main qualities. (Chhakkapakkamajutto) It is
of six forms, due to its movement in six directions. (Sattabhang sabbhavo) It is
of seven forms, due to its being established by seven categories. (Atthasao) It
is of eight forms, due to being the abode of eight virtues. (Navattho) It is of
nine forms, due to being present in nine substances. (Das thanago) It is of ten
forms, due to being present in ten locations. (Jivo) This soul is said to be
(bhanido) of ten forms.  **Specific Meaning:**  Just as gold is considered one,
despite its various forms and qualities, due to its inherent nature, similarly,
the soul is considered one, despite its infinite qualities like perfect
knowledge and perfect vision, due to its inherent nature as a pure soul.
Alternatively, the soul is considered one, due to the presence of perfect vision
and perfect knowledge in all souls. This is the common characteristic, making
the soul one. Some may argue that just as the moon appears in different forms in
different water-filled pots, similarly, the soul appears in different forms in
different bodies. This doubt is resolved by stating that the moon's rays are
reflected in the water, making the water particles appear like the moon, not the
moon itself. Similarly, the soul is not changing its form, but its qualities are
reflected in the body.

The five astikayas have been explained. In this, there is also an example - just
as in various mirrors, due to the dependence on the face of Devadatta, i.e., the
face being reflected in the cleanliness of the mirrors, the pudgalas of the
various mirrors have undergone transformation in the form of various faces. The
face of Devadatta has not undergone transformation into many forms of faces. If
this were to happen, then the reflection of the face in the mirror would attain
the state of consciousness, which does not happen. In the same way, one moon
does not undergo transformation into various forms, and no single substance
called Brahma is seen which would become of various types like the moon. This
implies that one jiva cannot transform into various jivas, only the species
aspect or the aspect of common qualities is one type for all jivas, and this
jiva is of two types in terms of the aspect of perception-action, or the aspect
of worldly and liberated, or the aspect of bhavya and abhavya. The same jiva is
of three characteristics in terms of the aspect of knowledge-consciousness,
karma-consciousness, or karma-result-consciousness, or the aspect of production-
expenditure-maturity, or the aspect of samyagdarshan, samyagjnan,
samyagcharitra, or the aspect of dravya-guna-paryaya. Although it possesses the
nature of remaining in the state of Siddha-gati by possessing the single
characteristic of being unchanging, pure, and full of knowledge and bliss, due
to its wandering in the four gatis of hell, etc., due to its transformation in
the states of mithyadarshan and emotions like raga and dvesha, it is said to be
of four types. Although it possesses the two characteristics of being kshayika
and pure parinamik, due to its dwelling in the five main bhavya states of
audayika, etc., it is of five types. And the same jiva is of six types due to
its being associated with six upkrama. The meaning of this statement is that the
one in which the reverse order is destroyed is called upkrama, i.e., this jiva
goes to the end of death in the upward, downward, and four directions - east,
west, south, north, as it is said - "Anushreni gati" that the movement of the
jiva is sequential. It does not go in crooked directions. For this reason, it is
of six types. The same jiva is proved by the seven bhangas of dravya - syat
asti, syat nasti, syat astinasti, syat avaktvy, syat asti avaktvy, syat nasti
avaktvy, syat astinasti avaktvy, so it is of seven types. Although this jiva is
the basis of eight qualities like samyaktva, etc., which are characterized by
being free from attachment, etc., due to its being associated with eight karmas
like jnana-avaran, etc., and asrava, it is of eight types. Although this jiva
appears as one undivided knowledge-form in the state of nirvikalpa samadhi,
which is a common quality found in all jivas, due to its pervading in nine
substances like jiva, ajiv, asrava, bandha, samvara, nirjara, moksha, punya,
papa, like gold spread in various gold substances, it is of nine forms. Although
it is the possessor of the single characteristic of pure buddhi,

## 208. Description of the Six Ways and Five Bodies  However, according to the
practical point of view, due to being earth, water, fire, air, each plant,
ordinary plant, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed, there
are ten locations or ten forms. Or, if these ten locations of earth, etc., are
taken separately, and the above terms are explained separately, then there are
also ten locations. By combining both, this living being becomes twenty-fold.
This is the meaning. ||71-72||  **Time Explanation Verse 73**  **Pali:**
*Payaḍḍiḍi - aṇubhāga-ppadeśa bandhehiṁ savvado mukko. Uḍḍuṁ gacchadi sesa
vidisā - vajjaṁ gadiṁ janti.* ||73||  **Sanskrit:**
*Prakṛtisthityanubhāgapradeśabandhaiḥ sarvato muktaḥ. Ūrdhvam gacchati śeṣā
vidigvaj gatiṁ yānti.* ||73||  **Explanation:** The bound living being has six
ways of going due to karma, but the liberated one has only one upward movement,
which is natural. This is stated here. ||73||  **Hindi Time Explanation 73**
**Meaning:** (Prakṛtisthityanubhāgapradeśabandhaiḥ) The living being who is free
from the bonds of nature, state, part, and region (sarvato muktaḥ) goes upward
(ūrdhvam gacchati), while the rest (śeṣāḥ) go to other existences (bhavantaram)
leaving behind the directions (vidigvaj gatiṁ yānti).  **Commentary:** The bound
living being has six ways of going (six directions) due to karma, while the
liberated living being also has one natural upward movement. This is stated
here. ||73||  Thus, the explanation of the body of the living being is complete.
**Sanskrit Meaning Explanation Verse 73**  Now, it is stated that the liberated
one has an upward movement, while the worldly beings have six ways at the time
of death. *Paryāḍḍiḍi aṇubhāgapadeśabandhehiṁ savvado mukko* - The liberated
one, being free from all attachments, is free from the forms of nature, state,
part, and region, and is pure, with the power of meditation, which is the
characteristic of pure self-realization. *Uṅkaṁ gacchadi* - Being endowed with
natural infinite knowledge and other qualities, he goes upward, which is the
characteristic of one-time movement. *Sesa* - The rest of the worldly beings,
*vidisāvajjaṁ gardi janti* - at the time of death, they go in the direction of
the six ways, which are mentioned earlier, and which are the characteristics of
the sequence of the six ways. In the verse, *“Sadasiva sankho makkani buddho
neiyāigo ya vaisesa. Mandalī daṁsaṇa vidūṣaṇa kayaan aṭṭha”* (Gommatasara
Jīvakāṇḍa Gāthā 69-68), the meaning of the eight kinds of karma is stated, and
the eight kinds of karma are prohibited.

The second verse describes the nature of the Siddhas, stating that they are free
from the five astikayas and are liberated. The Siddhas are described as being
free from the eight karmas and residing in the highest realm. This verse refutes
the Sadashiva doctrine, which claims that the soul is always free from karmic
impurities. It also refutes the Mimamsa doctrine, which denies the existence of
liberation. Furthermore, it refutes the Sankhya doctrine, which claims that the
soul is not happy in liberation. The verse also states that the Siddhas are
never bound by karma again.   This is the fourth chapter of the first Maha-
Adhikara, which deals with the six substances, specifically the Jiva-astikaya.
This chapter consists of 35 verses, which are divided into three sections: the
first verse introduces the nine Adhikaras, the next three verses describe the
nature of the Jiva, the next two verses describe the Jiva's body, the next three
verses describe the Jiva's non-material nature, the next two verses describe the
Jiva's three types of consciousness, the next 19 verses describe the Jiva's
knowledge and perception, the next 18 verses describe the Jiva's actions, and
the final three verses are in the form of a Chulika.

## 210 **Description of the Six Substances and the Five Astikayas**  The term
"unstained" (niranjjan) refutes the view of the Maskari ascetics, who believe
that after liberation, karma-binding and worldly existence return. (5) The
liberated souls (siddhas) are imperishable. They never abandon the nature of
their pure, conscious substance. This refutes the Buddhist view, which does not
accept any eternal substance in ultimate reality. They consider consciousness to
be momentary and a product of the chain of causation. (6) The liberated souls
possess the eight qualities of perfect knowledge, perfect vision, infinite
power, subtle qualities, the ability to perceive, the qualities of greatness and
smallness, and the quality of unimpededness. This refutes the Nyaya and
Vaisheshika views, which consider the absence of knowledge and other qualities
as liberation. (7) The liberated souls are fulfilled. They have nothing left to
do and are perfectly content. This refutes the view of those who consider God to
be the creator. (8) The liberated souls reside in the upper part of the
universe. This refutes the view of the Mandalika, who say that the soul always
moves upwards and never rests anywhere. This verse refutes eight different
views.  The liberated souls are free from eight types of karma: the karma of
delusion obscures perfect knowledge, the karma of knowledge-obscuration and
vision-obscuration obscures perfect knowledge and perfect vision, the karma of
obstruction obscures infinite power, the karma of name obscures subtle
qualities, the karma of lifespan obscures the ability to perceive, the karma of
lineage obscures the qualities of greatness and smallness, and the karma of
experience obscures the quality of unimpededness. With the destruction of these
eight karmas, the eight qualities of the liberated souls become manifest. The
second verse describes the nature of the liberated soul by stating that they
reside in the upper part of the universe. ||73||  Thus, three verses have been
spoken in the form of a chulika, explaining the nine rights regarding the jiva-
astikaya.  In this way, the first verse informs about the nine rights, including
the statement "jiva utti havdi cheda," etc. The second verse emphasizes the
sovereignty. The third verse describes the nature of the jiva. The second verse
states that the body is evidence. The third verse explains the intangible
qualities. The second verse describes the three types of consciousness. The next
verse explains the knowledge, vision, and use. The eighteenth verse mainly
explains the concepts of doership, enjoyership, and karma-boundness. The three
verses are in the form of a chulika. In this way, thirty-three verses have been
spoken in the first maha-adhikaran, which describes the six substances and the
five astikayas, and the fourth antar-adhikaran, called jiva-astikaya, is
complete.

## The Fourfold Nature of Pudgala  This is an explanation of the nature of
Pudgala dravya.  **The fourfold nature of Pudgala dravya is to be known:**  *
**Skandha:**  Skandha * **Skandhadesa:** Skandha-region * **Skandhapradesa:**
Skandha-subregion * **Paramāṇu:** Atom  **Explanation:**  Pudgala dravya exists
in these four forms: sometimes as Skandha, sometimes as Skandhadesa, sometimes
as Skandhapradesa, and sometimes as Paramāṇu. There is no other possibility.
This is why they are said to have fourfold nature.  **Further Explanation:**
This is a statement about the different forms of Pudgala dravya.  Pudgala dravya
exists in the world sometimes as Skandha, sometimes as Skandhadesa, sometimes as
Skandhapradesa, and sometimes as Paramāṇu. There is no other possibility. This
is why they are said to have fourfold nature.

## Translation:  **212**  There are descriptions of the six substances and the
five categories of matter. There are atoms and aggregates of atoms. Thus, these
four types of pudgala-kaya should be known. These four types are to be known as
aggregates, atoms, and the distinction between them. Here, the meaning is that
this pudgala-dravya is an object of renunciation because it is different from
the infinite, blissful, pure jiva-astikaya, which is worthy of being grasped.
||74||  **Commentary:**  There are ten verses in the section on pudgala-
astikaya, which is worthy of renunciation, being different from the pure jiva-
astikaya, which is characterized by infinite bliss and consciousness. Among
these, four verses are primarily about the aggregates, starting with the verse
"Khandā ya Khandadeso". Then, five verses are primarily about the atoms, in
another section. Among these five, one verse, "Sanchesim Khandānam", describes
the nature of the atom. One verse, "Ādesamatta", refutes the idea that different
types of matter like earth, water, etc., arise from atoms. One verse, "Saddo
Khandappabhavō", establishes that the word "pudgala" is a synonym for the
substance. One verse, "Nichoṇāṇavagāsō", describes the time, etc., based on the
space occupied by the atomic substance, and mentions the number, unity, etc. One
verse, "Airasavaṇṇa", describes the taste, color, etc., of the atomic substance.
Thus, there are five verses in another section, collectively describing the
atomic substance. Then, one verse, "Uvabhojjā", describes the contraction of the
pudgala-astikaya. Thus, there are ten verses in three sections, collectively
describing the pudgala-astikaya. Further, four types of pudgala are described.
**General Meaning with Anvaya:**  (Khandā) Aggregate (ya) and (Khandadesa)
aggregate-space (ya) and (Khandapadesa) aggregate-region, these are three types
of aggregates, and (Paramāṇū) atom (hoti) exists. (Idi) These (Chaduviyappā)
four types (Te Poggalakāya) those pudgala-kaya (Muṇeyavya) should be known.
**Specific Meaning:**  Here, the meaning is that this pudgala-dravya is an
object of renunciation because it is different from the infinite, blissful, pure
jiva-astikaya, which is worthy of being grasped. ||74||  **75**  (Khandam)
Aggregate is (Sayalasammattham) all-pervading, (Tassa) of it (Du) two (Addham)
halves (Bhaṇanti) are said (Deso) space. (Addhaddham) Half of half (Cha) and
(Padeso) region (Paramāṇū) atom (Cheva) also (A विभागी) indivisible. ||75||
**Translation:**  The aggregate is all-pervading. They say that space is half of
it. Half of half is region, and the atom is indivisible. ||75||

This is a description of the different forms of the pudgala dravya.  Even though
it is made up of an infinite number of atoms, the one that is made up of all of
them is called a skandha. Half of that is called a skandhadesa, and half of that
is called a skandhapradesa. In this way, due to the difference, there are an
infinite number of skandhapradesa forms, from the dvianuka skandha. The
indivisible, single-part skandha is the single atom.  Again, from the
combination of two atoms, there is one dvianuka skandha form. In this way, due
to the combination, there are an infinite number of skandha forms. In this way,
due to both difference and combination, there are an infinite number of forms.

## Chapter 214: Description of the Sixfold and Fivefold Categories  This chapter
explains the characteristics of each of the four categories (Skandha, Skandha-
Desha, Skandha-Pradesha, and Paramanu) mentioned earlier.  **General Meaning
with Anvaya:**  * **Skandha** is a collection of many atoms. * **Skandha-Desha**
is half of the atoms in a Skandha. * **Skandha-Pradesha** is half of the
Skandha-Desha. * **Paramanu** is the smallest indivisible atom.  **Specific
Meaning:**  A collection of atoms, combined together in an unbroken form, is
called a Skandha. This is a single mass of infinite atoms, and it is called a
Skandha.   For example, consider a Skandha formed by 16 atoms. By reducing the
number of atoms one by one, we can identify different types of Skandhas,
starting from a Skandha with 9 atoms (the smallest) and ending with a Skandha
with 16 atoms (the largest). The Skandhas with 10 to 15 atoms are the
intermediate types.  A collection of 8 atoms is called Skandha-Desha, as it is
half of the 16-atom Skandha. By reducing the number of atoms one by one, we can
identify different types of Skandha-Desha, starting from a Skandha-Desha with 5
atoms (the smallest) and ending with a Skandha-Desha with 8 atoms (the largest).
The Skandha-Deshas with 6 and 7 atoms are the intermediate types.  A collection
of 4 atoms is called Skandha-Pradesha. By reducing the number of atoms one by
one, we can identify different types of Skandha-Pradesha, starting from a
Skandha-Pradesha with 2 atoms (the smallest) and ending with a Skandha-Pradesha
with 4 atoms (the largest). The Skandha-Pradesha with 3 atoms is the
intermediate type.  The smallest indivisible particle is called a Paramanu.
Skandhas are formed by the combination of Paramanus. A Skandha formed by two
Paramanus is called a Vyaguna Skandha, and a Skandha formed by three Paramanus
is called a Tryanuka Skandha. In this way, we can identify Skandhas formed by an
infinite number of Paramanus.  Thus, there are infinite types of Skandhas formed
by both the difference (Bheda) and the combination (Sanghata) of Paramanus and
Skandhas. This means that Skandhas are formed by the combination of Paramanus or
Skandhas, and smaller Skandhas are formed by the difference of larger Skandhas.
Also, Skandhas are formed by both the difference and combination of Paramanus,
such as when some Paramanus are removed and others are added.  The implication
here is that all these Pudgalas are different from the Supreme Self, which is
worthy of being attained. This is the fruit of the knowledge of Pudgalas.
**Verse 75:** This explains the application of Pudgalas in Skandhas.  **Verse
76:** This explains that the application of Pudgalas in Skandhas is like the
application of oil in a lamp.

The twenty-one-five skandhas, beginning with the Badara-Sookshma, are called
Pudgala. They are of six types, from which the three worlds are created. || 76
||   Because of their special qualities of touch, taste, smell, and color, and
because of their increase and decrease in the six locations, and because of
their nature of filling and dissolving, and because of the filling and
dissolving that occurs due to the appearance and disappearance of the individual
skandhas, the atoms are called Pudgala. The skandhas are called Pudgala because
they are made up of many Pudgalas and are not different from them. They have
become six types due to the differences in their Badara and Sookshma forms, and
they exist in the form of the three worlds. These six types of skandhas are: (1)
Badara-Badara, (2) Badara, (3) Badara-Sookshma, (4) Sookshma-Badara, (5)
Sookshma, (6) Sookshma-Sookshma.   Here, (1) wood, stone, etc., which cannot
join themselves after being broken, are Badara-Badara. (2) Milk, ghee, oil,
water, juice, etc., which can join themselves after being broken, are Badara.
(3) Shadow, sunlight, darkness, moonlight, etc., which cannot be cut, broken, or
grasped even though they are gross, are Badara-Sookshma. (4) Touch, taste,
smell, and sound, which are gross even though they are subtle, are Sookshma-
Badara. (5) Karma-Vargana, etc., which are subtle and cannot be perceived by the
senses, are Sookshma. (6) Those which are extremely subtle, from Karma-Vargana
down to the Dvi-Anuka-Skandha, are Sookshma-Sookshma. || 76 ||

176 ||  **English Translation:**  This text describes the concept of pudgal
(matter) in Jain philosophy, specifically focusing on the six substances
(ṣaḍdravya) and the five astikayas (types of matter).  It states that while in
absolute knowledge (niścaya), only atoms (paramāṇu) are considered pudgal, in
practical knowledge (vyavahāra), even aggregates of atoms, including those in
subtle and gross forms (bādarasūksmagataskaṇḍhā), are considered pudgal.  These
aggregates of atoms are classified into six types (ṣaṭprakārāḥ), which are
responsible for the creation of the three realms (trailokya). The text
emphasizes that the three realms are not created by any particular being
(puruṣaviśeṣa) but are formed by the six substances, including pudgal.  The text
also mentions that the living being (jīva) is considered a pure being
(siddhārūpa) in absolute knowledge, but in practical knowledge, it is
categorized based on its various characteristics, including its lifespan,
strength, senses, and breath.  The text concludes by stating that the three
realms are composed of the six substances, including pudgal, and are not
created, destroyed, or maintained by any particular being.

## The Atom (Paramanu)  **217**  **217** The atom is defined as follows:  The
atom is the ultimate constituent of all the skandhas (aggregates). It is
eternal, soundless, indivisible, and the source of form. ||77||  The ultimate
constituent of all the skandhas, know that as the atom! It is eternal,
soundless, indivisible, and the source of form. ||77||  The ultimate difference
among the various forms of the skandhas is the atom. It is indivisible due to
the absence of division, it is one due to being indivisible and having a single
location, it is eternal due to being indestructible as a material substance, and
it is the source of form due to being generated from the transformation of form,
etc. It is also soundless, as sound is not a property of the atom, and it will
be explained further as a form of the pudgala skandha (matter aggregate). ||77||
**Meaning of the verse:**  (Of all the skandhas) All the skandhas (the ultimate
constituent) the ultimate part (that) it (the atom know) know as the atom (it)
it (indivisible) indivisible (one) one, (single location) (eternal) eternal,
(the source of form) the source of form (generated from form) and (soundless)
soundless.  **Commentary:**  This is the explanation of the atom.  The ultimate
difference (smallest part) among the previously mentioned forms of the skandhas
is the atom. And it is indivisible due to the absence of division, it is one due
to being indivisible and having a single location, it is eternal due to being
indestructible as a material substance, and it is the source of form due to
being generated from the transformation of form, etc. It is also soundless, as
sound is not a property of the atom, and it will be explained further (in verse
79) as a form of the pudgala skandha (matter aggregate). ||77||  **Translation
of the Sanskrit text:**  Now, he explains those six differences: earth, water,
light, the object of sight, the object of the four senses, and karma-related.
Those that are past karma are the six types of pudgalas. What are they like?
They are coarse-coarse, coarse-fine, fine-coarse, and fine-fine. For example:
those that are broken and cannot be joined together by themselves are coarse-
coarse, like mountains and earth; those that are broken but can be joined
together immediately by themselves are coarse-fine, like ghee, oil, and water;
those that cannot be grasped by hand or moved from one place to another are
fine-coarse, like light and heat; those that are not the object of sight are
fine-coarse, like the object of the four senses; and those that are not suitable
for the destruction of the karma of knowledge-obscuration, etc., are fine-fine.

## Chapter 218: Description of the Six Substances and Five Subtle Bodies
**Verse 1:** The objects of the senses, which are described as the six
substances and five subtle bodies, are extremely subtle and beyond the reach of
karma. They are extremely subtle, ranging from those beyond the reach of karma
to the subtle particles of the skandha.  **Commentary:**  * **General Meaning:**
There are six types of pudgala (matter) - four objects of the senses (excluding
earth, water, shadow, and visual objects), karma-worthy pudgala, and subtle
skandhas formed by karma. * **Specific Meaning:** There are six types of
pudgala: (1) Gross-Gross, (2) Gross, (3) Gross-Subtle, (4) Subtle-Gross, (5)
Subtle, (6) Subtle-Subtle.     * **Gross-Gross:** Those that cannot be reunited
when broken down, such as mountains, earth, pots, and cloth.     * **Gross:**
Those that can be reunited immediately when separated, such as ghee, oil, and
water.     * **Gross-Subtle:** Those that can be seen but cannot be picked up
and moved, such as shadow, sunlight, and light.     * **Subtle-Gross:** Those
that cannot be seen with the eyes, such as air, taste, smell, and sound (objects
of the other four senses).     * **Subtle:** Those that cannot be perceived by
any sense, such as the pudgala that is the object of the jnana (knowledge) of
the liberated soul.     * **Subtle-Subtle:** Those that are even subtler than
karma, extending to the two-atom skandha.  **This verse is not found in the
commentary by Amrit Chandra.**  **Thus, the first four verses of this chapter
primarily focus on the explanation of the skandha.**  **Verse 2:**  Next, the
second chapter focuses on the explanation of the paramanu (atom).  **Verse 3:**
The paramanu is described as having the qualities of eternity, non-sound,
oneness, and indivisibility.  * **Eternity:** Just as the supreme soul is
eternal due to its unchanging nature and existence as the cause of all things,
the paramanu is also eternal due to its existence as pudgala. * **Non-Sound:**
Just as the pure soul, although the object of knowledge and self-awareness, is
not sound, the paramanu, although the cause of sound, is not sound itself. *
**Oneness:** Just as the pure soul is one and without any dependence on anything
else, the paramanu is also one and independent of any other substance. *
**Indivisibility:** Just as the supreme soul, although encompassing countless
worlds, is indivisible because it is one and without parts, the paramanu is also
indivisible because it is without parts.  **Verse 4:**  The paramanu is also
described as having the quality of being the source of form.  * **Source of
Form:** The paramanu is the source of form because it is the origin of the
tangible form that has touch, taste, smell, and color.  **Thus, the first verse
of the second chapter describes the nature of the paramanu.**

## Five Astikayas: The Atom  **219**  **Hin. 0ta. - Uththānika -**  After the
explanation of the atom, five verses are mentioned in another place. The first
verse states that the atom is eternal and possesses other qualities.  **General
Meaning with Anvaya:** (Sabdhesi) All (khandhāṇam) of the skandhas (jo anto)
which is the ultimate division (tam) that (paramāṇu) atom (viyāṇ) know (so) it
(sassado) is imperishable, (aso) soundless, (ekko) one, (avibhāgī) indivisible,
and (muttibhavo) material.  **Explanation:** Just as the Supreme Soul, being the
knower, the seer, and of one nature, is imperishable from the standpoint of the
substance-theory, and is therefore eternal, so also the atom, due to its
inherent nature of being a particle, is eternal. Just as the pure soul, being
the object of self-awareness, is not the object of sound or sound-like, even
though it is the cause of sound, so also the atom, though the cause of sound in
its potential form, is not sound in its actual form, and is therefore soundless.
Just as the pure soul, being a substance, is said to be one, without any
external attributes, so also the atom, being devoid of any external attributes
like particles, etc., is one, or one-located. Just as the Supreme Soul, being a
substance, is infinite in its locations, like the space of the universe, yet is
indivisible due to its being one, undivided substance, so also the atom, being
without parts, is indivisible. Further, the atom, being different from the
immaterial Supreme Soul, is material, being born from touch, taste, smell,
color, and form. This is the meaning.  **77**  This is the nature of the atom,
as stated in the first verse in another place.  **Refutation of the Difference
in the Nature of Atoms:**  **Ādesa -** Metta-mutto dhādu- chadukkassa kāraṇam jo
du. So o paramāṇū pariṇāma- guṇo say-masaddo. **78**  **Translation:** The one
who is the cause of the four elements, being only a modification, is to be known
as the atom, a modification-quality, itself soundless. **78**

## Translation:  **220**  **Description of the Five Categories of Substance**
The qualities of touch, taste, smell, and color, which are the basis of the
materiality of atoms, are differentiated only by designation. In reality, just
as the same region is the beginning, middle, and end of an atom, so too, because
the substance and its qualities are inseparable in their region, the same region
is that of the atom, that of touch, that of taste, that of smell, and that of
color. Therefore, if in some atoms the quality of smell is diminished, in some
the qualities of smell and taste are diminished, and in some the qualities of
smell, taste, and color are diminished, then the atom, inseparable from that
quality, would be destroyed. Therefore, the diminution of any quality is not
appropriate. Hence, the four elements of earth, water, fire, and air have only
one atom as their cause, because the varied quality of the atom, due to its
transformation, sometimes assumes a varied outcome through the manifestation or
non-manifestation of some quality. Just as it is acknowledged that the qualities
of smell, etc., are present in an unmanifest form in the atom due to its
transformation, so too, it is not possible to know that sound is also present in
an unmanifest form, because there is a contradiction in the unity of a single-
region atom with sound, which is multi-regional. || 78 ||  **Commentary:**  This
is a refutation of the view that atoms are of different types.  The qualities of
touch, taste, smell, and color, which are the basis of materiality, are
differentiated from atoms only by designation (i.e., by name). In reality, just
as the same region is the beginning, middle, and end of an atom, so too, because
the substance and its qualities are inseparable in their region, the same region
is that of the atom, that of touch, that of taste, that of smell, and that of
color. Therefore, if in some atoms the quality of smell is diminished, in some
the qualities of smell and taste are diminished, and in some the qualities of
smell, taste, and color are diminished, then the atom, inseparable from that
quality, would be destroyed. Therefore, the diminution of any quality is not
appropriate. Hence, the four elements of earth, water, fire, and air have only
one atom as their cause, because the varied quality of the atom, due to its
transformation, sometimes assumes a varied outcome through the manifestation or
non-manifestation of some quality.  Just as it is acknowledged that the
qualities of smell, etc., are present in an unmanifest form in the atom due to
its transformation, so too, it is not possible to know that sound is also
present in an unmanifest form, because there is a contradiction in the unity of
a single-region atom with sound, which is multi-regional. || 78 ||
**Translation of the Sanskrit Text:**  Therefore, it is established that there
are no atoms of different types like earth, etc. The qualities like color, etc.,
which are the basis of the materiality of atoms, are differentiated only by
designation (i.e., by name).

The second verse deals with the refutation of the difference in the types of
atoms like earth, etc.  **Translation:**  The five-pointed star, etc., are not
differentiated by the region of existence. In reality, the region that is the
beginning, middle, and end of the atom is the same as the region of the
qualities like form, etc., or is called the form, etc. It is not seen by sight,
so it is only a form by inference. The cause of the four elements is the atom,
which is known to be the same atom that was mentioned earlier, which transforms
into the four elements of earth, etc., over time. The quality of transformation
is the quality of transformation, being devoid of the four states of arising,
etc. Again, what is special? The meaning of the sutra is that it is itself non-
sound, being different from the sound, which is a synonym for the mass of
infinite atoms, due to its being one region.  **Explanation:**  The verse
explains that atoms are not differentiated by their location or region. The same
atom that constitutes the beginning, middle, and end of the atom is also the
same as the region of qualities like form, etc. This atom is not seen by sight
but is inferred from its qualities. The atom is the cause of the four elements
(earth, water, fire, and air) and is the same atom that was mentioned earlier.
It transforms into the four elements over time. The quality of transformation is
the quality of transformation, being devoid of the four states of arising, etc.
The atom is also non-sound, being different from the sound, which is a synonym
for the mass of infinite atoms. This is because the atom is one region and is
not a collection of many atoms.  **Terms:**  * **Panchaastikaya:** Five-pointed

## Verse 222  This verse refutes the claim that there are different types of
earth, etc., within atoms. It also explains that sound is a synonym for the
pudgala skandha.  **Verse 79:**  * **Sound originates from the skandha.** *
**The skandha is an aggregation of atoms.** * **When these skandhas collide,
sound is produced.** * **This production of sound is constant.**
**Explanation:**  In this world, sound is perceived by the sense of hearing and
understood by the mind. It is essentially a synonym for a single skandha
composed of infinite atoms. It originates from the skandhas, which are the
external causes, because sound is produced when these skandhas collide.
Furthermore, even though the entire world is filled with infinite, naturally
occurring, sound-producing groups of atoms that interpenetrate and permeate
everything, sound only manifests when there is an external cause. This means
that sound is constantly produced, making it a product of the skandha.
**Anvayaartha (Meaning in order):**  * **Sound originates from the skandha.** *
**The skandha is an aggregation of atoms.** * **When these skandhas collide,** *
**Sound is produced.** * **This production is constant.**  **Commentary:**  This
verse demonstrates that sound is a synonym for the pudgala skandha.

## Translation:  **Verse 79**  This verse explains that sound is synonymous with
the pudgala dravya. It states that sound is a specific type of sound that is
perceived by the ear and is characterized by its origin from the skandhas.   The
skandhas are formed by the aggregation of an infinite number of paramanus
(atoms). When these skandhas come into contact with each other, sound is
produced. This sound is a specific type of sound that arises from the
interaction of the skandhas.   There are two types of skandhas:   1. **Internal
skandhas:** These are subtle and are the fundamental cause of sound. They are
constantly present in the world. 2. **External skandhas:** These are gross and
are the external causes of sound. Examples include the movement of the tongue
and lips, the striking of a bell, the blowing of wind, and the rumbling of
clouds. These skandhas are not always present, but only when the necessary
conditions are met.  Sound is a specific type of sound that is produced by the
interaction of the skandhas. It is not a property of space or a quality of
space. If it were a quality of space, it would not be perceived by the ear
because space is formless.   There are two types of sound:  1. **Pragmatic
sound:** This is sound that is produced by human beings or other beings. 2.
**Vaisrasik sound:** This is sound that is produced by natural phenomena, such
as the wind, rain, or thunder.  Sound can also be classified as:  1. **Akshara
sound:** This is sound that is made up of letters and is used in languages like
Sanskrit and Prakrit. 2. **Anakshara sound:** This is sound that is not made up
of letters and includes sounds like the sounds of the senses and divine sounds.
The verse concludes by stating that all of this is to be rejected, and that the
true nature of the self is to be embraced.   **Anvaya:**  Sound is produced from
the skandhas. The skandhas are formed by the aggregation of an infinite number
of paramanus. When these skandhas come into contact with each other, sound is
produced. This sound is a specific type of sound that arises from the
interaction of the skandhas.  **General Meaning:**  This verse explains that
sound is synonymous with the pudgala dravya. It states that sound is a specific
type of sound that is perceived by the ear and is characterized by its origin
from the skandhas.   **Specific Meaning:**  The verse explains that there are
two types of skandhas: internal and external. Internal skandhas are subtle and
are the fundamental cause of sound. External skandhas are gross and are the
external causes of sound. The verse also explains that there are two types of
sound: pragmatic and vaisrasik. Pragmatic sound is produced by human beings or
other beings, while vaisrasik sound is produced by natural phenomena. The verse
concludes by stating that all of this is to be rejected, and that the true
nature of the self is to be embraced.

##  224  The six categories of existence and the five types of matter are gross
aggregates. They are found in some places in the world, but not everywhere.
Where there is a combination of both internal and external matter, there the
language-forms transform into words, but not everywhere. These words are
produced by language-forms according to rules. Their material cause is language-
forms, not the quality of space. If these words were the quality of space, they
would not be heard by the ear, because the quality of space should be
intangible. Or, from the word "Upyadago" in the verse, it can be understood that
this word is "experimental". It is produced by the inspiration of the soul, etc.
And the word "Niyado" means that the word is "natural" or inherent, like that
which comes from clouds, etc. Or, there are two types of words: language-form
and non-language-form. Language-form words are of two types: letter-form and
non-letter-form. The Sanskrit, Prakrit, etc. forms, which are the cause of the
speech of Aryans and non-Aryans, are letter-form. The words of the two senses,
etc., and the divine sound of the liberated Lord are non-letter-form. Now, non-
language-form is called, it also has two types: one experimental, the other
natural. That which is produced by the use of the soul is experimental, like the
sounds of the instruments "Tat", "Vitat", "Ghan", "Sushir", etc. It is said:
"One should know the instruments with strings like Veena, Sitar, etc. as "Tat",
the instruments like drums, etc. as "Vitat", the sounds of bells, clocks, etc.
as "Ghan", and the instruments like flutes, etc. that are blown as "Sushir". The
sounds that are produced due to clouds, etc. are natural or inherent. The
meaning is that all these are elements that should be abandoned, and the pure
soul-like element should be accepted. ||79||  Thus, the word is a synonym for
the pudgala substance. This is mainly established by the third verse.
"Paramanorekapradeshatvakhyapanamet." ||8||  "Nicco Ganavakaso Na Savakaso
Padesado Bheda. Khandhanam Pi Ya Kattha Pavihatta Kal-Sankhanam." ||8||  "Nityo
Nanavakaso Na Savakaso Pradeshato Bhetta. Skandhanam Api Cha Karta Pravibhakta
Kalasankhaya." ||8||  The atom is eternal because it is always imperishable,
being endowed with the general qualities of form, etc., in one space. It is non-
spacious because it gives space to the qualities of touch, etc., which are
indivisible and function in one space.

The atom, due to its single-region nature, is eternal (nitya), not devoid of
space (anavakasha), and not spacious (savakasha). It is the divider of the
skandhas because it is the cause of their differentiation with a single region.
It is the creator of the skandhas because it is the cause of their aggregation
with a single region. It is the divider of time because it divides the time-
characteristic period with a single region, which transcends a single space
region, by its own transformation of motion. It is also the divider of number
because it divides the number of substances in the skandhas with a single
region, which is preceded by the differentiation of two and so on, it divides
the number of areas with a single region, which is preceded by a single space
region that is limited by it, it divides the number of times with a single
region, which is preceded by time that is limited by the transformation of
motion that transcends a single space region, and it divides the number of
states with a single region, which is preceded by the knowledge of the states of
the subtle color, etc., that are transformed in it.

## Translation:  **226**  The description of the six substances and five
astikayas (categories) involves measurement in terms of atoms and sub-atoms.
This measurement is done using atoms, as sub-atoms are measured in relation to
atoms. The unit of measurement for space is 'Akashapradesh' (space region), and
its definition involves atoms. Therefore, the measurement of space is also done
using atoms. The unit of measurement for time is 'Samaya' (time), and its
definition involves atoms. Therefore, the measurement of time is also done using
atoms. The unit of measurement for knowledge and emotions is the amount of
knowledge required to know the smallest element of color, etc., which is present
in an atom. This definition involves atoms. Therefore, the measurement of
emotions (knowledge and emotions) is also done using atoms. In this way, atoms
are like meters for measuring substances, space, time, and emotions.  One atom
region is called 'Akashapradesh' (space region), which is a part of space. This
'Akashapradesh' is the unit of measurement for space. [For counting, the
quantity of any object that is considered as one measurement is called the unit
of that object.]  **3.** The time taken by an atom to move from one space region
to another adjacent space region (at a slow speed) is called 'Samaya' (time).
**Commentary:**  An atom is established as being one region, and it is eternal.
Why? Because an atom is always present in one region and never perishes. It is
not empty, but it is empty in the sense that it provides space for its own
qualities like color, etc. It is not empty in the sense that it is not empty of
the second, third, etc., regions. It is the destroyer of the skandhas
(aggregates). It is also the creator of the skandhas, like a living being. Just
as a living being, due to its attachment to its own region, becomes transformed
by the feeling of affection for the form of attachment, etc., and becomes the
destroyer of the karmic skandhas, similarly, an atom, due to its attachment to
its own region, becomes transformed by the feeling of affection and becomes the
destroyer of the skandhas at the time of their disintegration. Just as the same
living being, due to its detachment from the true self, becomes transformed by
the feeling of affection for the false attachment, etc., in its own region, and
becomes the creator of the karmic skandhas like the veil of knowledge, etc.,
similarly, the same atom, due to its feeling of affection in its own region,
becomes the creator of the skandhas like the qualities of the body, etc. Here,
the atom that is the destroyer of the skandhas is called the 'karyaparamanu'
(effect atom), and the one that is the creator is called the 'karanaparamanu'
(cause atom). Thus, there are two types of atoms: effect and cause. As it is
said: "The first one is the destroyer of the skandhas, and the second one is the
creator of the skandhas."  Alternatively, a second explanation is given
regarding the destroyer. This atom is the destroyer. Why? Because it is one
region, and it is different from the skandhas, which are many regions. This
skandha is the skandha. Why? Because it is many regions, and it is different
from the atom, which is one region.  Just like a living being, time and number
are divided. Just as a liberated being, with only the knowledge of one region,
divides the time of the experience of time and the number of time, similarly, an
atom, with one region, divides the time of the experience of time by moving
slowly from one atom to another.

The number is said to be the divider of the five astikayas and the infinite
numbers. Number is said to be of four types, in the form of the absence of
dravya and kshetra. Each of these is of two types, the inferior and the
superior. The inferior is in the form of one paramanu, the superior is in the
form of infinite paramanus, called dravya-samkhya. The inferior is in the form
of one pradesha, the superior is in the form of infinite pradeshas, called
kshetra-samkhya. The inferior is in the form of one samaya, the superior is in
the form of infinite samayas, called vyavahar-kal-samkhya. The power which is
the most inferior of all the powers like colour etc. in the paramanu-dravya, is
called the inferior bhava-samkhya. The power which is the most superior of all
the powers like colour etc. in the paramanu-dravya, is called the superior
bhava-samkhya. Thus, the inferior and superior of each of the dravya, kshetra,
kala, and bhava-samkhya should be known. ||80||  Thus, the fourth gatha has been
spoken, taking the paramanu-dravya and pradesha as the basis, and the statement
of samaya and other vyavahar-kal as the main point, and the statement of the
number like one etc. as the secondary point.  **General Meaning with Anvaya:**
This paramanu (niccho) is eternal (padesado) because its being one pradesha
never disappears. (naanavakaso) It does not give space to anyone (na savakaso)
because it is only one pradesha. (khandhanam vi ya kattha bhettha) It is the
creator of the skandhas and the destroyer of them. (kalasamkhanam) It is the
divider of the time, samaya, and other numbers.  **Specific Meaning:**  Just as
this jiva, by giving up the attachment in the form of raga etc. obtained in its
pradeshas, becomes the destroyer or annihilator of the karma-skandhas, so this
paramanu, by giving up the smoothness which is fit for bondage in one pradesha,
becomes the destroyer of the skandhas by becoming separate from them. And just
as the same jiva, by the opposite of the sneha-free paramatma-tattva, becomes
the creator of the new karma-skandhas like jnana-avaran etc. by becoming
transformed by the smooth feelings in the form of mithyatva, raga etc. obtained
in its pradeshas, so this paramanu, by becoming transformed by the smooth
quality fit for bondage obtained in its one pradesha, becomes the creator of the
skandhas like dvi-anu etc. Here, the paramanu which becomes separate from the
skandhas is called the karya-paramanu. And the paramanu which is the creator of
the skandhas is called the karana-paramanu. Thus, the paramanu is of two types,
due to the difference between karya and karana. As it is said:  The first karya-
paramanu is called by the destruction of the skandhas, and the second karana-
paramanu is called by the creation of the skandhas. This paramanu, being one
pradesha, is different from the skandhas which are of many pradeshas. The
skandha is called so because it is multi-pradesha due to the presence of many
paramanus in it, so it is different from the one-pradesha paramanu. Just as,
staying in one pradesha, only by the part of knowledge...

##  Translation:  **228**  Just as the omniscient Lord knows the time-like
behavior of the present moment and its infinite number, so too does a single
atom, being one-regioned, traverse the next time-atom from the previous one with
slow motion, and is capable of distinguishing the subtle time-like behavior of
the present moment and its number. Number is of four types: substance, space,
time, and emotion, and each of these is further divided into two types: gross
and subtle. A single atom is the gross number of substance. An infinite number
of atoms together form the subtle number of substance. A single region is the
gross number of space. An infinite number of regions together form the subtle
number of space. A single moment is the gross number of time-like behavior. An
infinite number of moments together form the subtle number of time-like
behavior. The subtle power of qualities like color, etc., in an atomic substance
is the gross number of emotion. The most subtle power of qualities like color,
etc., in the same atomic substance is the subtle number of emotion. In this way,
it is important to know the gross and subtle numbers of substance, space, time,
and emotion. || 8 ||  In this way, taking a single region of atomic substance as
the basis, the statement of time, etc., time-like behavior, is primarily called
a single number, and in another place, four verses are spoken.  **Atomic
Substance**  This is the description of the permutation of qualities in atomic
substance. Know that atom, which is one-flavored, one-colored, one-scented, two-
touched, the cause of sound, and soundless, and which has changed its skandha.
|| 81 ||  Know that atom, which is one-flavored, one-colored, one-scented, two-
touched, the cause of sound, and soundless, and which has changed its skandha.
|| 81 ||  In all atoms, flavor, color, scent, and touch are qualities that
coexist. These qualities are in a state of continuous permutation. For example,
at any given time, one of the five flavor permutations is present. At any given
time, one of the five color permutations is present. At any given time, one of
the two scent permutations is present. At any given time, one of the four touch
permutations (cold-smooth, cold-rough, hot-smooth, hot-rough) is present. Thus,
this atom, due to its nature of being the power of sound skandha transformation,
is the cause of sound. Due to its one-regioned nature and the absence of sound
permutation transformation, it is soundless. Due to the fact that it has changed
its skandha due to the permutation of smooth and rough, it is still one
substance, as it does not abandon its nature and has acquired the number due to
its inherent nature. || 81 ||  **Anvayaartha (That atom)** That atom [one-
flavored, one-colored, one-scented] is one-flavored, one-colored, one-scented,
and [two-touched] two-touched, [the cause of sound] the cause of sound,
[soundless]

Know that the **Panchaastikaya** (five-fold substance) is **ashब्द** (non-sound)
and **(स्कंधांतरितं)** within the **skandha** (aggregate), yet **(द्रव्यं)**
definitely a single substance.  **Commentary:** This is a statement about the
presence of qualities and their variations in atomic substance.  All atoms have
the qualities of taste, color, smell, and touch as inherent properties, and
these qualities exist in them along with their respective variations in a
sequential manner. It is as follows:  - Out of the five taste variations, one
taste exists at a time along with one variation. - Out of the five color
variations, one color exists at a time along with one variation. - Out of the
two smell variations, one smell exists at a time along with one variation. - Out
of the four pairs of touch variations (cold-smooth, cold-rough, hot-smooth, and
hot-rough), one pair of touch exists at a time.  Thus, this atom, which is said
to have the presence of qualities, is the cause of sound due to its nature as
the potential to transform into the form of the sound aggregate. It is
**ashब्द** (non-sound) due to its single-location nature and the absence of the
activity of transforming into the sound variation. It is within the **skandha**
(aggregate) due to its binding nature caused by its smooth-roughness, and yet it
is a single substance due to its attainment of individuality (i.e., being
counted separately like a complete one) while leaving behind its nature.

## 230 **Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas - with Anvaya and
General Meaning (Air, Sound, Smell, Two Touches)**  In which there is one taste,
one color, one smell, and two touches (Saddakarana) which are the cause of sound
(Asai) which is itself devoid of sound (Khandantarit) which is separate from the
skandha (Tan Davvam) that is the essence (Paramanu, Paramanu Biyane) we know.
**Specific Meaning:**  In the atom, there is one taste from among the five
tastes: pungent, bitter, astringent, sour, and sweet, which exists at one time.
One color from among the five colors: white, yellow, red, black, and blue,
exists at one time. One smell from among the two types of smells: fragrance and
stench, exists at one time. One touch from among the two touches: cold and hot,
and one touch from among the two touches: oily and rough, exist at one time.
Just as the soul, through its actions, is the cause of sound through the
activities of its tongue, lips, etc., but is the object of pure knowledge, being
the object of extra-sensory perception, not the object of sound, and is not
itself in the form of sound or other pudgala categories, therefore it is devoid
of sound. Similarly, the atom, being the cause of sound, is also devoid of sound
because it is localized and does not manifest sound. And the atom, which is the
essence, is different from the skandha, which is composed of the above-mentioned
qualities like color, etc., and categories like sound, etc. Know it to be like
the Supreme Soul. Just as the Supreme Soul, in practice, exists within the
substance, karma, and the action of karma, but in reality, is only pure
consciousness, one in nature, so too the atom, in practice, exists within the
skandhas, but in reality, is pure essence, separate from the skandhas. Or, the
meaning of "skandantarit" is that it is different from the skandha from the very
beginning.  **81**  In this way, the atom is the essence, and its qualities like
color, etc., are its nature, and from it arise categories like sound, etc. Thus,
the fifth verse is complete. In another place, five verses are spoken about the
essence of the atom.  **Conclusion of the Variations of All Pudgala**  **82**
**Uva Bhojja - Mind, Senses, Body, and Karma**  Whatever is tangible, other than
the senses, body, mind, and karma, know that all is pudgala.  **82**

The five sense objects, touch, taste, smell, color, and sound, are the middle
sense organs. The sense organs are touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing. The
bodies are the noble, the subtle, the food, the luminous, and the karmic. The
substance-mind, the substance-karma, and the non-karma are the infinite,
infinite-atom-groups, infinite-innumerable-atom-groups, infinite-numerable-atom-
groups, extending to the bow-shoulder, and the atoms. Whatever else is material,
all that should be understood as a variety of pudgala. || 82 || - Thus ends the
explanation of the pudgala-substance-body. Anvaya-artha (Indriyah upbhogyam cha)
The object of enjoyment by the senses, [Indriyakayah] the sense body, (Man) mind
(Karmani) karma (cha) (anyat yat) whatever else (murta bhavati) is material (tat
sarvam) all that (pudgalam janiyat) know as pudgala. Tika - This is the
conclusion of all the varieties of pudgala. Touch, taste, smell, color, and
sound (five) sense objects, touch, taste, breath, sight, and hearing (five)
substance-senses, noble, subtle, food, luminous, and karmic (five) bodies,
substance-mind, substance-karma, non-karma, the infinite, infinite-atom-groups,
infinite-innumerable-atom-groups, and infinite-numerable-atom-groups extending
to the two-atom-shoulder, and the atoms, and whatever else is material, all that
should be understood as a variety of pudgala. Thus ends the explanation of the
pudgala-substance-body. San.ta. - Now, let us summarize all the varieties of
pudgala. The object of enjoyment by the senses - The object of enjoyment of
those beings who are free from attachment, who have no taste for sensual
pleasures, is the form of the five sense objects. The sense bodies are the
opposite of the non-sensory nature of the non-sensory self. The five bodies,
called the noble, the subtle, the food, the luminous, and the karmic, are the
opposite of the non-body nature of the non-body self. The mind is the opposite
of the pure being-body, which is free from the network of mental constructs. The
eight karmas are the opposite of the substance-self, which is free from karmic
actions. Whatever is material, which is the opposite of the immortal nature of
the immortal self, is the form of infinite-innumerable-infinite-atom-groups, the
form of an infinite-divisible-atom-mass. All that, and everything else, such as
non-karma, etc., is pudgala. Thus ends the summary of the pudgala-substance. ||
82 || Thus, in the form of a summary of the pudgala-body, one verse has been
included in the third place. Thus ends the fifth chapter, called the pudgala-
body, in the first great chapter, which deals with the six substances, the five
bodies, and the ten verses. || Him.ta. - Uththānika - Further, summarizing all
the varieties of pudgala, they say - Anvaya-sahita samanyārtha - (Indiehiṁ

Know all of this as **pudgala** dravya: the six substances, the five astikayas,
the five senses (**indriya**), the five types of bodies (**kaya**), the mind
(**mano**), the eight karmas (**kammani**), and anything else that is a material
substance (**murtika padartha**).  **Special Meaning:**  Know as **pudgala** the
five sense objects that are enjoyed by those beings who do not have the taste of
the **vitaraaga** (free from attachment) and **ati-indriya** (beyond the senses)
bliss, the five senses that are opposite to the **ati-indriya** (beyond the
senses) self-nature, the five bodies (**audarika**, **vaikriyika**,
**aaharaka**, **taijas**, and **karman**), which are opposite to the bodiless
self-substance, the mind that is different from the pure **jiva-astikaya**
(soul-body) devoid of mental fluctuations, the eight karmas (**jnana-avaran**
etc.) that are contrary to the karma-free self-substance, and anything else that
is a material substance (**murtika**), such as the **skandha** (aggregate) of
countable, uncountable, and infinite **pudgala** atoms, which are opposite to
the immaterial self-nature. || 82 ||  Thus, in the third **sthala** (stage), one
**gatha** (verse) was spoken, contracting the **pudgala-astikaya**. In this way,
the fifth **antar-adhikāra** (inner chapter) named **pudgala-astikaya** ended in
the first **maha-adhikāra** (great chapter) in ten **gatha** (verses), which are
the proponents of the six substances and the five **astikayas**.

## The Nature of Dharma-astikaaya  This is a description of the nature of
Dharma-astikaaya.  Dharma-astikaaya is without taste, color, smell, sound, or
touch. It pervades all realms, is unbreakable, vast, and encompasses countless
regions.  **Commentary:**  Dharma-astikaaya is inherently formless due to the
complete absence of touch, taste, smell, and color. Therefore, it is also
soundless. It pervades all realms and space, making it all-encompassing. It is
unbreakable because it is composed of countless, inseparable regions. It is vast
because it is inherently expansive in all directions. Although it is a single,
unbroken entity in its essence, it is considered to encompass countless regions
in practical terms.  **Further Explanation:**  This section discusses the nature
of Dharma-astikaaya and Adharma-astikaaya. The seven verses in this section
focus on these two concepts. The first three verses primarily describe the
nature of Dharma-astikaaya, beginning with the phrase "Dhamm-atthikaaya-
marasam." The following verse, starting with "Jah havaddi," focuses on the
nature of Adharma-astikaaya. The final three verses, beginning with "Jado alog,"
discuss the merits and demerits of both Dharma-astikaaya and Adharma-astikaaya,
emphasizing their existence and non-existence. These seven verses collectively
explain the nature of Dharma-astikaaya and Adharma-astikaaya, providing a
comprehensive understanding of these concepts.  **In summary:**  The first verse
describes Dharma-astikaaya as being devoid of taste, color, smell, sound, and
touch. It is all-encompassing, unbreakable, vast, and encompasses countless
regions. The commentary further elaborates on these characteristics, explaining
the inherent formlessness, soundlessness, pervasiveness, unbreakable nature, and
vastness of Dharma-astikaaya.

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  **In the regions of
transformed living beings, the Dharma-astikaya is like the supreme bliss, the
taste of nectar, the perfect harmony, and the pervading presence of the Siddhas
in the Siddha-kshetra, like water in a full pot, or like oil in sesame seeds. It
is continuous, without any gaps between regions, and it is not scattered like a
group of meditating monks in a deserted forest or like a crowd of people in a
city. It is vast and boundless like the sky in the regions of the Abhyavi-jiva,
and it is not limited like the regions of the Kevali-jiva, which are like the
expanse of cloth or other objects.  **  **Furthermore, what is its special
characteristic? The Sutra states that it is a single, undivided region, but due
to its nature, it is considered to be as vast as the number of regions in the
Lokakasha, as indicated by the term "Asankhya" (innumerable).**

The five-fold substance is pervasive in the world, like clothes and other things
that expand and contract. It is not expanding now, but it has been pervasive
from the beginning of time and will continue to be so for an infinite time. It
is a group of infinite substances, but according to the principle of good
conduct, it is the measure of the space of the world. This is the meaning of the
sutra. ||83|| This is a description of the remaining nature of Dharma. Always,
by the infinite, heavy and light, it is transformed. It is the cause of the
motion and action of the substances, and it is itself without action. ||84|| The
Dharma is always transformed by the infinite, heavy and light qualities, which
are the basis of its nature, and which are constantly changing in the six
places. It is constantly being created and destroyed, but it does not change its
nature, so it is eternal. It is the cause of the motion and action of the
substances, because it is the only support that is not separate from them. It is
itself without action, because it is only the existence of itself. ||84||
Another meaning: (By the infinite, heavy and light) it (the Dharma substance) is
always transformed by the infinite, heavy and light (qualities, parts), it is
eternal. It is the cause of the motion and action of the substances, and it is
itself without action. Commentary: This is a statement of the remaining nature
of Dharma. Again, Dharma [Dharma substance] is transformed by the heavy and
light qualities, that is, the nature of the heavy and light, which is the basis
of its nature, and which is constantly changing in the six places. It is
constantly being created and destroyed, but it does not change its nature, so it
is eternal. It is the cause of the motion and action of the substances, because
it is the only support that is not separate from them. It is itself without
action, because it is only the existence of itself. ||84||  _Saṃ. Tā. Athā

The description of the six substances and the five astikayas is as follows:  The
Lord, the Siddha, though indifferent, is a contributing cause for the attainment
of Siddhahood by the worthy beings who are absorbed in the qualities of the
Siddhas. Similarly, Dharma, though indifferent by nature, is a contributing
cause for the movement of the living beings and pudgalas who are undergoing
transformation.  First, it is not an effect, just as the Siddha is not an
effect, because he is not created by anyone else, but is self-existent.
Similarly, Dharma is not an effect because it is self-existent. This is the
meaning.  The remaining nature of the Dharma substance is as follows:  It is
constantly changing due to the infinite, subtle and gross qualities. It is
imperishable and is the cause of the movement of the living beings and pudgalas
who are associated with the action of movement. It is not an effect in itself.
**Special Meaning:**  Due to the nature of the substance, there are subtle and
gross qualities. These constantly change through the infinite, indivisible, and
limited divisions of the six locations, which are the states of existence,
growth, and decay. Through the perspective of the Paryayaarthika Nay, this
Dharma substance is subject to production and destruction, but through the
perspective of the Dravyarthika Nay, it is eternal.  Just as the Lord, the
Siddha, is indifferent, but is a contributing cause for the attainment of
Siddhahood by the worthy beings who are absorbed in the qualities of the
Siddhas, similarly, this Dharma substance is indifferent to the living beings
and pudgalas who are moving, but is a contributing cause for their movement.
Just as the Lord, the Siddha, is created by his own pure existence and is not
created by anyone else, therefore he is not an effect, similarly, the Dharma
substance is also created by its own existence and is not created by anyone
else, therefore it is not an effect. This is the meaning.  **Example:**  Just as
water is a contributing cause for the movement of fish in the world, similarly,
know that the Dharma substance is a contributing cause for the movement of
living beings and pudgalas.  Just as water, though not moving itself, is a
contributing cause for the movement of fish who are moving themselves,
similarly, Dharma, though not moving itself, is a contributing cause for the
movement of living beings and pudgalas who are moving themselves.

**Verse 237**  **Anvaya:** Just as water in the world is helpful for the
movement of fish, in the same way, know that Dharma-dravya is helpful for the
movement of jivas and pudgalas.  **Tika:** This is an illustration of Dharma
being the cause of motion.  Just as water, not moving itself and not causing
others to move, is a mere supportive cause, being indifferent and inseparable,
for the movement of fish that move on their own, in the same way, Dharma
(Dharma-astikaya) also, not moving itself and not causing others to move, is a
mere supportive cause, being indifferent and inseparable, for the movement of
jivas and pudgalas that move on their own. ||85||  **Samskrita Tika:** Now, the
author presents a well-known illustration of Dharma being the cause of motion:
Just as water in the world is helpful for the movement of fish, in the same way,
know that Dharma-dravya is helpful for the movement of jivas and pudgalas, O
disciple. For example, just as water, not moving itself and not impelling the
fish, is a supportive cause for the movement of those fish that move on their
own, in the same way, Dharma, not moving itself and not impelling others, is a
supportive cause for the movement of jivas and pudgalas that move on their own.
Or, for the movement of the liberated souls. For example, just as the pure,
self-realized, doubt-free Dharma, free from the defects of attachment, etc., is
the material cause for the liberation of the blessed ones, in the same way, the
Dharma in the form of merit, characterized by the excellent accumulation of the
nature of Tirthankaras, obtained through the cessation of causes, is also a
supportive cause. Similarly, although jivas and pudgalas have their own material
cause for their movement, Dharma-astikaya is also a supportive cause. Or, for
the movement of the blessed and the unblessed ones: Just as, during the time of
movement in the four states of existence, although the internal good and bad
karmic results are the material cause, external good practices like giving,
worship, etc., and external auspicious observances are also supportive causes,
in the same way, although jivas and pudgalas have their own internal strength
through their own conviction, Dharma-astikaya is also a cause of movement in
practice. This is the meaning. ||85||  Thus, the first three verses have
primarily explained Dharma-astikaya.

## Translation:  **238**  While discussing the six substances and the five
categories of matter, the movement of the soul and the pudgalas becomes a
cooperative cause. This is similar to how punya is a cooperative cause in the
attainment of the Siddha state by the liberated souls. Although the knowledge of
the true self, free from passions and with pure self-experience, is the
substantial cause for the liberated souls to attain the Siddha state, the karma
of the Tirthankara nature, bound by the results without a cause, and the special
punya in the form of the karma of superior endurance, etc., or the auspicious
dharma, is the cooperative cause.   Similarly, although the inner auspicious or
inauspicious result is the substantial cause for the movement of the four states
for both the liberated and the non-liberated souls, the act of wearing the
symbols of the substance, etc., and giving donations, performing worship, etc.,
or other external auspicious rituals are the external cooperative causes.   In
the same way, although the soul and the pudgalas have their own inherent power
within them, the dharma-astikaya is the cooperative cause for their movement in
practice. This is the meaning. || 85 ||  In this way, three verses were spoken
primarily about the explanation of the dharma-astikaya in the first section.
This is the explanation of the nature of adharma.  **86**  Just as there is
dharma-dravya, so know that there is also a substance called adharma. It is the
cause for those who are engaged in the activity of staying, like the earth. ||
86 ||  Just as dharma has been explained, so too should adharma be explained.
However, there is a difference. It (dharma-astikaya) is the cause for those who
are engaged in the activity of movement, like water. This one, however, is the
cause for those who are engaged in the activity of staying, like the earth. Just
as the earth itself stands firm and establishes others, and is only a supporting
cause for the staying of horses, etc., so too adharma itself stands firm and
establishes others, and is only a supporting cause for the staying of the soul
and the pudgalas. || 86 ||  **Meaning:** Just as there is dharma-dravya, so too
know that there is also a substance called adharma. However, it is the cause for
those who are engaged in the activity of staying, like the earth.
**Commentary:** This is the statement of the nature of adharma.  Just as dharma
has been explained, so too should adharma be explained. However, there is a
difference. It (dharma-astikaya) is the cause for those who are engaged in the
activity of movement, like water. This one, however, is the cause for those who
are engaged in the activity of staying, like the earth. Just as the earth itself
stands firm and establishes others, and is only a supporting cause for the
staying of horses, etc., so too adharma itself stands firm and establishes
others, and is only a supporting cause for the staying of the soul and the
pudgalas. || 86 ||

The five-fold astikaya is the cause of 239 types of karma, and this (adharma-
astikaya) is the cause of the earth's stability for those who are engaged in
karmic activity. Just as the earth, being itself stable and not causing the
stability of others, is a mere supporting cause, indifferent and inseparable,
for the stability of horses and other beings that are naturally stable, so too
[adharma-astikaya], being itself stable and not causing the stability of others,
is a mere supporting cause, indifferent and inseparable, for the stability of
those who are naturally stable. || 86 ||

The knowledge of the six substances and the five astikayas is described.
According to the vyavahar nay, the reason for this is the remembrance of the
qualities of the five supreme beings, such as aham, siddha, etc. Similarly,
according to the nischya nay, the nature of the jivas and pudgalas is the
material cause for their existence. This is the meaning of the sutra, "Adharma
is a substance." ||86||  In this way, the explanation of the adharma substance
ends in the second part of the gatha sutra. This is a discussion of the cause of
the harmony of dharma and adharma. Just as the movement and rest of the alog and
log are due to their nature, so too are the two divided and undivided, and the
world and the non-world. ||87||  The movement and rest of the alog and log are
due to the harmony of the two. ||8|| The two are both divided and undivided, and
they are also the measure of the world. ||8|| Dharma and adharma exist because
the division of the world and the non-world cannot be otherwise. The world is
the existence of all substances, including jivas, etc., in one place. The non-
world is the existence of pure space. There, jivas and pudgalas obtain their
movement and rest from their own nature. If dharma and adharma were not the
external causes of the movement and rest of jivas and pudgalas, which they
themselves experience, then their movement and rest would be without any cause,
and they would also exist in the non-world. Then the division of the world and
the non-world would not be established. Therefore, the harmony of dharma and
adharma is accepted as the external cause of the movement and rest of jivas and
pudgalas. ||87||  Commentary: This shows the reason for the establishment of the
harmony of dharma and adharma.  Dharma and adharma exist because the division of
the world and the non-world cannot be otherwise. The world is the existence of
all substances, including jivas, etc., in one place. The non-world is the
existence of pure space. There, jivas and pudgalas obtain their movement and
rest from their own nature. If dharma and adharma were not the external causes
of the movement and rest of jivas and pudgalas, which they themselves
experience, then their movement and rest would be without any cause, and they
would also exist in the non-world. Then the division of the world and the non-
world would not be established. Therefore, the harmony of dharma and adharma is
accepted as the external cause of the movement and rest of jivas and pudgalas.
||87||  Anvayaartha: (Gamanasthiti) (Jiva-pudgalaki) movement and rest (cha) and
(alokalokam) the division of the alog and log (yayoh sadbhavatas) due to the
harmony of those two substances (jatam) happens. (Cha) and (dvaun api) these two
(vibhaktou) divided, (avibhaktou) undivided (cha) and (lokamaatraun) the measure
of the world (matoun) are said.  Commentary: This shows the reason for the
establishment of the harmony of dharma and adharma.

**From the five astikayas and onwards,**  **241. By what can one be saved from
(nothing can save one from it), therefore the division of the world and the non-
world will not be proven, but if the movement of the jiva and pudgala and their
stationary state are accepted as the external causes of dharma and adharma, then
the division of the world and the non-world (is proven). (Therefore dharma and
adharma exist.) Dharma and adharma are both distinct from each other due to
their separate existence, and are inseparable due to their being in the same
field, and they influence the jivas and pudgalas in the entire world in their
movement and stationary state in a passive way, therefore they are proof of the
world.**  **Commentary:**  **The text shows the reason for the existence of
dharma and adharma. What is the cause? The world and the non-world. From what is
it born? From the possibility of dharma and adharma, which are naturally
inherent. Not only the world and the non-world are born, but also the movement
and stationary state of the jivas and pudgalas. How are they? Both dharma and
adharma are accepted as two distinct entities, or according to another reading,
"amya" (not created by anyone). They are distinct due to their separate
existence, and inseparable due to their being in the same field, and they are
proof of the world and the non-world.**  **Explanation:**  **The world is a
collection of six substances, and the non-world is the pure space outside of it.
The existence of the world and the non-world proves the existence of dharma and
adharma. If there were no external causes of dharma and adharma in the movement
and stationary state of the jivas and pudgalas in the world, then how would
movement be prohibited in the outer part of the world? Nothing can prohibit it,
therefore the division of the world and the non-world proves the existence of
dharma and adharma. What are their characteristics? They are distinct due to
their separate existence, and inseparable due to their being in the same field.
They are always passive and pervading the entire world, therefore they are proof
of the world.**

## 242 ## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  Who can
prohibit? If there were no one to prohibit, then there would be no division of
the world and the non-world. But when there is a world and a non-world, then it
is known that Dharma and Adharma are definitely substances. Their existence is
distinct, they are certainly connected. Both are immersed in the same field,
just as the Siddha-Rashi is inseparable from the field in which it resides, so
are they inseparable. Both are always inactive and, being all-pervasive, are
limited to the world - this is the meaning of the sutra. ||87||  This explains
the complete indifference of Dharma and Adharma, even though they are the cause
of motion and rest.  The Nay (principle) moves, Dharma does not move, it does
not move another substance.  The spread of motion is for the Jivas and the
Puggalas. ||88||  Just as the wind, which is the result of motion, is seen to be
the cause of the motion of flags, so Dharma is not. Because it is inactive, it
never becomes the result of motion. How then can it be the cause of the motion
of others by being a co-worker? But just as water is only a supporting cause for
fish, so is Dharma indifferent to the spread of motion for Jivas and Puggalas.
And just as a horse, which is the result of motion and previous rest, is seen to
be the cause of the rest of the chariot, so Adharma is not. Because it is
inactive, it never becomes the result of motion and previous rest. How then can
it be the cause of the rest of others? But just as the earth is only a
supporting cause for the horse, so is Adharma indifferent to the spread of
motion and previous rest for Jivas and Puggalas. ||88||  Meaning of the Anvaya:
(Dharma-Astika) Dharma-Astika (na gachchati) does not move (cha) and
(anyadravya-sya) does not cause the movement of another substance, (sa) he
(jiva-na-m puggala-na-m) (of the Jivas and Puggalas) (gateh prasara) is the
spreader of motion (bhavati) becomes.  Commentary: Here it is stated that Dharma
and Adharma are completely indifferent, even though they are the cause of motion
and rest.  Just as the wind, which is the result of motion, is seen to be the
cause of the motion of flags, so Dharma is not. Because it is inactive, it never
becomes the result of motion, so how can it be the cause of the motion of others
by being a co-worker? (It cannot be.) But just as water is only a supporting
cause for fish (in motion), so is Dharma indifferent to the spread of motion for
Jivas and Puggalas.

The **Pancastikaya** is the propagator of the **Udasina** motion, just as the
**Dharma** is the propagator of the **Udasina** motion of the **Jiva** and
**Pudgala** (in the **Gatiparinam**), only as a supporting cause.  And (in
relation to **Adharmaastikaya** also, it is like this that) just as a horse,
whose **Gati** is **Purvakasthitiparinat**, appears to be the cause of the
**Sthitiparinam** of the rider (**Patipurvak**), so **Adharma** is not. It
(**Adharma**) being truly inactive, never attains **Gatipurvakasthitiparinam**,
so how can it be the cause of the **Gatipurvakasthitiparinam** of others by
being co-existent? (It cannot be) But just as the earth is the propagator of the
**Udasina** motion of the **Gatipurvakasthiti** only as a supporting cause for
the horse (in **Gatipurvakasthitiparinam**), in the same way, **Adharma** is the
propagator of the **Udasina** motion of the **Gatipurvakasthiti** only as a
supporting cause for the **Jiva-Pudgala** in **Purvakapasadharana**. || 88 ||

##  Translation:  **244**  The description of the six-fold *astikaya* and the
five-fold *astikaya* has been given. In the same way, the *dharma* substance,
being self-established, moves due to its own inherent cause, and becomes an
external cause for the movement of the *jiva* and *pudgala* without any
motivation. Although the *dharma-astikaya* is indifferent, it is a cause for the
movement of the *jiva* and *pudgala*. Just as water is indifferent, yet it is
helpful in the movement of fish due to their own inherent force. Just as the
earth is helpful for the horses that are self-established, and the shade is
helpful for the travelers, in the same way, the *adharma-astikaya* is self-
established, yet it is an external cause for the state of the *jiva* and
*pudgala* due to its own inherent cause. This is the opinion of Bhagwan Shri
Kundakunda Acharya Dev. || 88 ||  This is a discussion about the indifference of
*dharma* and *adharma* as causes. Those who have movement, their state of being
is also possible. They make movement and state of being through their own
transformations. || 89 ||  *Dharma* never acts as a cause for the movement of
*jiva* and *pudgala*, and *adharma* never acts as a cause for their state of
being. If they were the main causes (motivating causes) for the movement and
state of being of others, then those who have movement should only have movement
and not state of being, and those who have state of being should only have state
of being and not movement. But since we see both movement and state of being in
the same entity, it can be inferred that they are not the main causes. However,
they are indifferent as established by the practical approach. How then do the
entities that have movement and state of being have movement and state of being?
All entities that have movement and state of being definitely make movement and
state of being through their own transformations. || 89 ||  Thus ends the
explanation of the *dharma* and *adharma* substances and their *astikaya*.
**Anvaya-artha:** (Those who have movement) those who have movement (their state
of being is also possible) then they have state of being [and those who have
state of being, they have movement]. (They) those (entities that have movement
and state of being) then (through their own transformations) through their own
transformations (make movement and state of being) make movement and state of
being.  **Tika:** This is said regarding the indifference of *dharma* and
*adharma* as causes.  In reality, *dharma* never acts as a cause for the
movement of *jiva* and *pudgala*, and *adharma* never acts as a cause for their
state of being. Because if they were the main causes (motivating causes) for the
movement and state of being of others, then those who have movement should only
have movement and not state of being, and those who have state of being should
only have state of being and not movement. But the same entity (the same entity)
has both movement and state of being.

The five Astikayas are seen in 245 ways, therefore it can be inferred that they
[Dharma-Adharma] are not the main causes of motion and rest, but are established
by practical means! (established-said by practical means) indifferent cause
Question- If this is the case, how do the substances that are in motion and rest
come to be in motion and rest? Answer- In reality, all substances that are in
motion and rest are definitely in motion and rest due to their own

## Translation:  **246**  The description of the six substances and the five
aggregates is presented, but it is observed that those who move are the ones who
stay, or those who are stationary are the ones who move. This proves that dharma
and adharma are not the primary causes. If they are not the primary causes, then
how do the jivas and the karmic particles move and stay? Therefore, it is said
that they move or stay by their own inherent powers of transformation. Here, the
intention is that the unchanging, blissful, and luminous nature, which is the
essence of the Supreme Soul, is the object of attainment. These dharma and
adharma substances are different from that pure soul essence, therefore they are
the objects of renunciation. || 89 ||  In this way, the establishment of dharma
and adharma substances is primarily mentioned in the third section, in the three
verses. In these seven verses, through the three sections, the sixth chapter,
which explains dharma and adharma, is completed in the middle of the first great
chapter, which deals with the five aggregates and the six substances.  **The
nature of the space substance is explained as follows:**  "All jivas, all other
substances, and all karmic particles, whatever gives space to all, that is
called space in the world." || 90 ||  In the world, which is made up of six
substances, the pure space, which is the cause of all space for all other
substances, is called space. || 9 ||  Now, the explanation of the space
substance is given.  **Explanation:**  (In the world) in the world, (of jivas)
of jivas, (and) and [of karmic particles] of karmic particles, (as well) in the
same way, (of all other substances) of all other substances, (whatever) that
which (gives all space) gives all space, (that) that [is space] is space.
**Commentary:**  This is the statement of the nature of space. In the world,
which is made up of the earth substance, the space that is the cause of all
space for all other substances is space, which is the pure space. || 10 ||
**Summary:**  After the pure soul aggregate, which is the cause of liberation,
the nature of pure consciousness and the object of attainment, the space
aggregate is explained in seven verses. In these seven verses, first, the nature
of the world and space is explained in the verse beginning with "All jivas..."
Then, the question is raised, "What is the purpose of dharma and adharma if
space itself will cause movement and stillness?" This is the main point of the
four verses beginning with "Space is perceived..." Then, the fact that dharma,
adharma, the world, and space are all one field is explained...

## Translation:  **Pancastikaya Prabhruta**  247  The main point of the sutra
"Dhamma Dhamma Agasa" etc. is that due to the pervasiveness and equal measure of
the five categories, they are one in terms of non-real existence, but due to
their distinct characteristics, they are different in terms of certainty. Thus,
the seven gathas explain the nature of the Akasa Stikaya in three places.
**Explanation:**  The nature of Akasa is described as follows:  "It encompasses
all beings, all souls, all other things, all Dharmas, Adharmas, and Kalas, and
all Pudgalas. It is the space that gives space. It is the void, the gap, the
opening, the expanse, the whole, the entire, the aforementioned, the world. It
is the Akasa."  **Question:**  Here, Shiva Kumar Maharaj asks, "O Bhagavan! This
world is of immeasurable extent. In this world, there are countless beings, each
with infinite qualities, and there are also infinite Pudgalas, Dharmas,
Adharmas, and Kalas. How do they all find space in this Akasa?"  **Answer:**
The Bhagavan replies, "Just as many lamps illuminate a single room, just as many
gold coins are contained in a single bag, just as many things are kept in a
single house, and just as many sounds are heard from a single bell, so too, in
this world of immeasurable extent, countless beings find space due to the unique
quality of pervasiveness." || 10 ||  **Hindi Translation:**  **Uththānikā:**
After this, the pure and enlightened soul is the pure Jiva Stikaya, which is the
cause of liberation and is capable of receiving everything. The Akasa Stikaya,
which is different from it, is described in seven gathas. Among these seven
gathas, the first two describe the nature of both Lokakasa and Alokakasa,
starting with the gatha "Savvesim Jivaṇam" etc. Further, Akasa itself will be
both in motion and at rest. What is the need for Dharma and Adharma substances?
To refute this prior objection, the next four gathas are in the order of "Agasam
Avagasam" etc. Then, Dharma, Adharma, and Lokakasa are considered as one field
of pervasiveness, and being of equal measure, they are one in terms of non-real
existence, but due to their distinct characteristics, they are different in
terms of certainty. This is stated in the sutra "Dhamma Dhamma Agasa" etc. In
this way, the seven gathas explain the nature of the Akasa Stikaya in three
places.  **Hindi Translation:**  **Now, the nature of Akasa is described:**
**Anvayasahita Samanyarthah:**  (Savvesim) All (Jivaṇam) beings (tay ya) and
(Poggalāṇam) Pudgalas (cha) and (Sesāṇam) the rest, Dharma, Adharma, and Kala
(jan) which (vivaram) space (dedi) gives (tan) that (akhilam) entire (ayasam)
Akasa (loe) in this world (havdi) is.  **Vishesharth:**  Here, Shiva Kumar
Maharaj said, "O Bhagavan! This world is immeasurable...

248 Description of the Six Substances - Five Astikayas It is in the region. In
this world, there are infinite and infinite living beings who are eternally free
from karma-born knowledge and are characterized by supreme bliss. They are even
more infinite in their qualities. How do all these, with their different
measures of space in the world-space, find space in this world-space? Bhagwan
Kundkund Maharaj answers: Just as the light of many lamps finds space in one
room, and a lot of gold in a single piece of fragrant betel nut, and a pot full
of honey in a pot full of camel's milk, and the sound of victory and the sound
of a bell, etc., find space in a cellar due to the special quality of
penetration, so too, countless beings, etc., can find space in countless
regional worlds. || 90 ||  **Indication of Space Outside the World**  Living
beings, matter, body, dharma, and adharma are not different from the world.
Space, which is without end, is different from and not different from the world.
|| 91 ||  Living beings, etc., are not different from the world because they are
limited in size, while space, because it is infinite, is different from and not
different from the world. || 91 ||  **Anvayaartha** [Living beings, matter-body,
dharma, adharma, and time] are not different from the world. Space, which is
without end, is different from and not different from the world.  **Commentary**
1- This is an indication of space outside the world.  The remaining substances
(other than space) are limited in size and are therefore not different from the
world. Space, however, is infinite and is therefore different from and not
different from the world. || 91 ||  **San. Ta.** - Now, the text reveals that
the world is a combination of the six substances, and that there is infinite
space outside it. Living beings, matter-body, dharma, adharma, and time are all
included in the world. How are they all included? They are not different from
the world. Space, which is different from and not different from the world-
space, is infinite. What is the proof of this? It is without end. Although the
text generally states that these substances are not different from the world, it
is certain that living beings are different from the other substances due to
their characteristics of being formless, having only knowledge, being naturally
endowed with supreme bliss, being eternal, and being free from impurities. The
other substances are also different from living beings due to their own
characteristics. Therefore, it is understood that there is no possibility of
mixing or interference. || 11 ||  Thus, the first two verses have established
the nature of the world and space outside the world.

## Pancastikaya Prabhrit 249  **Hindi Ta. - Uththānika -** Further it is said
that the aggregate of six substances is the Lok (world), beyond that is the
infinite Akash (space) which is Alok (non-world).  **Anvaya Saha Samanyarth -**
(Jiva) Infinite Jivas (Poggalakaya) infinite Pul Skandha and Anu (Dhamma Dhamma)
Dharma Adharma dravya (Y) and innumerable Kal dravya (Logdo) are not outside
this Lok (world). (Tatto) That which is not separate from this Lok Akash
(Annyaan) is the remaining (Annan) Akash (Ayasam) which is infinite and devoid
of any (Antavadirittam).  **Vishesharth -** In this Sutra, the oneness of
substances with Lok Akash is stated in general, however, it is certain that all
Jivas who are formless, possess only knowledge, are naturally blissful, eternal
and free from the stain of Karma, are different from the remaining substances
due to their characteristics. Similarly, the remaining substances are also
different from Jivas due to their own characteristics. Therefore, it is known
that even though they reside in the same space, there is no mixing or
interference, meaning no substance merges with another to become one, nor does
any substance disperse to become many. || 99 ||  In this way, supporting the
nature of both Lok Akash and Alok Akash, two verses were spoken in the first
section.  **Akashya Avakashaikaheto Gartisthitihetuthvashankayaam
Doshopannyaso'yam**  **Aagasam Avagasam Gaman-Hidi- Karanehim Deddi Jadi.**
**Uddum Gadi - Ppradhana Siddha Chitthati Kidh Tatth.** || 92 ||  **Aakasham

(Gamanasthitikaranaabhyam) gives space with the cause of motion and rest
[Avakasham Dadati] (meaning if Akash is both the cause of space and the cause of
motion and rest), then (Urdhvagatipradhanaah Siddhaah) the Siddhas who are
primarily of upward motion (Tatrah) in that (Akash) (Katham) why [Tishtanti]
remain stationary? (Why don't they move further?)

250 **Commentary on the Five-fold Nature of Substance** - If someone claims that
space is the cause of motionlessness, and doubts that space is also the cause of
motion, then there is a flaw in their argument.  If space, in the same way that
it is the cause of the movement of those who move, is also the cause of the
motionlessness of those who are motionless, then why (for what reason) would the
perfected, liberated beings, who are naturally inclined to move upwards, remain
stationary in space, even though they have the external and internal means and
materials? ||92||  **Commentary** - Here, it is shown that if space provides
space for beings like jivas, and if it also provides for motion and stillness,
then there is a flaw. The question is, if space is the cause, then why would it
provide for both? How can it be the cause of both movement and stillness?
**Explanation** - The perfected beings, who are characterized by pure
consciousness and the absence of change, have destroyed the paths of hell,
animal, human, and god, and have attained the state of liberation through the
power of their understanding of the essence of time and cause. They naturally
move upwards. Why do they remain stationary in the space at the top of the
world?  **Meaning** - This sutra implies that space is not the cause of
stillness. The perfected beings do not move beyond the world because there is no
dharma substance beyond the world. Dharma substance is the cause of movement.
||12||  This is an explanation of the position of stillness. The Jina sages have
stated that the perfected beings reside above. Therefore, space is not the cause
of stillness, but rather the cause of movement. ||93||

##  Translation:  **Verse 93:**  **From the five-pointed star and above, the
position of the Siddhas has been declared by the Jinas. Therefore, know that
there is no place of movement in the sky.**  **Commentary:**  This is a
statement regarding the position of the Siddhas. Since the Siddha Bhagavants,
having moved, reside above the world, it is certain that the cause of movement
and position is not in the sky. It is to be understood that Dharma and Adharma,
which divide the world and the non-world, are the causes of movement and
position.  **Explanation:**  This verse explains that the Siddhas, who are
beyond the realm of the world, do not move or reside in the sky. Their movement
and position are determined by Dharma and Adharma, which are the principles that
govern the universe.   **Note:** The term "five-pointed star" refers to the
five-pointed star symbol that represents the Jain cosmology.

##  252 **Explanation of the six substances and five astikayas**  This is an
explanation of the reason why space is not the cause of motion and rest. If
space were the cause of motion and the reason for their location, then the
destruction of the non-living world and the expansion of the living world would
follow.   **94** If space were the cause of motion and the reason for their
location, then the destruction of the non-living world and the expansion of the
living world would follow. Space is not the cause of motion and rest because the
arrangement of the boundaries of the living and non-living worlds can be
explained in this way. If space were considered the cause of motion and rest,
then because space exists everywhere, the motion and rest of living beings and
pudgalas would be limitless, and the non-living world would be destroyed every
moment. The boundary of the living world, which was previously established,
would be broken by the continuous expansion of the living world. Therefore,
space is not the cause of motion and rest.   **Explanation of the text:**  [If]
If (space) space (of them) living beings and pudgalas (cause of motion) is the
cause of motion and [reason for their location] the cause of rest (is) then
(destruction of the non-living world) the destruction of the non-living world
(and) and (expansion of the living world) the expansion of the living world
(would follow) would follow.  **Commentary:**  Here, the reason for the absence
of space being the cause of motion and rest is presented. Space is not the cause
of motion and rest because the arrangement of the boundaries of the living and
non-living worlds can be explained in this way. If space were considered the
cause of motion and rest, then because space exists everywhere, the motion and
rest of living beings and pudgalas would be limitless, and the non-living world
would be destroyed every moment. The boundary of the living world, which was
previously established, would be broken by the continuous expansion of the
living world. Therefore, space is not the cause of motion and rest.   **94**
_Commentary:_  Now, in order to prove that space is not the cause of motion and
rest, another reason is given: "If it were to be..." What is it? "Cause of
motion" - the cause of motion. What? "Space" - space, not only the cause of
motion? "Reason for their location" - the cause of rest. Of whom? "Them" - those
living beings and pudgalas. Then what would be the fault? "Would follow" - would
follow. What is it? "Destruction of the non-living world" - the destruction of
the non-living world, not only the destruction of the non-living world, but also
"expansion of the living world" - the expansion of the living world. For
example, if space were the cause of motion and rest, then because space exists
even outside the living world, there would also be motion of living beings and
pudgalas there, and therefore there would be destruction of the non-living world
and expansion of the living world. But that is not the case, therefore, from
this reason, it is known that space is not the cause of motion and rest. This is
the meaning.

##  Pancastikaya Prabhrut 253  **Hindi Ta-Uththānika:** Further, there are more
reasons to prove that space does not have the power to cause motion and rest.
**Anvaya Saha Samanyarth:** If space were the cause of motion and rest for the
living beings and karmic particles, then the destruction of non-loka space would
occur, and the boundary of loka space would expand.  **Vishesharth:** If space
were the cause of motion and rest, then space would exist even outside loka
space. In that case, the living beings and karmic particles would move even in
infinite space. This would lead to the non-existence of non-loka space and the
expansion of the boundary of loka space. But this is not the case. Therefore, it
is proven that space is not the cause of motion and rest. || 94 ||  **Akasha-sya

and adharma are the causes of motion and rest, not space. This is what the Jinas
have said to those who listen to the nature of the world.  **Teeka:** This is
the conclusion of the statement refuting the claim that space is the cause of
motion and rest. Dharma and adharma are the causes of motion and rest, not
space. || 95 ||  **San. Ta.:** Now, the conclusion of the explanation refuting
space as the cause of motion and rest is stated. Therefore, dharma and adharma
are the causes of motion and rest, not space. This is what the Jinas have said.
To whom does this apply? To those who are worthy. What are they doing? They are
listening to the nature of the world while seeking refuge. This is the meaning.
|| 15 ||  **Hindi Ta-Uththānika:** Thus, the four verses in the second section
have gone by, stating that dharma and adharma are the causes of motion and rest,
not space.  **Hindi Ta-Uththānika:** Further, this explanation is summarized by
saying that space is not the cause of motion and rest.

##  Chapter 254: Description of the Six Substances and Five Bodies - Including
Other Matters  **General Meaning:**  [Tahhmaa] Due to this reason, [Dhamma-
Dhamma] Dharma and Adharma are the contributing causes for [Gaman-Vidika-
Karanani] movement and rest. [Aagasam Na] Space is not a cause. [Idi] This is
what [Sunantanam] the noble ones who listen to the nature of the world in the
Samavasarana, [Jinavarehin] the Jina Devata, [Bhanidan] have said. ||95||  In
this way, Dharma and Adharma are the causes for movement and rest, not space.
Saying this, the four verses in the other section are complete. Although Dharma,
Adharma, and space are one in terms of their comprehension, they are different
in reality. This is stated here:  Dharma, Adharma, and space are not separate,
they are of equal measure. They are different due to their distinct qualities,
thus making them one and different. ||96||  Dharma, Adharma, and space are of
equal measure and are only together due to their shared space. In reality, they
are different due to their distinct qualities, which are: (1) their function in
movement, rest, and comprehension, and (2) their distinct regions as determined
by knowledge. ||96||  **Explanation of the Body of Space:**  **Meaning of the
Verse:** (Dharma, Adharma, and space) Dharma, Adharma, and space (loka-akasha)
are (of equal measure) of equal measure. Due to their (not being separate) non-
separateness and (distinct qualities) distinct qualities, they (make them one
and different) create oneness and difference.  **Commentary:** Here, it is
stated that although Dharma, Adharma, and space are one in terms of their
comprehension, they are different in reality.  Dharma, Adharma, and space are
one only due to their shared space (only due to their shared space in terms of
comprehension). In reality, they are different due to (1) their function in
movement, rest, and comprehension (distinct qualities) and (2) their distinct
regions as determined by knowledge (distinct qualities). ||96||  **Translation
of the Sanskrit Text:**  Now, the text shows that Dharma, Adharma, and space are
one in terms of their shared space, but different in terms of knowledge. Dharma,
Adharma, and space are substances. What are their specific qualities? They are
not separate and are of equal measure in terms of their function. What is their
nature? They are different due to their distinct qualities.

The five Astikayas, beginning with the Ākāśa Astikaya, are distinguished by
their unique characteristics. What do these characteristics do? They create
oneness in practice and difference in certainty. For example, just as this
living being, along with the five substances like Pudgala, creates oneness in
practice by being contained within the same field as other living beings, it
creates difference in certainty by its knowledge quality, which is characterized
by the ultimate consciousness and its playful nature, illuminating an infinite
number of qualities simultaneously in all things. Similarly, the substances of
Dharma, Adharma, Loka, and Ākāśa, being contained within the same field, are
indistinguishable and have the same magnitude, so they create oneness in
practice through their shared characteristics. However, they create difference
in certainty by their unique characteristics of motion, rest, and containment.
This is the meaning of the sūtra. || 96 ||  Thus, the Gāthā Sūtra has been
explained in the third place, describing the oneness and difference of Dharma,
Adharma, and Ākāśa.  In this way, the seventh Uttara Adhikāra, which explains
the Ākāśa Astikaya in three places through seven Gāthās, is complete within the
first Mahādhikāra, which discusses the five Astikayas and the six substances.

## Chapter 256: Description of the Five Astikayas and Six Dravyas, and a Chulika
Here, the corporeal and incorporeal nature, and the conscious and unconscious
nature of the Dravyas are described.  **Verse 97:**  * **Akasha, Kala, Jiva,
Dharma, and Adharma are incorporeal.** * **Pudgala Dravya is corporeal.** *
**Jiva is truly conscious among them.**  **Explanation:**  * **Corporeal** is
that which has the nature of possessing touch, taste, smell, and color. *
**Incorporeal** is that which has the nature of lacking touch, taste, smell, and
color. * **Conscious** is that which has the nature of possessing consciousness.
* **Unconscious** is that which has the nature of lacking consciousness.
Therefore:  * **Akasha** is incorporeal. * **Kala** is incorporeal. * **Jiva**
is incorporeal in its own form, but can become corporeal through association
with corporeal Dravyas. * **Dharma** is incorporeal. * **Adharma** is
incorporeal. * **Pudgala** is the only corporeal Dravya.  * **Akasha** is
unconscious. * **Kala** is unconscious. * **Dharma** is unconscious. *
**Adharma** is unconscious. * **Pudgala** is unconscious. * **Jiva** is the only
conscious Dravya.  **Anvayaartha (Meaning of the words in order):**  * **Akasha,
Kala, Jiva:** Akasha, Kala, Jiva * **Dharma, Adharma:** Dharma and Adharma *
**Murti Parihina:** are incorporeal * **Pudgala Dravya Murta:** Pudgala Dravya
is corporeal * **Teshu:** among them * **Jiva:** Jiva * **Khalu:** truly *
**Chetana:** conscious  **Commentary:**  Here, the corporeal and incorporeal
nature, and the conscious and unconscious nature of the Dravyas are described.
**Translation of the Sanskrit Commentary:**  After this, the commentary on the
Chulika describing the Five Astikayas and Six Dravyas continues until the eighth
verse. Within the eight verses, the verse beginning with "Aayas" primarily
describes the conscious and unconscious, corporeal and incorporeal nature. The
verse beginning with "Jiva Poggalakaya" primarily describes the active and
inactive nature. The verse beginning with "Je Khalu Indiyagejja" describes the
corporeal and incorporeal nature in another way. The two verses beginning with
"Kalo Parinam Bhavo" primarily describe the two types of time: the time of
experience, which is the time of the transformation of Jiva, Pudgala, etc., and
the time of certainty, which is the time that is the cause of the transformation
and is in accordance with the time of experience. The verse beginning with "Ede
Kalagas" primarily describes the nature of the Dravyas, the fact that they are
not bodies because they lack the second and subsequent parts. The two verses
beginning with "Evam Pavayan Saram" describe the result of contemplation, which
is the path to liberation, which is the nature of the pure Jiva, which is the
form of Kevala Jnana Darshan, which is part of the Five Astikayas, during the
time of the transformation of the Vitaraga Nirvikalpa Samadhi. Thus, these eight
verses describe the six stages of the path.

The **Panchaastikaya** (five categories of existence) and the **six dravyas**
(substances) are explained in the next eight gathas (verses). The main theme of
these eight gathas is **cetana** (consciousness) and **acetana** (non-
consciousness), **murta** (concrete) and **amurta** (abstract). The gathas like
"Aayaasa" etc. focus on **active** and **inactive** aspects. The gathas like
"Jeeva Moggalakaya" etc. focus on the **characteristics of amurta**. The gathas
like "Je Khalu Indiyagejja" etc. explain the **nine stages of existence** (nav
jirn paryay). The **time of action** (vyavahar kal) is the **state of
existence** and the **time of certainty** (nishchay kal) is the **cause of
change** (parinati) in the **existence of jiva, pudgala** etc. The gathas like
"Kalo Parinambhavo" etc. explain both types of time. The **characteristics of
dravya** are possible in this time. It has **dravya** (substance) because it is
possible. It is **akaya** (non-body) because it does not have second or other
regions. The gathas like "Ede Kalaagasa" etc. explain this. The **pure jiva**
(soul) with **kevalgyan** (perfect knowledge) and **kevaldarshan** (perfect
vision) is present within the five categories of existence. When it transforms
into **vitrag nirvikalp samadhi** (state of complete detachment and equanimity),
it becomes the **path of liberation** (nishchay moksha marg). The gathas like
"Evam Pavayan Saar" etc. explain the **fruits of this path of liberation**. In
this way, the eight gathas explain the **community** (samudaya) through the
**six realms** (sthal).  Now, the **concrete and abstract nature of dravyas**
and the **conscious and non-conscious nature of dravyas** are explained.
**General meaning:** (Aagasa, Kala, Jeeva) **Aakash** (space), **Kala** (time),
**Jeeva** (soul), (Dhamma, Adhamma) **Dharma** (merit) and **Adharma**
(demerit), (Muttiparihina) **amurta** (abstract) without form, (Ghoggal Davvam)
**Pudgala dravya** (matter) is **murta** (concrete). (Tesu) In these six,
(Khalu) definitely (Jeevo) **Jeeva dravya** (soul) is **cetana** (conscious).
**Specific meaning:** That which has **touch, taste, smell, and color** is
called **murta** (concrete). That which does not have these qualities is called
**amurta** (abstract). There are five **amurta** dravyas except **pudgala**.
Although **jeeva** is definitely **amurta** (abstract) due to its **indivisible
and single appearance** (akhand ek pratibhas may), it is also **murta**
(concrete) in practice due to the **association** (samsarg) with **karma**
(action) acquired by the **jeeva** which is **devoid of raga** (attachment) etc.
and has the **inherent nature of bliss** (sahaja anand) and is **devoid of the
realization of the true nature of the soul** (atma tattva bhavana). **Pudgala
dravya** is **murta** (concrete) due to its **touch, taste, smell, and color**.
**Jeeva** is **cetana** (conscious) due to its **infinite consciousness**
(ananta chaitanya) which is **free from doubt** (sanshaya) etc. and has the
**capacity to perceive itself and others** (swarapar parichchitti samarth). The
others are **acetana** (non-conscious) due to the **absence of self-illuminating
consciousness** (swarapar prakashka chaitanya). This is the meaning.

## 258 ## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  A living being
who accumulates karmic matter due to a life devoid of the realization of the
soul's true nature, which is pure bliss, is called a *mūrtika* due to its
association with such karmic matter. This living being is truly a *kṣetra*
(field) because it is capable of knowing itself and others without any doubt or
uncertainty, and it possesses the infinite potential of *chaitanya*
(consciousness). The other five substances are devoid of this self-illuminating
quality of *chaitanya*, and therefore they are all *achetan* (non-conscious).
This is the meaning. || 97 ||  Thus, the *Gāthā Sūtra* concludes by primarily
expounding on the nature of *chetana* (conscious) and *achetan* (non-conscious),
*mūrta* (material) and *amūrta* (immaterial).  Here, the active and inactive
nature is explained:  Living beings, along with *puḍgala* (matter), are active,
but not the rest. Living beings are *puḍgala* karana (those who have *puḍgala*
as their external instrument of action), and *skandha* (aggregates) are *kāla*
karana (those who have time as their external instrument of action). || 98 ||
**Explanation:**  * **Action** is the synonym for the *pariṣpanda* (vibration)
that is the cause of attaining a different location. * Living beings are active
when they are associated with an external instrument of action, and so are
*puḍgala*. * *Ākāśa* (space), *dharma* (merit), *adharma* (demerit), and *kāla*
(time) are inactive. * The external instrument of action for the activity of
living beings is *karma* (action), which is in the form of accumulated *puḍgala*
(matter). Therefore, they are *puḍgala* karana. * Due to the absence of *karma*,
*siddhās* (liberated souls) are inactive. * The external instrument of action
for the activity of *puḍgala* is *kāla* (time), which brings about change. *
*Kāla* (time) does not have an absence like *karma* does. Therefore, *puḍgala*
is not inactive like *siddhās*. || 98 ||  **Anvaya-ārtha (Meaning of the
Text):**  (Living beings, along with *puḍgala* bodies) are active when
associated with an external instrument of action, but not the rest of the
substances. Living beings are *puḍgala* karana (those who have *puḍgala* as
their external instrument of action), and *skandha* (aggregates) are *kāla*
karana (those who have time as their external instrument of action).  **Tīkā
(Commentary):**  Here, the active and inactive nature of the substances is
explained.  * **Action** is the synonym for the *pariṣpanda* (vibration) that is
the cause of attaining a different location. * Living beings are active when
they are associated with an external instrument of action, and so are *puḍgala*.
* *Ākāśa* (space), *dharma* (merit), *adharma* (demerit), and *kāla* (time) are
inactive. * The external instrument of action for the activity of living beings
is *karma* (action), which is in the form of accumulated *puḍgala* (matter).
Therefore, they are *puḍgala* karana.

The five Astikayas are the source of amrita (nectar). Their absence is the
reason for the inactivity of the Siddhas. The external means of activating the
pudgalas is the result-producing time, therefore the pudgalas are time-
conditioned.  Just as karma and other things do not have an absence, similarly,
the pudgalas do not have inactivity like the Siddhas. ||98||  **Commentary:**
Here, the active and inactive nature of the substances is explained. The jivas
(souls) are active along with the pudgalakaya (body of pudgalas). How? Along
with (saha). What is the meaning of saha? Along with external cooperating
causes. The remaining four substances are not active along with the jivas and
pudgalas. The external cause of the activity of the jivas is explained. The
jivas are pudgalakarna (caused by pudgalas) - they have acquired karma and non-
karma pudgalas due to their actions of mind, speech, and body, which are the
result of their experience of pure self-awareness, and their deviation from that
experience. These are the cause, reason, and reason for their activity.  Here,
the word skandha (aggregate) refers to two types of pudgalas: skandha
(aggregate) and skandhanu (atomic). What are they like? Active. By what? By the
time-conditioning (kalakarna) - the time-substance that is the cause of change.
It is clear that just as the Siddhas become inactive due to the absence of karma
and non-karma pudgalas when karma is destroyed by the power of pure self-
awareness, so it is not the case with the pudgalas. Why? Because time is always
present, being formless and devoid of color, etc. This is the meaning.  Thus,
the main point of the active and inactive nature is explained in the verse.
**Hindi Translation:**  **Uttanika:** Further, the active and inactive nature of
the substances is explained.  **General Meaning with Anvaya:** (Jiva) The jiva
(soul) and (pudgalakaya) the pudgalakaya, these two substances (saha) become
active (sakriya) due to the presence of external causes (havanti). (Sesa) The
remaining four substances (na ya) are not active. (Jiva) The jiva (soul) becomes
active due to the help of (pudgalakarna) the pudgalas and (khanda) the skandha
(aggregate) of the pudgalas (khalu) actually due to the (kalakarna du) time-
substance.  **Specific Meaning:** The jivas, due to their experience of pure
self-awareness, have accumulated karma and non-karma pudgalas through their
actions of mind, speech, and body. These are the cause of the activity of the
jivas. The skandha (aggregate) and skandhanu (atomic) of the pudgalas are the
two types of pudgalas, and the external cause of their change is the time-
substance. They become active due to it. Here, the meaning is that the jivas,
who become Siddhas by destroying karma through the power of pure self-awareness
and by being devoid of all karma and non-karma pudgalas, become inactive. This
does not happen with the pudgalas, because time, which is formless and devoid of
color, etc., is always present. Due to it, the pudgalas continue to be active as
much as possible. ||98||  Thus, the verse ends with the main point of active and
inactive nature.

## 260 ## Dravy - Description of the Five Astikayas ## This is the explanation
of the characteristics of the Murta and Amurta.   **1** Those objects that are
perceived by the senses of living beings are called Murta.  The rest, which is
the mind, is Amurta. The mind perceives both. || 99 ||  **1** Here, living
beings perceive objects with their senses of touch, taste, smell, and sight,
which are the objects of these senses, and have the nature of touch, taste,
smell, and color. Through the sense of hearing, the same objects are perceived
as transformed into sound and form, which are the causes of the object of the
sense of hearing. Sometimes these objects are gross, sometimes subtle, and
sometimes atomic. Because of their ability to be perceived by the senses,
whether they are perceived or not, they are called Murta.   The rest, all other
objects, which have the nature of the absence of touch, taste, smell, and color,
are called Amurta because they are not capable of being perceived by the senses.
Both of these (Murta and Amurta) are capable of being perceived by the mind. The
mind, which is not limited to any particular object, is not capable of being
attained, and is the means of knowledge, perception, and belief, perceives both
Murta and Amurta. || 99 ||  - Thus ends the Chulika.  **Anvayaartha:** (Ye khul)
Those objects (jivaiḥ indriyagrāhyāḥ viṣayāḥ) that are perceived by the senses
of living beings (te mūrtāḥ bhavanti) are Murta, and [śeṣa] the rest of the
objects (amūrta bhavati) are Amurta. (Cittaṃ) The mind (man) (ubhayaṃ) perceives
both of them [Murta and Amurta] (samādadāti) (knows them).  **Tīkā:** This is
the explanation of the characteristics of Murta and Amurta.  In this world,
living beings perceive objects with their senses of touch, taste, smell, and
sight, which are the objects of these senses, and have the nature of touch,
taste, smell, and color. Through the sense of hearing, the same objects are
perceived as transformed into sound and form, which are the causes of the object
of the sense of hearing. (These objects), sometimes are gross, sometimes subtle,
and sometimes atomic. Because of their ability to be perceived by the senses,
whether they are perceived or not, they are called Murta.  The rest, all other
objects, which have the nature of the absence of touch, taste, smell, and color,
are called Amurta because they are not capable of being perceived by the senses.
Both of these (the aforementioned two types, i.e., Murta and Amurta objects) are
capable of being perceived by the mind (man). The mind, which is not limited to
any particular object, is not capable of being attained, and is the means of
knowledge, perception, and belief, perceives both Murta and Amurta. || 99 ||

## Translation:  **Pancastikaya Prabhrut**  **261 Saṅkhya Taṅka -**  Now, in
another way, the nature of the **mūrta** (concrete) and **amūrta** (abstract) is
explained. Those things which are the objects of the senses, which are the
instruments of knowledge, are **karma-tāpa-patra** (karmic impressions). By whom
are they made? By the **jīvas** (souls) - those who are outward-looking, who are
intoxicated by the pleasure of objects, and who are devoid of the **nirvikalpa**
(unconditioned) bliss of the Self. These become **mūrta** (concrete) because
they are beyond the nature of objects, and are contrary to the true nature of
the Self. Some of them, though they are not objects of the senses in the present
time, due to their subtle nature, will become objects of the senses in the
future. Therefore, they are called **indriya-grahaṇa-yogya** (capable of being
perceived by the senses).  The rest, **amūrta** (abstract), are those which are
not objects of the senses, such as the **ātma-dravya** (soul-substance) which is
the basis of **ati-indriya-jñāna** (super-sensory knowledge) and **sukha**
(bliss), and the other five **dravya** (substances) besides **pudgala**
(matter).  **Citta** (mind) embraces both - **citta** embraces both the
**mūrta** and the **amūrta**. **Citta** is the cause of **mati-jñāna**
(intellectual knowledge) and **śruta-jñāna** (scriptural knowledge), and its
object is not fixed. Of these, that which is **ātma-grāhaka** (perceiver of the
Self) in the form of **bhāva-śruta** (intuitive knowledge) is **pratyakṣa**
(direct knowledge), and that which is known as **aṣṭāṅga-caturdaśa-pūrva-rūpa-
paramāgama** (the twelve angas, fourteen pūrva-rūpas, and the ultimate
scriptures) is **parokṣa** (indirect knowledge) in the form of **vyāpti-jñāna**
(knowledge of pervasiveness), though it is similar to **kevala-jñāna**
(omniscience).  Thus it is said: "**Su-kevalaṁ ca ṇāṇaṁ doṣiṇavi sarisāṇi hoti
bohādo. Su-ṇāṇaṁ ca parokkhaṁ paccakkhaṁ kevalaṁ ṇāṇaṁ**" (True omniscience is
like a mirror to the faults. True knowledge is both indirect and direct, and is
omniscience).  Thus, the **gāthā** (verse) explaining the nature of the
**mūrta** and **amūrta** is complete.   **Hindi Taṅka -**  **Uttānīkā -**
Further, the nature of the **mūrta** and **amūrta** is explained in another way.
**Anvaya-sahita-sāmānya-ārtha -**  (Jīvahiṁ) By the **jīvas** (souls), (khalu)
certainly, (je viṣaya) those objects, (indriya-gejžhā) which are capable of
being perceived by the senses, (huṁti) are, (te mūrta) they are **mūrta**
(concrete). (Seṣa) The rest, all the five **dravya** (substances) including the
**jīvas**, (amūrtaṁ) are **amūrta** (abstract). (Cittaṁ) Mind, (ubhayaṁ) both,
(samādiyati) embraces.  **Višeṣa-ārtha -**  Those **jīvas** who are delighted in
the pleasure of objects, and who are outside the taste of the nectar of bliss,
which is **vītarāga** (devoid of attachment) and **nirvikalpa** (unconditioned),
those who perceive the objects of the senses, they are **mūrta** (concrete).
Those objects of the senses are devoid of objects, and are contrary to the true
nature of the Self, which is the nature of blissful Self-awareness. Some of
these **pudgala** (matter) **mūrta** (concrete) **dravya** (substances) are so
subtle that they are not perceived by the senses in the present time, but in the
future, when they become capable of being perceived by the senses, they will
become objects of the senses. The **amūrta** (abstract) are those which are not
objects of the senses, such as the **ātma-dravya** (soul-substance) which is the
basis of **ati-indriya-jñāna** (super-sensory knowledge) and **sukha** (bliss),
and the other five **dravya** (substances) besides **pudgala** (matter).
**Citta** (mind) embraces both the **mūrta** and the **amūrta**.  This **citta**
is the cause of **mati-jñāna** (intellectual knowledge) and **śruta-jñāna**
(scriptural knowledge). Its object is not fixed. Of these, that which is **ātma-
grāhaka** (perceiver of the Self) in the form of **bhāva-śruta** (intuitive
knowledge) is **pratyakṣa** (direct knowledge), and that which is known as
**aṣṭāṅga-caturdaśa-pūrva-rūpa-paramāgama** (the twelve angas, fourteen pūrva-
rūpas, and the ultimate scriptures) is **parokṣa** (indirect knowledge) in the
form of **vyāpti-jñāna** (knowledge of pervasiveness), though it is similar to
**kevala-jñāna** (omniscience).

##  Translation:  **9.**  The expectation of knowledge about the description of
the six substances and the five astikayas is the same for both Shruta Jnana and
Kevala Jnana, but Shruta Jnana is indirect, while Kevala Jnana is direct.
**10.**  Thus, the verse ends by describing the nature of the concrete and
abstract in a different way. This is a description of the nature of Vyavahar
Kala (practical time) and Nishchay Kala (absolute time). Kala (time) is born
from Parinam (change), and Parinam is born from Dravya Kala (substance-time).
The nature of both is that Kala is momentary and constant.  **100.**  Kala is
born from Parinam, and Parinam is born from Dravya Kala.  **10.**  The nature of
both is that Kala is momentary and constant.  **Commentary:** This is a
statement about the nature of Vyavahar Kala and Nishchay Kala.  There, the
sequential Paryaya (aspect) called "Samaya" is Vyavahar Kala, and the Dravya
(substance) that is its basis is Nishchay Kala.  There, Vyavahar Kala is a
Paryaya of Nishchay Kala, but it is known to be measured by the Parinam of Jiva-
Pudgalas (living beings and particles), therefore it is called "born from the
Parinam of Jiva-Pudgalas". And the Parinam of Jiva-Pudgalas is born in the
presence of Dravya Kala, which is the external cause, therefore it is called
"born from Dravya Kala".  The meaning here is that Vyavahar Kala is determined
by the Parinam of Jiva-Pudgalas, and Nishchay Kala is determined by the
impossibility of the Parinam of Jiva-Pudgalas being otherwise (i.e., the Parinam
of Jiva-Pudgalas cannot be formed in any other way).  The momentary Vyavahar
Kala is due to the subtle Paryaya being only as long as it lasts, and the
eternal Nishchay Kala is due to its being the Dravya that is the basis of its
own Guna Paryaya (aspect of qualities), and therefore being imperishable
forever.

##  Translation:  **263. There, the transactional time is momentary, because it
is only as much as a subtle modification (as much as the time itself), the
definitive time is eternal, because it is always indestructible in its form as
the fundamental substance of its quality modifications.** ||100||
**Commentary:**  Here, the nature of transactional time and definitive time is
established. Time, in the form of moments, minutes, hours, days, etc., is
transactional time. How is it? It is born of modification - the slow movement of
atoms, the blinking of the eyelids, the movement of the hand holding a water
vessel, the movement of the sun, etc. This is the nature of the modification in
the form of the quality modification of the pudgala substance. Because it is
manifested by it, it is revealed, therefore, in transactions, it is considered
to be born of the pudgala modification. But in reality, the modification of the
definitive time is in the form of the kalaanu substance. The modification, born
of the substance time - the aforementioned pudgala modification, starting from
the movement of atoms, etc., is born from the kalaanu substance, which is the
cause of the lower stone and the outer ring in the rotation of the potter's
wheel, like the fire for the reader in the winter. Therefore, it is born of the
substance time. This is the nature of both the definitive and transactional
time. What is the nature of transactional time? It is born of modification,
because it is manifested by the pudgala modification. Definitive time, however,
is the cause of modification. Time is momentary - transactional time in the form
of time is momentary, but definitive time is eternal - because it is always
indestructible due to its being the basis of its own quality modifications.
Here, although a being who has attained liberation through the three jewels of
distinction, non-distinction, and the jewel of knowledge, attains the ultimate
happiness, which is the goal to be achieved, by being free from attachment,
etc., and being eternally blissful, the being is not the cause of it, but time
is not the cause. Thus, it is said: "The self is the cause of its own
attainment," etc. ||100||

##  Chapter 264: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas  The term
"Kalaki" is a synonym for the definitive (**niścaya**) time. The transformation
of pudgala, such as a student using fire for warmth in winter, or the lower
stone supporting the potter's wheel, is caused by the external, cooperative
cause, which is the time-like substance (**dravya-kāla**). Therefore,
transformation is said to be caused by **dravya-kāla**.   **Vyavahāra-kāla**
arises from the transformation of pudgalas, and is therefore a product of
transformation. **Niścaya-kāla** is the cause of transformation, and is
therefore the generator of transformation.   **Vyavahāra-kāla**, which is time
in the practical sense, is fleeting like a moment, while **niścaya-kāla**, which
is the definitive time, is eternal, being the basis of its own qualities and
synonyms.   The implication here is that although a living being, due to the
influence of **kāla-labdhi** (the attainment of time), attains the path to
liberation, which is the three jewels of distinction and non-distinction
(**bheda** and **abheda**), or the three jewels of practical and definitive
(**vyavahāra** and **niścaya**), and becomes capable of attaining the ultimate
happiness, which is free from attachment and other passions, and is eternal and
blissful, and of a single nature, the cause of this attainment is the living
being, not time. As it is said: "Liberation is achieved by the living being
itself as the cause." (10)  This explains the division of time into eternal and
momentary. Time is said to be eternal, as it is the basis of possibility. It is
born, decays, and is both short and long. (101)  The term "time" refers to the
eternal, which is the form of existence. It is born, decays, and is both short
and long. (101)  The particular substance that is always referred to as "this is
time, this is time" is eternal, as it indicates its own existence. However, that
which is born and decays is a synonym of time, which is a particular substance.
Although it is fleeting like a moment, it is considered to be long-lasting due
to the power of logic, which shows its continuous existence. Therefore, the
practical use of time, such as the analogy of a sand-glass, an ocean, etc., is
not contradicted.   Therefore, **niścaya-kāla** is eternal, as it is a
substance, while **vyavahāra-kāla** is momentary, as it is a synonym. (101)
**Explanation of the meaning:** The term "time" is a representation of
existence, and therefore **niścaya-kāla** is eternal. **Vyavahāra-kāla**, on the
other hand, is born and decays, and is also long-lasting (in terms of its flow).
**Commentary:** This statement describes the two divisions of time: eternal and
momentary. The particular substance that is always referred to as "this is time,
this is time" is eternal, as it indicates its own existence.

The **Pancastikaya Prakrut** (265) states that the **Nischya Kala** (true time)
is eternal, manifesting its true nature, while the **Vyavahara Kala** (practical
time) is a synonym for a particular substance, which is destroyed as soon as it
is born. Although it is fleeting, it shows its lineage (flow), so there is no
fault in calling it "long-lasting" by the force of **naya** (logic). Therefore,
**Aavlika**, **Palyopama**, **Sagaropama**, etc., are not prohibited as
practical time.  Thus, it is said here that **Nischya Kala** is eternal because
it is a substance, while **Vyavahara Kala** is momentary because it is a
synonym.

## Chapter 266: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikaayas  Although
it is not eternal in the sense of two aksharas, it is eternal because it is
worthy of being called by the word "time." It is important to know this as the
definitive time.  Practical time is born and destroyed in relation to the
present moment, it is perishable moment by moment, yet it is also considered to
be long-lasting in the sense of a lineage of past and future times, like the
ocean of moments, etc. There is no fault in this. In this way, it is important
to know that definitive time is eternal, and practical time is impermanent.  Or,
in another way, the nature of definitive and practical time is described as
follows: That which is beginningless and infinite, devoid of any conception or
distinction of time, etc., is formless and intangible, and exists in the sky as
the substance of time, that is definitive time. The same substance of time, in
its synonym, is the subtle synonym of time, and in relation to the collection of
times, it is called practical time, which is any assumed distinction of time,
like a blink, an hour, etc. || 101 ||  Thus, the thoughts of the auspicious
beings who are well-established in their own unchanging bliss, are merely the
wonders of consciousness, for them, the external cause is the attainment of
time. That same time is of two types: definitive and practical. Its description
is mainly given in two verses in the fourth chapter.  This is the establishment
of the substance-hood and non-substance-hood of time.  These time, space,
dharma, adharma, and living beings, obtain the designation of substance, but
time does not have substance-hood. || 102 ||  Just as living beings, pudgala,
dharma, adharma, and space, are all designated as substances due to their
possession of all the characteristics of substances, so is time. Thus, there are
six substances. But just as living beings, pudgala, dharma, adharma, and space,
have the characteristic of being located in a specific place, and thus have
substance-hood, time does not have substance-hood because it is located in one
place, namely space. Therefore, time is not primarily discussed in the chapter
on the five astikaayas. It is included here because it is a synonym of the
transformation of living beings and pudgala, and because its substance-hood is
inferred from the impossibility of its transformation otherwise. || 102 ||  Thus
ends the explanation of the substance of time.  Meaning of the words: [These]
this (time, space) time, space (dharma, adharma) dharma, adharma (living beings)

The five astikayas, beginning with the pudgala, and the jivas (all) obtain the
designation 'dravya'. However, time does not have the designation 'kaya'.
Commentary: This is a statement about the establishment of time as a dravya and
the denial of its being an astikaya. Just as jiva, pudgala, dharma, adharma, and
akasha obtain the designation 'dravya' because they possess all the
characteristics of a dravya, similarly, time also obtains the designation
'dravya' (because it possesses all the characteristics of a dravya). Thus, there
are six dravyas. However, just as jiva, pudgala, dharma, adharma, and akasha
have the designation 'astikaya' because they have the characteristic of entering
into two or more places, time does not have the designation 'astikaya' because
its kalanas (units of time) are one-place-only, even though their number is
equal to the number of regions in the lokakasha. For this very reason, time is
not mentioned primarily in the chapter on the five astikayas. However, it is
included here because it is a dravya, as it is known through the transformations
of jivas and pudgalas, and because its existence is inferred from the
impossibility of the transformations of jivas and pudgalas without it. Thus, the
explanation of time is complete.

## Six Substances - Description of Five Astikayas  **Special Meaning:** The
characteristics of a substance are three, as stated in the introductory lecture,
namely: that which always exists, that which undergoes production, decay, and
transformation, and that which is the bearer of qualities and modifications. All
six possess these three characteristics, hence they are six substances. Among
these, time is not an Astikaya, because it does not possess the characteristics
of the five Astikayas, such as the pure knowledge, perception, nature, and pure
Jiva Astikaya, which are present in the undivided aggregate form of space. As it
is said:  **268** Just as a heap of jewels, while occupying all space, holds
different jewels, so too, the time atoms are present in all space, one by one,
in each region. However, they never meet each other. These time atoms are
countless substances. The number of time atoms is equal to the number of regions
in space, which is countless. Here, the implication is that except for the pure
Jiva substance, which includes pure knowledge, etc., pure qualities, and pure
modifications like omniscience, non-duality, lightness, etc., the remaining five
substances are to be abandoned. **102**  In this way, time does not possess the
characteristics of an Astikaya, but it is a substance. This is explained in the
five sections of the Sutra.  **Result of Understanding:** This is the conclusion
of the explanation of the five Astikayas.  **103** Thus, having understood the
essence of the teachings and the collection of the five Astikayas, whoever
abandons attachment and aversion, he attains liberation from suffering.  **103**
Indeed, nothing else is taught in the entire discourse except the five
Astikayas, which are related to time. Therefore, this collection of the five
Astikayas is the essence of the teachings. Whoever understands this meaning,
which encompasses the essence of all reality, and recognizes his own self, which
is within the Jiva Astikaya, as being eternally pure and luminous in nature, and
observes the modifications of his own nature, which are caused by the continuous
chain of karma, attachment, aversion, and their consequences, and experiences
them as his own, and whose light of discrimination, kindled by this
understanding, extinguishes the chain of karma, the consequences of attachment
and aversion, he, like an atom that is attracted to the qualities of pure love
and repelled from future bondage, falls away from past bondage, and, like a drop
of water heated to a boil, attains liberation from suffering.  **Meaning of the
Sentence:** [Thus] in this way, [the essence of the teachings] the essence of
the teachings, [the collection of the five Astikayas] the collection of the five
Astikayas...

"Pancastikaya Prabhrut" 269 "Pancastikayagra Sangrahako" (Vijnāya) knowing [ : ]
who (Rāgadveshau) Rāgadveshako [ Muñcati] leaves, (Sa) he (Duḥkhaparimokṣam
Gāhate) is freed from suffering. Tīkā—Here, the fruit of understanding
Pancastikaya is said, concluding the explanation of Pancastikaya! In reality,
nothing else is expounded besides Pancastikaya, including the entire discourse
time, therefore, the essence of the discourse is this 'Pancastikayasangraha'.
The man who, knowing this 'Pancastikayasangraha', which speaks of the entire
truth, in essence (according to the meaning, in the true way), in half-form (for
the sake of attaining benefit), knowing this, in the Jivaastikaya mentioned in
it, determines himself (his own soul) to be extremely pure, of the nature of
consciousness, seeing the changes in his form, imposed by the tradition of Anadi
Rāgadveshaparināma and Karmabandha, which are mutually cause and effect, at that
time, when the light of discrimination manifests, he leaves the
Rāgadveshaparināti, which initiates the tradition of Karmabandha, that man,
whose affection truly becomes old, faces the inferior quality of affection, like
an atom, turning away from future bondage, being freed from past bondage, the
suffering, like the condition of water heated by fire (being agitated), he is
freed from that. || 103 || Saṃ. Tā. - Ath Pancastikāyādhhyayanasy Mukhyavṛttyā

## 270 The description of the six substances and five aggregates [**muyadi**]
abandons attachment and aversion [**so**] [**so**] [**dukkhaparimokkha**]
attains liberation from suffering [**gahadi**].  **Special Meaning:** The name
of this text, "Panchaastikaya Sangraha," is given because it briefly describes
the five aggregates and six substances. Primarily, it describes the pure soul
aggregate, which is essential for the path of liberation for those souls who are
engaged in supreme meditation. Although the Dvadashaanga is very extensive, this
text is its essence, as we have said before. By understanding this text, one
abandons attachment and aversion, which produce the karmic influx that gives
rise to extraordinary joy and sorrow, as well as future attachment and other
faults, and which are abandoned by the aspiring soul. This soul, through the
feeling of attaining the unchanging soul, experiences the supreme bliss, which
is like nectar, and is freed from various types of physical and mental suffering
related to the four states of existence. This is the meaning. || 103 ||  This is
the description of the process of liberation from suffering. By knowing this
meaning, the aspiring soul, having abandoned delusion, becomes free from
attachment and aversion, and is freed from both future and past bondage. || 104
||  **Commentary:** This is the description of the process of liberation from
suffering.  First, a soul knows the pure, conscious nature of the soul, which is
the meaning of this scripture. Therefore, he strives to follow it. Therefore,
his delusion of perception is destroyed, and the light of knowledge shines forth
as he becomes aware of his true nature. Then, attachment and aversion are
pacified. Then, both future and past bondage are destroyed. Then, because there
is no longer any cause for bondage, he remains eternally in his true nature. ||
104 ||  Thus ends the first Shruta Skandha of the Samaya Vyakhya, which
describes the six substances and five aggregates. || 1 ||  **Anvayaartha:**
[**Jiva:**] The soul (**etad artha jnatva**) knowing this meaning (**tad
anugamano dyatah**) striving to follow it (**nihatamoh:**) having destroyed
delusion (**darshanamoh ka kshaya kar**) destroying the delusion of perception
(**prashamiraragadveshah**) having pacified attachment and aversion (**hatapara
parah bhavati**) becomes one who has destroyed both future and past bondage.

The five-fold substance (Panchaastikaya) is the nectar of immortality.  (271)
Delusion (Moha) is destroyed, therefore the light of knowledge (Jnana Jyoti)
manifests due to the knowledge of the true nature (Swaroop). Therefore,
attachment and aversion (Raga-Dvesha) are pacified and cease. Therefore, the
bondage of the past and the future (Aavarana and Aayushya) is destroyed.
Therefore, due to the absence of the cause of future bondage, the true nature
(Swaroop) always shines and remains powerful (Pratapvant). ||104||  Thus, the
first Shruta Skandha, named "Shaddravya-Panchaastikaya Varnan", in the
commentary called "Samaya Vyakhya", is completed.   (Translation of the Sanskrit
commentary) Now, the sequence of the cause of liberation from suffering is
explained. (Muni Doon) Knowing this (Etam) - this directly perceived, eternally
blissful, pure soul substance (Jivaastikaya Lakshana) as the true meaning
(Artha) of the specific object (Vishishta Padartha), and relying on (Tam Anu)
this pure soul substance (Jivaastikaya Lakshana) as the meaning (Artha) to be
understood. (Gamanujjudo) Eager to experience (Gamanodyata) and immersed in it
(Tanmayatva), (Nihadamoho) free from the delusion (Moha) that hinders the
attainment of true knowledge (Samyaktvapratibandhakadarshanamoha) - the
realization that the pure soul (Shuddhatma) is the only object worthy of pursuit
(Ruciroopa Nishchaya Samyaktvapratibandhakadarshanamoha). Therefore, delusion is
destroyed (Nishta Darshanamoha). (Pasami Idaraagadoso) Due to the absence of the
delusion (Moha) that hinders the practice of right conduct (Charitra) - the
delusion that arises from the attachment to the changing nature of the soul
(Nishchalatmaparinatiroopa Nishchaya Charitrapratikulcharitramohodaya) -
attachment and aversion (Raga-Dvesha) are pacified. Thus, when there is
knowledge of the difference between the self and the non-self (Swaraparayo:
Bhedajnaane), and when there is true knowledge (Samyaktv) and right conduct
(Charitra) based on the pure soul (Shuddhatma), then (Havdi) it happens. How?
(Hadaparaavaro) Destroyed (Hataparaapara). Here, liberation (Moksha) is referred
to by the word "Para" because it is the foundation of the qualities like supreme
bliss (Paramanandajnaana). The word "Para" refers to liberation (Moksha), and
"Apara" refers to the cycle of birth and death (Samsara), which is different
from liberation. Therefore, the cycle of birth and death is destroyed (Nishta
Paraapara). Who is this? (Jeevo) The aspiring soul (Bhavya Jeeva). ||104||
Thus, two verses (Gatha) have been explained in the sixth section (Sthala),
which deals with the fruits of knowing the five-fold substance (Panchaastikaya
Parijnaana Phala).  In the first major section (Mahaadhikara), the eighth sub-
section (Antaradhikara) known as "Chulika" is to be understood, which consists
of eight verses (Gatha) and six sections (Sthala).  In this treatise on the
five-fold substance (Panchaastikaya Praabhrut Grantha), the following have been
explained in the order mentioned earlier: - The commentary on the word "Samaya"
(Samaya Shabda Peethika) in seven verses (Gatha). - The commentary on the
substance (Dravya Peethika) in fourteen verses (Gatha). - The importance of
right knowledge, conduct, and time (Nishchaya Vyavahar Kaal Mukhyata) in five
verses (Gatha). - The explanation of the soul substance (Jivaastikaya Vyakhyana)
in thirty-five verses (Gatha). - The explanation of the matter substance
(Pudgalaastikaya Vyakhyana) in ten verses (Gatha). - The description of the
duality of merit and demerit (Dharmaadharmaastikadwaya Vivaran) in seven verses
(Gatha). - The explanation of the space substance (Aakaashaastikaya Vyakhyana)
in seven verses (Gatha). - The importance of the "Chulika" (Chulika Mukhyatva)
in eight verses (Gatha).  Thus, a total of one hundred and eleven verses (Gatha)
and eight sub-sections (Adhikara) have been explained.  This first major section
(Mahaadhikara) named "Panchaastikaya Shaddravya Praatipadan", written by Shri
Jayasenaacharya, in the commentary called "Taatparya Vritti", is completed.
||1||  (Translation of the Hindi commentary) (Uththanika) Now, the sequence of
the means of liberation from suffering is explained.  (Anvaya Sahit Samaanyarth)
[Etad] This essence of this treatise (Grantha) - the soul substance (Atma
Padartha) - [Muni Uun] knowing (Jan Karke) [Tadanu Gamanujjudo] the aspiring
soul (Jeeva) eager to experience (Anubhav Karneka Udyami) [Nihadamoho]
destroying (Nash Karke) false belief (Mithyaadarshan) [Pasamiyaragadoso]
pacifying (Shant Karta Hua) attachment and aversion (Raga-Dvesha)
[Hridaparaavaro] crossing over (Par) from the cycle of birth and death (Samsara)
[Havdi] becomes (Ho Jata Hai).  (Vishesharth) This directly perceived
(Pratyakshibhut) eternally blissful (Nitya Anandamayi) pure soul substance

A noble soul, by knowing through self-awareness the special description of the
six substances and the five astikayas, and by aiming to be absorbed in the pure
jiva-astikaya form of substance, with the aim of that very substance, is free
from the delusion of perception that prevents the beautiful right perception of
'only the pure soul is worthy of being grasped'. By destroying the delusion of
conduct that is contrary to the conduct of certainty, which is the
transformation into the unshakeable soul, he becomes free from passions.
**Meaning:** As stated earlier, when there is knowledge of the distinction
between self and others, there is the beautiful right perception of the pure
soul, then there is the conduct of stability in the pure soul, and then, through
this very practice, one crosses over the world. Here, because it is the basis of
supreme bliss, supreme knowledge, etc., liberation is called 'para' (beyond) -
that which is spoken of by the word 'para', that liberation, destroys the
'apara' (other), that is, the world, which is different from it. || 104 ||
Thus, two verses are completed, stating the fruit of the knowledge of the five
astikayas. In this way, in the first great chapter, it is necessary to know the
eighth internal chapter, called the 'chulika', through eight verses, from the
six realms.  In this treatise called 'Pancha-astikaya', the word 'samaya' is
introduced in seven verses, in the order stated earlier, then the substance is
introduced in fourteen verses. Then, in five verses, there is the main point of
certainty, conduct, and time. Then, in fifty-three verses, there is an
explanation of the jiva-astikaya. Then, in ten verses, there is an explanation
of the pudgala-astikaya. Then, in seven verses, there is a description of both
the dharma-astikaya and the adharma-astikaya. Then, in seven verses, there is an
explanation of the akasha-astikaya. Then, in eight verses, there is the main
point of the chulika. In this way, eight internal chapters are completed in one
hundred and eleven verses. Shri Amritchandra Maharaj has commented on only 104
verses, not on the six verses related to knowledge and one on the distinctions
of the punal skandha.  Thus, the first great chapter, which speaks of the five
astikayas and the six substances, is completed in the commentary called
'Tatparya-vritti' by Shri Jayasen Acharya. || 1 ||

The first chapter of this scripture explains the pure essence of truth (pure
soul essence) to wise beings through the exposition of the nature of substances.
Now, the path to that essence (the path to liberation) will be described by
introducing the different categories of substances (nine categories of
substances). (7)  This is a declaration preceded by praise of the enlightened

## Translation:  **274**  The description of the nine substances and the path to
liberation. There are ten sub-chapters within this chapter. In the first sub-
chapter, starting with the salutation verse, the Acharya explains the path to
liberation in the worldly realm, primarily through four verses. This is the
first sub-chapter, the "Samudaya Patanika".  **Explanation:**  The author, after
saluting the last Tirthankara, the Supreme Lord, declares his intention to
explain the nine substances, their relation to the five Astikayas and six
Dravyas, and the path to liberation. He begins with a salutation, saying, "I bow
down with my head to Mahavira, the cause of non-rebirth."  He then states, "I
will explain the nine substances, the different aspects of the five Astikayas
and six Dravyas, and the path to liberation."  The author explains that the path
to liberation is the cause of infinite knowledge and other virtues, which are
the desired fruits for those who thirst for the nectar of liberation. He salutes
Mahavira, the last Jinesvara, the embodiment of the three jewels, and the
propagator of the present great Dharma Tirtha.  The author then explains that
the path to liberation in the worldly realm is the cause of the path to
liberation in the absolute realm, which is characterized by the three jewels of
non-duality, pure self-awareness, and unwavering perception. He also mentions
the nine substances, which are the objects of knowledge and perception, and are
the components of the path to liberation in the worldly realm.  Although the
path to liberation is explained in detail later in the text, the author briefly
mentions the nine substances here. This brief mention is intended to provide a
concise overview of the nine substances.  The explanation of the nine substances
is presented here. They are the objects of the path to liberation in the worldly
realm.

I will now speak of the five Astikayas and six Brahvyakas (Paryatyabhangam), the
nine substances that differentiate (Mokkassa) and show the path to liberation
(Khocchami).  **Special Meaning:** In the first half of this verse, the author
has paid homage to his beloved deity for auspiciousness. This also indicates
that the statement of Shri Mahavira Swami is evidence because he preached the
great Dharma, the Tirtha, which came in this Ratna Trayamayi (three jewels)
tendency. Therefore, he is the cause of cooperation for the Bhavyas, the thirsty
souls for the nectar of liberation, the happiness of liberation, for the
attainment of infinite knowledge and other qualities, the liberation, in the
tradition of the last Tirthankara, Shri Mahavira Swami. In the second half of
this verse, the author has pledged that I will describe the nine substances
which are the subject of Samyag Darshan and Samyag Gyan, the limbs of the
practical path of liberation. This practical path of liberation is the cause of
the certain path of liberation in the tradition. Where there is pure soul's
interest, perception and unwavering experience, it is called Abhed Ratna Tray or
the certain path of liberation. Although there is a special explanation of the
path of liberation in the Chulika in this book, there is also a brief
explanation of the nine substances here because these nine substances are the
subject of the practical path of liberation, this is the intention.  **Path of
Liberation:**  The path of liberation is characterized by:  * **Samyaktva-Jnana-
Yuktam:**  Combined with right faith and knowledge. * **Rag-Dos Parihinam:**
Free from attachment and aversion. * **Charitram:** Right conduct. * **Labdh-
Buddhinaam:**  Those who have attained wisdom. * **Bhavyanam:**  Those who are
worthy of liberation.  **Explanation:**  This is the first indication of the
path of liberation.  * It is only combined with right faith and knowledge, not
with wrong faith and ignorance. * It is only right conduct, not wrong conduct. *
It is only free from attachment and aversion, not with attachment and aversion.
* It is only the path of liberation, not the path of bondage. * It is only the
path, not the wrong path. * It is only for those who are worthy of liberation,
not for those who are not. * It is only for those who have attained wisdom, not
for those who have not. * It is only for those who have destroyed their
passions, not for those who have not.  This is the eightfold rule that should be
observed.  **Meaning:**  Combined with right faith and knowledge, free from
attachment and aversion, right conduct, for those who have attained wisdom, for
those who are worthy of liberation, the path of liberation is attained.

The description of the path to liberation (moksha) through the nine substances
(navapadaartha) is as follows: It is characterized by right faith
(sammattananajutta), not by the absence of right faith; it is characterized by
right conduct (charitra), not by misconduct; it is characterized by the absence
of attachment and aversion (ragadosaparhiina), not by the presence of attachment
and aversion; it is the path to liberation (mokkhass maggo), not the path to
bondage; it is for the worthy (bhalvaan), not for the unworthy (abhalvaan); it
is for those who have attained knowledge (laddhabuddhiin), not for those who
have not attained knowledge; it is characterized by the destruction of passions
(kshiinakashaya), not by the presence of passions. Thus, there are eight ways to
understand this rule.  This is further explained by the principle of affirmation
and negation (anvayavyatireka). Affirmation means that something is possible,
while negation means that something is not possible. For example, liberation is
possible when there is the cause of liberation, which is right faith and
conduct. This is affirmation. Liberation is not possible when there is no cause
of liberation. This is negation.  This principle is further strengthened by the
fact that when there is a cause, such as fire, there is an effect, such as
burning. When there is no cause, there is no effect. Therefore, the effect is
dependent on the cause. This is the principle of cause and effect.

The path to complete liberation (Moksha) is only possible for those who have
attained the five great vows (Panchaastikaya). As long as there are passions
(Kashaya) and the soul is impure, the path to complete liberation is not
possible. Here, we should consider the eight types of rules based on Anvaya and
Vyatireka. Anvaya and Vyatireka are described as follows: the presence of which
makes an action possible is called Anvaya, and the absence of which makes an
action impossible is called Vyatireka. For example, the liberation (Moksha)
action is possible only when the cause of liberation, which is the state of
certainty and conduct (Nischya Vyavahar), is present. This is called Anvaya in
the form of a rule. And when this cause of liberation is absent, the action of
liberation does not occur. This is called Vyatireka in the form of a
prohibition. This is further strengthened by the example that smoke, etc., can
only occur when there is fire, etc., as the cause. When fire, etc., are absent,
smoke, etc., will not occur. Because fire, etc., are the cause of smoke, etc.,
there is a rule between action and cause. This is the meaning. || 106 ||  The
right faith, knowledge, and conduct (Samyagdarshan, Samyagjnana, Samyacharita)
should be explained. The understanding of these (Bhavas) is called knowledge
(Jnana). The right conduct (Charitra) is the state of equanimity (Samabhava)
towards all objects (Vishaya) and the avoidance of wrong paths (Virudha-Margas).
|| 107 ||  Right faith (Samyaktva) is the understanding of these (Bhavas) as
faith (Shraddha). || 107 ||  Right conduct (Charitra) is the state of equanimity
(Samabhava) towards all objects (Vishaya) and the avoidance of wrong paths
(Virudha-Margas). || 107 ||  The nine substances (Bhavas) are the forms of the
five great vows (Panchaastikaya) that have been refined by time (Kalakalit). The
absence of faith (Ashraddha) due to the rise of wrong faith (Mithyadarshan) is
one substance. The other substance is faith (Shraddha), which is the right faith
(Samyagdarshan), the seed of the certainty of the true nature of the soul
(Atmatattva) as pure consciousness (Shuddhachaitanya). The removal of these
(Bhavas) that are wrongly perceived due to the rise of wrong faith
(Mithyadarshan) and the influence of past karmas (Naubhyana-Samskara), etc., is
the right knowledge (Samyagjnana), the seed of the realization of the true
nature of the soul (Atmatattva) as the mind, knowledge, and consciousness
(Manamjnana-Chetana). The right conduct (Samyacharita) is the state of
equanimity (Samabhava) towards all objects (Vishaya) and the avoidance of wrong
paths (Virudha-Margas) due to the presence of right faith (Samyagdarshan) and
right knowledge (Samyagjnana). It is the seed of the happiness of liberation
(Aponarbhava-Soukhya) that is not subject to change (Atyarmanee), not subject to
desire (Ananee), and not subject to rebirth (Aponarbhava). This is the three-
fold path to liberation (Moksha) which will be explained further by the state of
certainty and conduct (Nischya Vyavahar). Here, the nine substances
(Navapadarthas) are mentioned as the reason for introducing them as the subject
of right faith (Samyagdarshan) and right knowledge (Samyagjnana). || 107 ||
Meaning of Anvaya: (Bhavanaam) of the substances (Navapadarthoka) (Shraddhanam)
faith (Samyaktva) is the right faith, [Teshaam Adhigamo] their understanding
(Jnana) is knowledge, (Virudha-Marganaam) on the wrong paths (Vishayeshu)
towards the objects (Samabhava) equanimity (Charitram) is right conduct.

This is an explanation of the path to liberation, which is based on right faith,
right knowledge, and right conduct.  The nine substances, along with time, are
the six categories of existence, which are actually 'states'. The false faith
that arises from the emergence of false perception is the absence of faith in
these 'states'. The opposite of this is right faith, which is faith in these
nine substances. Right faith is the seed of the certainty of the true nature of
the soul, which is pure consciousness. Just as the experience of sailing in a
boat is a result of the boat's construction, the emergence of false perception
leads to a distorted understanding of these 'states'. When the emergence of
false perception ceases, the correct understanding of these 'states' is called
right knowledge. This is the seed of the experience of the soul, which is
primarily knowledge and consciousness.   Right conduct is the state of
equanimity that arises from the harmony of right faith and right knowledge. This
equanimity is free from the passions of attachment and aversion towards the
objects of the senses and mind. It is the seed of the supreme happiness of
liberation, which is free from rebirth.  This unique path to liberation, which
is based on right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, will be further
explained in terms of its certainty and practice. Here, the nine substances,
which are the subject matter of right faith and right knowledge, have been
introduced as a preface. ||107||  **Sanskrit Commentary:**  Now, the special
description of the three-fold path of right faith, right knowledge, and right
conduct is given.  What is right faith? It is faith that is free from the
opposite attachment that arises from the emergence of falsehood. To whom does
this faith pertain? It pertains to the 'states', which are the six categories of
existence, the two categories of living and non-living beings, the seven
substances that arise from the combination of soul and matter, and the nine
substances including the soul. This is the right faith that pertains to the nine
substances. What is its special characteristic? It is the seed of the certainty
of the true nature of the soul, which is the pure consciousness of the soul, and
it is the seed of the right faith that destroys the false faith.  The
understanding of these nine substances is the understanding that is free from
the opposite attachment that is like the construction of a boat. It is the
understanding that is free from doubt. Right knowledge is the knowledge that
pertains to the nine substances. It is the seed of the knowledge of the soul,
which is the knowledge of the soul's own consciousness. This knowledge of the
soul's own consciousness is the seed of perfect knowledge.  Right conduct is the
state of equanimity. To what does it pertain? It pertains to the objects of the
senses and mind, which are the sources of pleasure and pain, good and bad. To
whom does it pertain? It pertains to those who have been freed from all other
paths by the power of right faith and right knowledge, and who have firmly
established themselves on the path of liberation. This is the right conduct that
pertains to the external world. It is the seed of the certainty of happiness,
which is the happiness of being free from attachment and the happiness of the
soul. This certainty of happiness is the seed of the infinite happiness of
liberation.  Here, although the two types of certainty and practice have been
explained in order to explain the means and the end, ...

## The Five Astikayas and the Nine Substances  **279**  The essence of this
section is that the **practice of the path to liberation** is the primary focus,
**with the nine substances as its subject**. || 107 ||  Thus, the first sub-
chapter, which deals with the **practice of the path to liberation**, is
concluded with four verses, primarily focusing on the **exposition of the nine
substances** in the second major chapter.  **Hindi Translation:**  The
**Uttanika** further explains the **three jewels** of **Right Faith, Right
Knowledge, and Right Conduct**.  **General Meaning with Anvaya:**
(**Bhavanaam**) The **belief** (**Sahahanam**) in (**Sampattam**) the **Right
Faith** is the **acceptance** (**Tesim**) of (**Adhigamah**) the **knowledge**
(**Naanam**) of the **Right Knowledge**. (**Virudhamgaanam**) The **liberated
souls** (**Visyesu**) in the **objects of the senses** (**Samabhavah**) have
**equanimity** (**Charitam**) which is the **Right Conduct**.  **Specific
Meaning:**  The **five Astikayas** and the **six substances** are differentiated
into **two substances**, **living** and **non-living**. From the **combination**
of the **living** and the **non-living**, the other **seven substances** arise,
such as **influx**, etc. The **practice** of these **nine substances**,
including the **living**, which are the **subject of Right Faith**, is the
**Right Faith**, excluding the **opposite views** that arise from **falsehood**.
This **Right Faith** is only **worthy of being accepted** by the **pure soul**.
This **beautiful certainty** is the **seed** of **Right Faith** and the **self-
awareness** of the **soul** in the **stage of limited knowledge**. This **self-
awareness** is the **seed** of **perfect knowledge**. The **unwavering** and
**true knowledge** of these **nine substances** is the **Right Knowledge**. And,
by the **power** of **Right Faith** and **Right Knowledge**, the **liberated
souls**, who are **distinct** from all other paths, **ascend** the **path to
liberation**. Their **equanimity** or **detachment** towards **auspicious** or
**inauspicious** objects, which are the **causes** of the **arising** of
**pleasure** or **pain** within the **senses** and **mind**, is the **Right
Conduct**. This **practical conduct** is an **external means**, and it is the
**seed** of the **blissful certainty** that arises from the **feeling** of
**detachment**, which is the **nature** of the **Supreme Soul**. This **blissful
certainty** is the **seed** of **imperishable** and **infinite bliss**. Here,
both **certainty** and **practice** are mentioned to explain the
**relationship** between the **means** and the **end**. However, the **essence**
is that the **practice** with the **nine substances as its subject** is the
**primary focus** of the **path to liberation**. || 107 ||  In this way, the
first sub-chapter, which deals with the **practice of the path to liberation**,
is concluded with four verses, primarily focusing on the **exposition of the
nine substances** in the second major chapter.  **Now, the Right Faith in
practice will be explained.**

280 Description of the nine substances, the path to liberation, and the state of
being a Jina, along with the attitude of faith. For a person who has attained
Abhinibodha, the term "darshanika" is appropriate. ||1||  **Explanation:**  As
stated earlier, the Jina-prajnapta (the teachings of the Jinas, the omniscient
and free from attachments), are embraced with faith (saddhamanassa) and a desire
for their essence (bhavadu). These are the karmic afflictions. The term "bhava"
refers to all substances, including the soul (dravya) and its attributes, such
as knowledge, perception, and the ability to perceive the general and specific
nature of all things in the three worlds and three times. This applies to the
bhavyajiva (the soul destined for liberation). When Abhinibodha (the knowledge
of the self) is present, whether it is through intellectual understanding
(matijnana) or through scriptural knowledge (shrutajnana), the term "darshanika"
(one who has attained darshan) is appropriate.  While this sutra touches upon
the state of perfect knowledge (nishchaya samyaktvam), which is characterized by
a pure and unchanging soul and a state of non-dualistic samadhi, it primarily
emphasizes the practical aspect of right conduct (vyavahara samyaktvam), which
is characterized by a desire for the essence of external substances. This is
because the main focus is on what is intended. This is further emphasized by the
fact that this sutra introduces the path to liberation through practical
conduct. ||1||  **Hindi Translation:**  **Uttanika:** Further, we call it
practical right faith.  **Note:** This verse is not found in the commentary of
Shri Amrit Chandraji.  **Anvaya (Word Order) with General Meaning:**  (Evam) As
said before, (jina-prajnapte) the teachings of the Jinas, (bhave) the
substances, (bhavadu) with a desire for their essence, (saddhamanassa) those who
have faith, (purisassa) the bhavyajiva, (abhinibodha) in knowledge,
(darshanasaddho) the term "darshanika", (jutto) is appropriate, (havadhi)
becomes.  **Specific Meaning:**  Here, the substances refer to all things in the
three worlds and three times, including the soul (dravya) and its attributes,
such as knowledge, perception, and the ability to perceive the general and
specific nature of all things. This sutra, while touching upon the state of
perfect knowledge (nishchaya samyaktvam), primarily emphasizes the practical
aspect of right conduct (vyavahara samyaktvam). This is because the main focus
is on what is intended. This is further emphasized by the fact that this sutra
introduces the path to liberation through practical conduct. ||1||  **Names and
Definitions of Substances:**  Jiva (soul), Bhava (existence), Punna (merit),
Pavam (demerit), Asava (afflictions), Samvara (restraint), Nijjara
(destruction), Bandha (bondage), and Moksha (liberation) are the eight
substances. ||108||

truthfulness, non-stealing, chastity, and non-attachment. * **Nirjarā
(Declination):** The gradual decline of karma through the practice of
austerities and meditation. * **Bandha (Bondage):** The binding of the soul to
the cycle of rebirth due to the accumulation of karma. * **Mokṣa (Liberation):**
The complete liberation from the cycle of rebirth, achieved through the complete
eradication of karma.  **Explanation:**  These nine substances are the
fundamental building blocks of the Jain universe. The soul (Jiva) is the primary
entity, while the non-soul (Ajīva) provides the material basis for its
existence. The seven derived substances are the consequences of the interaction
between the soul and the non-soul. They represent the various stages of the
soul's journey towards liberation.  **The Interplay of the Tattvas:**  The
soul's actions (karma) create the conditions for its future experiences.
Positive actions lead to merit (Puṇya), while negative actions lead to demerit
(Pāpa). The inflow of karma (Āsrava) fuels the cycle of rebirth. Through the
practice of control (Samvara), the soul can gradually reduce the inflow of
karma. This leads to the decline of karma (Nirjarā) and ultimately to liberation
(Mokṣa).  **The Goal of Jainism:**  The ultimate goal of Jainism is to achieve
liberation (Mokṣa) by eradicating all karma and attaining a state of pure
consciousness. This is achieved through the practice of non-violence,
truthfulness, non-stealing, chastity, and non-attachment.

## Translation:  **282**  **Description of the Nine Substances and the Path to
Liberation**  **Aasrava** is the result of the attachment and aversion of the
soul, which is the inflow of karmic particles into the soul due to the actions
of the soul. **Samvara** is the restraint of the result of the attachment and
aversion of the soul, which is the restraint of the inflow of karmic particles
into the soul due to the actions of the soul. **Nirjara** is the purification of
the soul, which is the destruction of the potency of karma through the practice
of twelve types of austerities, and the consequent shedding of some of the
accumulated karmic particles. **Bandha** is the attachment of the soul, which is
the result of the attachment and aversion of the soul, and the consequent
binding of the soul with karmic particles. **Moksha** is the liberation of the
soul, which is the complete purification of the soul and the complete separation
of the soul from karmic particles.  **108**  **Commentary:**  Now, the author
describes the names and nature of the nine substances, primarily their names and
secondarily their nature.  The two substances, soul and non-soul, are the
foundation. The two substances, merit and demerit, are derived from them. The
four substances, Aasrava, Samvara, Nirjara, and Bandha, are also derived from
them. Thus, these are the nine well-known substances. Now, the author describes
their nature.  The soul is the substance of knowledge and perception. The non-
soul is the substance of five types, different from the soul, namely, matter,
space, time, motion, and rest. Merit is the good result of the soul, such as
giving, worship, and the six essentials. Merit is the karmic particle of good
nature, such as knowledge and good conduct, which is produced due to merit.
Demerit is the bad result of the soul, such as wrong belief, attachment, and
aversion. Demerit is the karmic particle of bad nature, such as ignorance and
bad conduct, which is produced due to demerit. Aasrava is the result of the
attachment and aversion of the soul, which is the inflow of karmic particles
into the soul due to the actions of the soul. Samvara is the restraint of the
result of the attachment and aversion of the soul, which is the restraint of the
inflow of karmic particles into the soul due to the actions of the soul. Nirjara
is the purification of the soul, which is the destruction of the potency of
karma through the practice of twelve types of austerities, and the consequent
shedding of some of the accumulated karmic particles. Bandha is the attachment
of the soul, which is the result of the attachment and aversion of the soul, and
the consequent binding of the soul with karmic particles. Moksha is the
liberation of the soul, which is the complete purification of the soul and the
complete separation of the soul from karmic particles.  Thus, the meaning of the
sutra is explained.  This is one verse of the sutra, which primarily indicates
the nine substances, soul and non-soul, and their nature.  **Hindi Commentary:**
The author further describes the names and nature of the nine substances,
primarily their names and secondarily their nature.  **Meaning with Anvaya:**
(Soul and non-soul) Soul and non-soul are the substances. (Merit and demerit)
Merit and demerit are the substances derived from them. (Aasrava, Samvara,
Nirjara, and Bandha) The four substances, Aasrava, Samvara, Nirjara, and Bandha,
are also derived from them. Thus, these are the nine well-known substances. Now,
the author describes their nature.

The nine substances (**dravya**) are: **Panchaastikaya** (five categories of
non-living matter), **Jiva** (living being), **Punnya** (merit), **Papa**
(demerit), **Asrava** (influx), **Samvara** (restriction), **Nirjara**
(effusion), **Bandha** (bondage), and **Moksha** (liberation).  **Explanation:**
* **Jiva:** The living being, characterized by the ability to perceive and know.
* **Ajiva:** The five categories of non-living matter, distinct from the Jiva,
such as matter, space, time, motion, and rest. * **Punnya:** Merit, a state of
mind characterized by good intentions and actions, such as generosity and
worship. It manifests as **dravya punnya**, a collection of **pudgala** (matter)
particles with auspicious qualities. * **Papa:** Demerit, a state of mind
characterized by negative intentions and actions, such as false beliefs and
anger. It manifests as **dravya papa**, a collection of **pudgala** particles
with inauspicious qualities. * **Asrava:** Influx, the flow of negative karmic
tendencies (**raga**, **dvesha**, **moha**) into the Jiva. It manifests as
**dravya asrava**, the influx of karmic matter into the Jiva. * **Samvara:**
Restriction, the cessation of the influx of karmic tendencies. It manifests as
**dravya samvara**, the cessation of the influx of karmic matter. * **Nirjara:**
Effusion, the gradual shedding of accumulated karma through **tapas**
(austerities). It manifests as **dravya nirjara**, the shedding of karmic
matter. * **Bandha:** Bondage, the attachment of the Jiva to karmic matter due
to negative tendencies. It manifests as **dravya bandha**, the entanglement of
the Jiva with karmic matter. * **Moksha:** Liberation, the complete detachment
of the Jiva from karmic matter, leading to the realization of the pure soul. It
manifests as **dravya moksha**, the complete separation of the Jiva from karmic
matter.  This concludes the explanation of the nine substances in this text. The
next section will discuss the **Jiva** in detail.

## Chapter 284: Description of the Path to Liberation through the Nine
Substances and the Nature of the Soul  This is a description of the nature of
the soul, the path to liberation through the nine substances. Souls in the cycle
of existence are of two types: those bound to the cycle and those liberated.
They are also characterized by their function and by their association with
bodies.  **Verse 109:** Souls in the cycle of existence are bound and liberated,
and they are all characterized by consciousness. They are also characterized by
their function, which is the result of consciousness. Those in the cycle of
existence are associated with bodies, while those liberated are not.
**Explanation:** This is a statement about the nature of the soul. Souls are of
two types: (1) those bound to the cycle of existence, which are impure, and (2)
those liberated, which are pure. Both are inherently conscious and can be
recognized by their function, which is the result of consciousness. Those bound
to the cycle of existence are associated with bodies, while those liberated are
not.  **Commentary:** This chapter discusses the nature of the soul in detail.
The first verse introduces the topic of the soul, stating that souls are of two
types: those bound to the cycle of existence and those liberated. The next four
verses discuss the different types of beings in the cycle of existence, based on
their senses. The following three verses discuss the three types of beings with
incomplete senses. The next four verses discuss the four types of realms (hell,
animal, human, and god) and the five senses. The next two verses discuss the
nature of karma and the consequences of actions. The final verse concludes the
discussion of the soul and introduces the topic of non-soul substances.   This
chapter, with its fifteen verses, covers the second chapter of the second part
of the text. It discusses the nature of the soul and how souls are different
from each other. It also discusses the different types of beings in the cycle of
existence and the consequences of their actions.

The five astikayas, beginning with the first, 285 are also completed. There are
two types of chetanas. Both are chetanatmaka, karma-chetanatmaka, karma-phala-
chetanatmaka. Samsarin are shuddha-chetanatmaka, mukta. Ubaogalakkhana is also
upayogalakshana. The use of the soul is in accordance with the awareness, the
muktas are of the nature of knowledge and vision. The samsarin are of the nature
of impure use, which is the cause of destruction. Deha-deha-praveechara-deha-
deha-praveechara are deha-praveechara with a body opposite to the true nature of
the soul, without a body, they are siddha. This is the meaning of the sutra. ||
109 || Thus, the first place has been reached in the form of a gatha indicating
the authority of the jiva. Further information about the statement - Further,
the authority of the jiva substance is stated in fifteen gathas - Among these
fifteen gathas, the main gathasutra is "jiva sansartya" etc., which indicates
the authority of the jiva substance. Then, there are four gathas in the order of
"puthavi tha" etc., mainly about the five stationary one-sensory beings,
starting with the earth body. Then, there are three gathas in the order of
"sambukk" etc., mainly about the explanation of the three vikalendriya. Then,
there are eight gathas from "suranar" etc., stating the four types of
panchendriya related to naraki, tiryanch, manushya and devagati. Then, there are
two gathas from "chha hi indiyani" etc., mainly about the feeling of difference,
the doership of good and bad, and the experience of it. After that, there is one
sutra from "evam adhigamm" etc., mainly about the contraction of the jiva
substance and the beginning of the jiva substance. In this way, the community of
the second internal authority is said through six places in fifteen gathas.
Hindi Ta. - Uththani-ka - Further, the nature of the jiva is stated. General
meaning with anuvaya - (Jiva) The community of jivas (duviha) is of two types
(sansartya) Samsari who live in the world (nivyada) Siddha who have attained
liberation (vedanappagga) These are chetanmayi, (uvaogalakkhana) They are also
of the nature of use (b) and (dehadeha-praveechara) They are body-enjoyers and
body-less. Those who are samsari are with a body, and those who are siddha are
without a body. Special meaning - The commentator has made this meaning by
giving two special qualities of chetanatmaka, that these samsari jivas are
impure chetanmayi and the liberated jivas are pure chetanmayi. There are two
types of impure chetana - karma-chetana and karma-phala-chetana. The experience
of doing work with attachment and aversion is karma-chetana. And the experience
of being happy and unhappy is karma-phala-chetana. The experience of the pure
knowledge and bliss nature of the soul is pure knowledge-chetana. Within the
quality of awareness,

## 286 **Subject:** Description of the Path to Liberation  The use of
**parinaama** (transformation) is mentioned. It is also said,
"**Chaitanyaanuvidhaayi parinaama upayogaha**" (Transformation is the means for
the attainment of consciousness). For liberated beings, only **kevalajnaana**
(omniscience) and **kevaladarshana** (omniscient perception) are the means,
whereas worldly beings have means that are impure or in the form of
**kshayopashama** (diminishing of karmas), such as **matijnaana** (knowledge).
Worldly beings are possessors of bodies, contrary to the **aatmatattva** (soul
principle) which is devoid of a body, whereas **siddh** (liberated) beings are
devoid of all types of bodies. || 109 ||  In this way, the first section of the
information about the **jivaadhikaara** (rights of the soul) in the form of a
**gaatha** (verse) is complete.  This is about the five types of bodies:
**prithvikaayika** (earth body), **apkaayika** (water body), **tejakaayika**
(fire body), **vaayukaayika** (air body), and **vanaspatikaayika** (plant body).
**Verse 110:**  The bodies of earth, water, fire, air, and plants are associated
with living beings. They give rise to a lot of **moha** (delusion) and
**sparsha** (touch) to the living beings residing in them, even though they are
numerous. || 110 ||  **Explanation:**  **Prithvikaaya**, **apkaaya**,
**tejakaaya**, **vaayukaaya**, and **vanaspatikaaya** - these **pudgala
parinaama** (transformations of matter) are associated with living beings due to
**bandha** (bondage). Due to the difference in **avaantara jaati** (sub-
species), even though they are numerous, they all (**pudgala parinaama**) are
the cause of the formation of the external **sparshendriya** (sense of touch)
for living beings who have **kshayopashama** (diminishing of karmas) in the
**sparshendriyaavaraana** (covering of the sense of touch). Because they are
primarily driven by **karmaphala chetana** (consciousness of the fruits of
karma), they give rise to **sparshopaalabdhi** (perception of touch) that is
full of **moha** (delusion). || 110 ||  **Meaning:**  (**Prithvi**) Earth body,
(**udakam**) water body, (**jala kaaya**) (**agni**) fire body, (**vaayu**) air
body (**cha**) and (**vanaspati**) plant body (**kaaya**) - these bodies are
(**jivaasanśrita**) associated with living beings. (**Bahuka: api te**) Even
though they are numerous (in comparison to the sub-species), they all
(**teshaam**) give (**khala**) truly (**mohabhulaam**) a lot of delusion
(**sparsham dadati**) touch (i.e., they are the cause of the knowledge of
touch).  **Commentary:**  (From the differences in worldly beings) there is a
mention of the five types of bodies: earth body, water body, fire body, air
body, and plant body. These **pudgala parinaama** (transformations of matter)
are associated with living beings due to **bandha** (bondage). Even though they
are numerous due to the difference in **avaantara jaati** (sub-species), they
all (**pudgala parinaama**) are the cause of the formation of the external
**sparshendriya** (sense of touch) for living beings who have **kshayopashama**
(diminishing of karmas) in the **sparshendriyaavaraana** (covering of the sense
of touch). Because they are primarily driven by **karmaphala chetana**
(consciousness of the fruits of karma), they give rise to **sparshopaalabdhi**
(perception of touch) that is full of **moha** (delusion). || 110 ||
**Summary:**  This section discusses the five types of bodies associated with
living beings: earth, water, fire, air, and plants. These bodies are a result of
**karma** (actions) and are the cause of **moha** (delusion) and **sparsha**
(touch) for the living beings residing in them.   **Note:** The text uses
several Jain terms, including **parinaama**, **kevalajnaana**,
**kevaladarshana**, **kshayopashama**, **matijnaana**, **aatmatattva**,
**siddh**, **jivaadhikaara**, **gaatha**, **prithvikaayika**, **apkaayika**,
**tejakaayika**, **vaayukaayika**, **vanaspatikaayika**, **pudgala parinaama**,
**bandha**, **avaantara jaati**, **sparshendriya**, **sparshendriyaavaraana**,
**karmaphala chetana**, and **sparshopaalabdhi**. These terms are specific to
Jain philosophy and are used to explain the nature of the soul, liberation, and
the cycle of birth and death.

## Translation:  **Verse 110:**  The essence of the self is luminous and
radiant, but due to the lack of contemplation of this essence, a being, driven
by the desire for limited pleasures, becomes attached to the objects of the
sense of touch and acquires the karma called "Ekaindriya-jati" (one-sense-
category). This karma, at the time of its arising, leads to the cessation of the
sense of touch and the being evolves through the knowledge of the objects of
touch. This is the meaning of the sutra.  **Verse 111:**  There are three types
of stationary beings: those with earth-bodies, water-bodies, and plant-bodies.
There are also beings with air-bodies and fire-bodies. These beings are all
fearful. They are devoid of mental transformations and are known as one-sense
beings.  **Commentary:**  This verse explains that beings with air and fire
bodies are also fearful, even though they are not stationary like earth, water,
and plant beings. This is because they are seen to move in the context of the
five stationary beings. However, they are not fearful because of mental
transformations, but because of their one-sense nature. They are devoid of
mental transformations and are known as one-sense beings.  **Note:**  The terms
"Ekaindriya-jati" and "Pancha-astika" are specific to Jainism and refer to
categories of beings based on their senses and their karmic attachments.

## Translation:  **288**  **Description of the Nine Substances and the Path to
Liberation**  Although the fire and air-bodied beings appear to move in
practical terms, due to their dependence on the arising of the karma called
"stationary," they are in fact stationary in essence. || 111 ||  **Hindi
Translation:**  The text shows that in practical terms, fire and air-bodied
beings can be called "mobile" due to their movement.  **General Meaning with
Anvaya:**  (Tesu) Among these five, (ti sthavaratanujoga) three are stationary,
namely earth, water, and plant-bodied, due to their fixed bodies. (Ya) And
(anilaanalakayiya) air-bodied and fire-bodied beings (tasa) are called mobile
beings. (Eindiya jiva) It is (neya) to be known that one-sensed beings
(manparinamvirhida) are devoid of the transformation of the mind.  **Special
Meaning:**  The soul, which is distinct from the arising of the karma called
"stationary" and inseparable from the infinite knowledge and other qualities, is
devoid of experience in the beings bound by the karma called "stationary." Due
to their dependence on the arising of this karma, although fire and air-bodied
beings appear to move in practical terms, they are in fact stationary in
essence. || 111 ||  * The earth-bodied and others are one-sensed due to the
absence of the mind and the cessation of the covering of the sense of touch, and
the arising of the covering of the remaining senses. || 112 ||  **Anvaya:**
(Ete) These (prithivakayikadya) earth-bodied and others (panchavidha) five types
of (jivanikaya) life forms are (manah parinamvirhita) devoid of the
transformation of the mind, (ekendriya) one-sensed beings (bhanita) (sarvgyane)
are called.  **Commentary:**  This is the rule for the one-sensed nature of the
earth-bodied and other five types of beings.  The earth-bodied and other beings
are one-sensed and devoid of mind due to the cessation of the covering of the
sense of touch and the arising of the covering of the remaining senses and the
arising of the covering of the mind. || 112 ||  * The fire-bodied and air-bodied
beings are called mobile in practical terms due to their movement, but in
essence, they are stationary due to their dependence on the karma called
"stationary." (Although they move in practical terms, they are still
stationary).

## Pancastikaya Prabhruta 289  **The text establishes that the five types of
beings, starting with the Earth-bodied, are all one-sensed.** These five types
of beings, starting with the Earth-bodied, are directly perceived as living
beings. How are they? They are devoid of mental modifications, not only devoid
of mental modifications but also one-sensed. In what context are they said to be
one-sensed? They are one-sensed due to the destruction and cessation of the
obstacles to vigor and the covering of the sense of touch, and due to the
arising of the covering of the other senses, or due to the non-arising of the
covering of the other senses.   **Although this sutra, with its definitive
statement, does not indicate the existence of the five categories of beings,
starting with the Earth-bodied, as separate from pure existence, yet according
to the practical point of view, due to the arising of the karma called "one-
sensed category," which is associated with impure mental defilements like
attachment, etc., and devoid of pure mental self-awareness, these beings become
one-sensed, even though they are devoid of mind.**  **This is an illustration
and explanation of the consciousness of the one-sensed beings.**  **Just as
eggs, embryos, and humans in a state of unconsciousness are one-sensed, so too
are these beings.**  **Even though we see intelligent activity in eggs, embryos,
and unconscious humans, we still know that they are living beings. Similarly,
because the one-sensed beings also exhibit intelligent activity, we know that
they are living beings.**

## Translation:  **290** **Description of the Nine Substances and the Path to
Liberation**  **Anvayaartha (Meaning with Word Order):**
(**Andeshupravardhamanaha**) Creatures growing in eggs, (**Garbhasthaha**)
creatures residing in the womb (**Cha**) and (**Murchagataha; Manushaha**)
humans in a state of unconsciousness (**Yadrushaha**) like these
(**Buddhipoorvak Vyapaar Rahith Hote Huye Bhi**) beings who are devoid of
conscious activity, (**Tadrushaha**) similarly (**Ekendiyaha Jivaaha**) one-
sensed beings (**Jneyaaha**) are to be known.  **Tika (Commentary):** This is a
statement of an example regarding the existence of consciousness in one-sensed
beings.  **Explanation:** Just as we do not see conscious activity in creatures
residing in eggs, in the womb, or in a state of unconsciousness, yet we are
certain of their existence as living beings, similarly, we are certain of the
existence of one-sensed beings as living beings, because the absence of
conscious activity is the same in both. ||113||  **Santa (Explanation):** Now,
to illustrate the existence of consciousness in earth-bodied beings and one-
sensed beings, it is said: "Creatures growing in eggs, residing in the womb, and
humans in a state of unconsciousness, are like those who are devoid of conscious
activity; similarly, one-sensed beings are to be known." Just as we know the
existence of consciousness in egg-born creatures by observing the growth of
their bodies, even though they do not engage in external activities, and we know
the absence of consciousness in the dead by observing their lifelessness, so it
is with one-sensed beings. The meaning here is: Although the soul, in its true
nature, is independent and possesses infinite knowledge and happiness, it
becomes attached to the pleasures of the senses, which are dependent on external
objects, due to ignorance. The actions it performs in this state of ignorance
bind it, causing it to experience suffering as a one-sensed being, similar to
egg-born creatures. ||113||  Thus, the explanation of the five stationary
beings, primarily through four verses, has reached the second stage.  **Hindi Ta
(Hindi Translation):** Uththānika (Introduction): Further, to explain that
earth-bodied beings and one-sensed beings possess the quality of consciousness,
an example is given.  **Anvaya Sahith Samaanyārtha (General Meaning with Word
Order):** (**Jarisaaya**) Just as (**Andeshupravartunta**) creatures grow in
eggs, (**Galbhattha**) reside in the womb (**Ya**) and (**Muchchagaya**) humans
in a state of unconsciousness (**Maanusha**) live, (**Tarisaaya**) similarly
(**Egendriya Jivaa**) one-sensed beings (**Jneyaa**) are to be known.
**Visheshārtha (Specific Meaning):** Just as we do not see the creatures inside
eggs, the animals in the womb, or the humans in a state of unconsciousness
engaging in conscious activity, so it is with these one-sensed beings. This
means that we should know that even though we do not see egg-born creatures
engaging in external activities, they possess consciousness within. The same
applies to animals and humans in the womb. The growth of the womb indicates the
presence of consciousness. A person in a state of unconsciousness can regain
consciousness immediately. Similarly, we should know that there is consciousness
within one-sensed beings.

## Five Astikayas and Beyond  **291**  It is understood that when a being in the
womb, an egg, or in a state of unconsciousness becomes lifeless, i.e., does not
grow or its bodily functions cease, then it is assumed that the soul is no
longer present. Similarly, when a one-sense being becomes lifeless or inert, it
becomes devoid of life and consciousness. It is worth noting here that this
soul, by its very nature, is endowed with infinite knowledge and infinite bliss,
independent of anything else. However, due to its attachment to the pleasures of
the senses, it binds karma, which, upon its fruition, leads the soul to become a
one-sense being, like an egg-born, and plunges it into suffering. || 113 ||
**The second section, primarily through four verses, completes the discussion of
the five stationary beings.**  **Concerning the two-sense beings:**  **114**
*Shank, conch, oyster, and footless worms, which perceive taste and touch, are
two-sense beings.*  **Explanation:** This is an explanation of the types of two-
sense beings.  Due to the destruction or cessation of the coverings of the touch
and taste senses, and the emergence of the coverings of the remaining senses, or
the non-emergence of the coverings of the remaining senses, these beings (like
conch, etc.) who perceive touch and taste become two-sense beings without a
mind. || 114 ||  **Commentary:**  Here, the different types of two-sense beings
are described. Shank, conch, oyster, and footless worms are the agents who
perceive both touch and taste. Therefore, these beings are two-sense beings.
For example, the pure soul, distinct from the two-sense nature, and distinct
from the two-fold knowledge and perception, is the pure soul-body. This soul-
body, due to its inherent nature, is devoid of the pleasure of taste, which is
characterized by eternal bliss. The two-sense beings, who experience the
pleasure of taste and touch through their senses, acquire the karma of the two-
sense category. When this karma ripens, the coverings of the touch and taste
senses are destroyed or cease, and the coverings of the remaining senses emerge
or do not emerge. As a result, the two-sense beings become devoid of a mind. ||

(**Beindriya**) with two senses.  **Specific Meaning:** With absolute certainty,
this being is distinct from the form of the two-sense being and is inseparable
from perfect knowledge and perfect vision, i.e., it is pure and completely the
body of existence. By the feeling of such a pure soul, one does not experience
the enjoyment of the single characteristic, blissful, delicious taste, but
rather, the beings who are engrossed in the enjoyment of the taste of objects,
qualities, and flavors like touch and smell, etc., have formed a bond of karma
called the name of the two-sense category. At the time of the arising of that
karma, due to the benefit of the destruction and pacification of the karma
called the covering of the sense of touch and the covering of knowledge, the
karma in the form of the covering of the remaining senses arises, and when the
karma in the form of the covering of the mind arises, these beings are two-sense
beings without a mind. ||114||  **Indication of the Types of Three-Sense

## Translation:  **Verse 115:**  This verse explains the characteristics of
three-sense beings. Creatures like ants, bees, wasps, and scorpions perceive
touch, taste, and smell. Therefore, they are called three-sense beings.   The
reason for this is that they have experienced the supreme bliss of liberation,
which is characterized by pure knowledge, perception, and the nature of the
soul. This bliss is like nectar, and it protects them from the suffering caused
by the objects of touch, taste, and smell. However, they have still bound
themselves to the karma of the three-sense beings, which is dependent on the
arising of this karma.   This karma is overcome by the destruction and
pacification of the coverings on the senses of touch, taste, and smell. When the
coverings on the remaining senses arise, or when the covering on the mind
arises, these three-sense beings become mindless. This is the meaning of the
verse.  **Verse 116:**  This verse explains the characteristics of four-sense
beings. Creatures like flies, mosquitoes, bees, and butterflies perceive touch,
taste, smell, and sight. Therefore, they are called four-sense beings.  The
reason for this is that they have overcome the coverings on the senses of touch,
taste, smell, and sight. When the covering on the sense of hearing arises, or
when the covering on the mind arises, these four-sense beings become mindless.
This is the meaning of the verse.

##  294 This is information about the types of four-sense beings.  Due to the
destruction and pacification of the coverings of the touch, taste, smell, and
sight senses, and the arising of the covering of the hearing sense and the
arising of the covering of the mind, these beings (like flies, etc.) who know
touch, taste, smell, and color are four-sense beings without a mind. ||116||
**Commentary:** Now, the different types of four-sense beings are shown. The
purpose is that flies, mosquitoes, bees, bumblebees, moths, etc. know touch,
taste, smell, and color, and therefore they are four-sense beings. For example,
those who are averse to the drinking of the nectar of happiness that arises from
the knowledge of non-attachment, self-awareness, and the feeling of non-
attachment, and who are attached to the experiences of happiness in the objects
of the senses of touch, taste, smell, and sight, etc., bind the karma called
"four-sense being." Due to the ripening of this karma, and due to the
destruction and pacification of the coverings of the senses of touch, taste,
smell, and sight, and the arising of the covering of the hearing sense and the
covering of the mind, they become four-sense beings without a mind. This is the
meaning. ||166||  Thus, the explanation of the beings with impaired senses is
completed in three verses, mainly.  **Hindi Commentary:** **Uttanika:** Now, the
different types of four-sense beings are explained.  **General Meaning with
Anvaya:** (Uins) Flies [Masay] mosquitoes, [Makkhi] flies, [Madhukari] bees,
[Bhamra] bumblebees, [Patangamadiya] moths, etc. [Rupan] know color, [Rasan]
taste, [Cha] and [Gandhan] smell, [Pun] and [Phasan] touch, [Ananti] know, [Te
Vi] they are four-sense beings.  **Specific Meaning:** Those beings who have a
false view, are averse to the drinking of the nectar of happiness that arises
from the knowledge of non-attachment, self-awareness, and the feeling of non-
attachment, and who are attached to the experiences of happiness in the objects
of the senses of touch, taste, smell, and sight, etc., bind the karma called
"four-sense being." Due to the ripening of this karma, and due to the
destruction and pacification of the coverings of the senses of touch, taste,
smell, and sight, and the arising of the covering of the hearing sense and the
covering of the mind, they become four-sense beings without a mind. This is the
meaning. ||116||  In this way, the explanation of the beings with impaired
senses is completed in three verses, mainly.  **Information about the types of
five-sense beings:** Suras, humans, narakas, and animals, who know color, taste,
touch, smell, and sound, who live in water, on land, and in the air, are strong
five-sense beings. ||117||

295 Those who know color, taste, touch, smell and sound
(surenaranarakatiryancha) are the gods, humans, hell-beings and animals
(jalacharasthalacharakachara) who are strong, five-sensed beings (balinah
panchendriya jeevah). ||177||  When the coverings of the senses of touch, taste,
smell, sight and hearing are destroyed or subdued, and the covering of the mind
arises, then those who know color, taste, smell, touch and sound are five-sensed
beings without minds (amanaska). Some (five-sensed beings) become mindful
(samanaska) when the covering of the mind is also destroyed or subdued. Among
them, gods, humans and hell-beings are mindful, while animals are of both types
(i.e. mindless and mindful). ||117|| Commentary: This is an explanation of the
types of five-sensed beings. Due to the destruction or subduing of the coverings
of the senses of touch, taste, smell, sight and hearing, the covering of the
mind arises, and those who know color, taste, smell, touch and sound are five-
sensed beings without minds. Some (five-sensed beings) become mindful when the
covering of the mind is also destroyed or subdued. Among them, gods, humans and
hell-beings are mindful, while animals are of both types (i.e. mindless and
mindful). ||117||

## 296  **Description of the Nine Substances and the Path to Liberation**
[**Water-dwelling, Land-dwelling, and Sky-dwelling**] Those who are water-
dwelling, land-dwelling, and sky-dwelling [**Strong**] such strong [**Beings**]
beings [**Color, Taste, Touch, Smell, and Sound**] are able to perceive color,
taste, touch, smell, and sound [**Five Senses, Senses**].  **Special Meaning:**
The commentator has explained this meaning as follows: Among the lower animals,
some have very strong senses, such as the crocodile among water-dwelling
creatures, the octopus among land-dwelling creatures, and the vulture among sky-
dwelling creatures. Those beings with external souls who are attached to the
pleasures of the senses, which are opposite to the unchanging bliss of pure
consciousness that arises from meditation on the flawless Supreme Soul, bind the
karma of the five senses, known as the "five-sense category." Upon its arising,
they acquire the karma of "vigor-hindrance" and the karma of covering the senses
of touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing. Due to the destruction and
pacification of these covering karmas, they gain the benefit of the five senses.
Some beings, upon the arising of the karma that covers knowledge through the
mind, become devoid of the five senses and the mind. They are then incapable of
learning, conversing, or receiving teachings. Some beings, due to the
destruction and pacification of the karma that covers the nine senses, become
five-sensed beings with a mind. Among these five-sensed beings, hell-beings,
humans, and gods are all "with a mind." The five-sensed lower animals are of two
types: "with a mind" and "without a mind." Those with one to four senses are all
"without a mind."  Someone might question: "Do beings without a mind also have
knowledge of destruction and pacification? And isn't the mind the thought that
arises from destruction and pacification? If this thought exists in beings
without a mind, why are they called 'without a mind'?" The commentator answers:
"Beings without a mind do not have the knowledge of the pervasiveness of cause
and effect. They cannot contemplate beforehand, in every situation, that doing
this will lead to this benefit and that doing that will lead to this harm.
Beings without a mind act according to their nature, without considering benefit
or harm. For example, the ant's cleverness in relation to smell and food, etc.,
is due to its natural disposition. It cannot contemplate or understand other
matters. The mind has the power to indirectly know the Supreme Soul and other
principles through the knowledge of pervasiveness, which is the knowledge of the
three worlds and three times. Therefore, it is similar to pure knowledge."
**117**  ... This is a conclusion regarding the relationship of the four paths
of existence with the beings described according to their differences in senses.
**118**  ... Gods have four bodies, humans are the earth of karma and enjoyment,
and lower animals are numerous and diverse, dwelling on the earth.

The four types of beings are:  * **Devas (Gods)**: They are of four types:
Bhavanavasi, Vyantara, Jyotishka, and Vaimanika. * **Manushya (Humans)**: They
are of two types: Karmabhoomij and Bhogabhoomij. * **Tiryanch (Animals)**: They
are of many types, based on their physical forms and senses: Prithvi, Shambook,
Yook, Uddesh, Jalachar, Urag, Pakshi, Parisarp, Chatushpad, etc. * **Naraka
(Hell beings)**: They are of seven types, based on the type of hell they
inhabit: Ratnaprababhoomij, Sharkaraprababhoomij, Valukaprababhoomij,
Pankaprababhoomij, Dhoomaprababhoomij, Tamasprababhoomij, and Maha-
tamasprababhoomij.  Devas, Manushya, and Naraka all have five senses. However,
Tiryanch can have one, two, three, four, or five senses.

## 298 ## Navapadaartha - Mokshamarga Varnan  **The meaning of the sutra is:**
Those beings who are devoid of the feeling of being a Siddha, or devoid of the
feeling of their own pure soul being like a Siddha, have accumulated karma
called "Chaturgati" (four states of existence). Due to the ripening of this
karma, they are born in the states of Devas (gods) and others. || 118 ||
**Hindi Ta. -** Uththānikā - Further, the Jina beings are said to be of four
states of existence, based on the difference between one-sense beings and
others.  **General meaning with Anvaya:** (Deva) Beings in the Deva state
(Chaunnaikaaya) are of four types, in four groups. (Pun) And (Manuya) humans
(Kammabhogabhoomiyaa) are those who have the earth of karma and the earth of
enjoyment. (Tiriya) Beings in the Tiryanch state (Bahuppayaara) are of many
kinds (Neradyaa) beings in hell (Pudhavibheyaagada) are the proof of the
difference in the earth.  **Specific meaning:** There are four groups of Devas:
Bhavanvaasi, Vyantar, Jyotishi, and Vaimanik. There are two types of humans:
those who are born in the earth of enjoyment and those who are born in the earth
of karma. Tiryanch beings are of many types. There are five one-sense Tiryanch
beings like earth, etc. There are two-sense Tiryanch beings like Shambuk, etc.,
three-sense Tiryanch beings like fish, etc., and four-sense Tiryanch beings like
ants, etc. These are the three types of Vikalatrai Tiryanch beings. There are
two-legged, four-legged, etc., five-sense Tiryanch beings that move in water, on
land, and in the sky. There are seven earths: Ratna, Sharkara, Baluka, Pank,
Dhum, Tam, and Mahatam. There are seven hells in these earths, and the beings
who reside in them are called Naraki. The meaning of the sutra here is that
beings who are devoid of the feeling of being a Siddha, or devoid of the feeling
of their own pure soul being like a Siddha, have accumulated karma called
"Chaturgati" (four states of existence). Due to the ripening of this karma,
these beings are born in the states of Devas and others. || 118 ||
**Gatyayurnaamodayanirvrittatvad
devaatvaadiinaamanatmasvabhavatvodyotanametat.**  **-**  **Kheene puvva-
nibaddhe gadi naame aause cha te vi khalu. Papunnanti ya annam gadi maausam
saless vaasa.** || 119 || **Ksheene purvanibaddhe gatinaamni ayushi cha te'pi
khalu. Praapnuvanti chaanyaam gatim aayushkam swaleshyavashaat.** || 119 ||
**-**  The specific type of karma called "Gati" (state of existence) and the
specific type of karma called "Ayus" (lifespan) that are accumulated by beings
gradually diminish. Even so, the seed of their inclination towards the karma of
another state of existence and another lifespan, which is fueled by their
attachment to the kshayaas (passions), remains. Therefore, they attain another
state of existence and another lifespan that is appropriate to that seed. Thus,
even though the "Gati" and "Ayus" karmas are gradually diminishing and being
renewed again and again, these beings, who are inherently devoid of the nature
of the soul, continue to be bound by these karmas and wander in samsara, unaware
of their true nature. || 119 ||

## Translation:  **Pancastikaya Prabhrut**  299 Anvayarth - (Purvanibaddhe)
Previously bound (Gatinamni Ayushi Cha)  Gatinam karma and Ayush karma (Kshine)
being exhausted (Te Api)  those Jivas (Swaleshyavashat)  due to their Leshya
(Khalu)  indeed (Anyam Gatim Ayushkam Cha)  other Gati and Ayush (Prapnuvanti)
they attain.  **Tika** - Here, it is shown that Devatvaadi (divine states) are
not of the nature of the Atma (soul) because they are produced by the arising of
Gatinam karma and Ayush karma.  Jivas, whose fruits begin, experience the
exhaustion of certain Gatinam karma and certain Ayush karma respectively. Even
after this, they have Leshya, which is the seed of other Gati and other Ayush,
in the form of Kshaya-Anuranjit Yogapravritti (the tendency towards action
influenced by passions). (Meaning, Leshya is the cause of the binding of other
Gatinam karma and other Ayush karma), therefore, they attain other Gati and
other Ayush according to it. Thus, even after attaining exhaustion and non-
exhaustion, the newly arising Gatinam karma and Ayush karma (in the form of a
stream), although they are not of the nature of the Atma, remain with the Jivas
for a long time. Therefore, Jivas who do not experience the Atma, continue to
cycle (meaning, Jivas who do not experience the Atma wander in the world). ||

## 300  **Navapadartha-Mokshamarg** describes the impure states of Vibhava. Or,
anyone who argues that there are no other states of a being in the world, that a
god dies and remains a god, a human dies and remains a human, their statement is
refuted.  **General Meaning with Anvaya:** [Puvanibaddhe] Bound in the past
[Gadinama] by the Karma called Gatinam [Cha] and [Ause] by the Karma called Ayu
[Khine] when they are destroyed, [Tevi] those beings [Khalu] truly [Salesvasa]
under the influence of their own Leshya [Annam] other [Gadim] Gati [Ya] and
[Aussam] Ayu [Papunnanti] attain.  **Specific Meaning:** These worldly beings
are born again and again, bound by different Gati and Ayu, under the influence
of their own results. Krishna, Neel, Kapoot, Peet, Padam, Shukul are the six
Leshyas. Their nature is described in detail in Shri Gommatsar, like: "Chandon
Muchhai Veram Bhandansileo Ya Dhammadayarhiyo. Dutttho Na Ya Edi Vasan
Lakkhanameyam Tu Kinhass. ||509||"  **Meaning:** Those who are fierce, with
intense anger, who do not give up hatred, whose nature is to argue and fight,
who are devoid of compassion and righteousness, who are wicked, who are not
under the control of a Guru or anyone else, these are the characteristics of
those with Krishna Leshya.  This is a spiritual text, so it is not described in
detail, but we will write briefly: "Kashayo Dayanuranjita Yogapravritti:
Leshya". This is the characteristic of Leshya. That is, the tendency of the
Yogas colored by the arising of Kashayas is called Leshya. This is the seed of
the binding of the auspicious and inauspicious Gatinam Karma and Ayukarma,
therefore it is appropriate to destroy Leshya. The way to do this is to have the
feeling that "I am different from the four Kashayas of anger, pride, deceit, and
greed, and I am not different from the four infinite qualities of infinite
vision, infinite knowledge, infinite happiness, and infinite power. I am a being
with the nature of the Supreme Soul." Then the arising of Kashayas is destroyed.
For this feeling, the activities of the mind, speech, and body are abandoned,
whether they are auspicious or inauspicious. In the same way, when the three
Yogas are absent, then the Leshya, which is the tendency of the Yogas colored by
the arising of Kashayas, is also destroyed. With the absence of Leshya, the
Gatinam Karma and Ayukarma are also absent, then the benefit of Moksha is
attained, which is full of the indestructible, infinite qualities of happiness,
etc. This is the meaning of the Sutra. ||119||

This is the conclusion of the previously mentioned categories of living beings.
These living beings are said to be those who are dependent on the body, i.e.,
those who have a body. Those who are without a body are the Siddhas, the
Bhavyas, and the Abhavyas.   These are all the categories of living beings
mentioned earlier. All of them are dependent on the body, except for the
Siddhas, who are pure souls without a body.  Since they are dependent on the
body, the Samsaris (those who are still in the cycle of birth and death) are of
two types: Bhavyas and Abhavyas. They are called Bhavyas and Abhavyas based on
whether they have the power to attain their pure form or not.    The Bhavyas are
like a mung bean that can be cooked, and the Abhavyas are like a mung bean that
cannot be cooked. The Bhavyas have the power to attain their pure form, while
the Abhavyas do not.

The description of the path to liberation through the nine substances:
Continuing the discussion of the nature of living beings, which was previously
mentioned, we now explain the difference between worldly and liberated beings by
condensing the explanation.  General meaning with analysis: [These] these
[living beings] groups of living beings [body knowledge] are said to be those
who take refuge in the body, that is, those who act through the body. [Without
body] those who are without body are [liberated]. [Worldly] worldly beings are
of two types: [worthy] worthy and [unworthy] unworthy.  Specific meaning: If we
look at it from the perspective of the definitive principle, all living beings
are possessors of the pure self-nature, they are masters of the body of pure
consciousness, and they are devoid of bodies born from karma. From the
perspective of the practical principle, those who are embodied are worldly, and
those who are disembodied are liberated. Liberated beings have attained the pure
self directly. Among worldly beings, some are worthy and some are unworthy.
Those who possess the power of purification in the form of the manifestation of
qualities like pure knowledge are worthy. Those who do not possess the power of
purification in the form of manifestation are unworthy. For example, mung beans
that are fit for cooking and mung beans that are not fit for cooking, or gold
ore and worthless ore. The former has the potential for manifestation of its
nature, while the latter does not, although the nature of mung bean and gold is
present in both. The power to become pure manifests at the time of accepting
right faith in those who possess it. But in those who do not possess that power,
it remains eternally impure, as it has been from the beginning.  Thus, the
fourth stage is completed, primarily focusing on the explanation of the five
senses in the first four verses.  Here, the five senses are the characteristic
feature, so it is also important to understand the explanation of one-sense
beings, etc., from the section of the verse "tiria bahuppayara" mentioned
earlier. This characteristic feature is illustrated with an example. For
example, if someone says, "Protect the ghee from crows," it also implies that
the ghee should be protected from cats, etc.  This refutes the view that the
body is the only characteristic of a living being. For the senses are not the
living being, nor are the bodies, which are of six types. What is present in
them as knowledge, that is what they consider to be the living being.

The five senses and the six types of bodies, starting with the earth body, are
called 'jiva' due to the intermingling of the eternal jiva and pudgala, based on
practical usage and giving priority to the jiva. However, in terms of definitive
understanding, these senses and bodies are not jivas because they lack the
characteristic of consciousness, which is the defining feature of a jiva. The
knowledge that shines forth in these senses and bodies, in the form of self-
awareness and awareness of others, is what is considered the jiva, due to its
subtle non-duality with the qualities and the qualified.

## The Description of the Path to Liberation through the Nine Substances: Pure
Certainty  **The Jiva is a collection of infinite qualities such as infinite
bliss, etc., which are inherent in pure knowledge, an abstract entity devoid of
senses.** This is the meaning. || 121 ||  **This explains the extraordinary
actions of the Jiva.** The Jiva knows, sees, desires happiness, fears suffering,
performs good and bad actions, and experiences the fruits of both. || 122 ||
**Commentary:** This describes the extraordinary actions of the Jiva, which are
distinct from other beings.  Due to its inherent nature of consciousness, the
Jiva is the doer of actions, knowledge, and perception. The Pudgala, which is
associated with the Jiva, is not the doer, just as space, etc., are not the
doer. The Jiva is the doer of actions that arise from the transformation of
consciousness, such as the desire for happiness, the fear of suffering, and the
performance of actions that are perceived as beneficial or harmful. The Jiva is
also the doer of actions that result from the fruits of good and bad karma, such
as the enjoyment of pleasant and unpleasant objects, and the experience of
happiness and suffering.  Therefore, it is concluded that the Jiva, distinct
from the Pudgala, is inferable through these extraordinary actions. || 122 ||
**Translation of the Sanskrit Text:**  The Jiva knows and sees everything,
desires happiness, fears suffering, performs good and bad actions, and
experiences the fruits of both. The Jiva is the doer of these actions.
**Explanation:**  The text explains that the Jiva is the doer of actions,
knowledge, and perception. This is because the Jiva is a conscious entity, and
its actions are a result of its consciousness. The Pudgala, which is associated
with the Jiva, is not the doer of actions. The Jiva is the doer of actions that
arise from its consciousness, such as the desire for happiness, the fear of
suffering, and the performance of actions that are perceived as beneficial or
harmful. The Jiva is also the doer of actions that result from the fruits of
good and bad karma, such as the enjoyment of pleasant and unpleasant objects,
and the experience of happiness and suffering.  This text is important because
it helps us to understand the nature of the Jiva and its relationship to the
Pudgala. It also helps us to understand the nature of karma and its effects on
the Jiva.

The existence of the soul is to be known by its extraordinary functions, such as
the soul being the doer of the action of desire, which results in happiness, the
action of fear, which results in suffering, the action of the agent, which
results in the consequences of good and bad, and the action of the experiencer,
which results in the experience of the fruits of happiness and suffering.  The
act of being a doer is of three types:  unwholesome, wholesome, and pure use.
Or, the soul is the doer of the substance, karma, and knowledge-obscuration,
etc., according to the non-conventional, non-real, and practical point of view.
The soul is the doer of the mental karma, which is in the form of passions,
etc., according to the impure conviction.  The soul is the doer of the action of
transformation into pure states, such as omniscience, etc., according to the
pure conviction.  Similarly, the soul is the experiencer in all three points of
view.  That is, the soul is the experiencer of the fruits of karma according to
the practical point of view, the experiencer of the feeling of "I am happy" and
"I am unhappy" according to the impure conviction, and the experiencer of the
bliss of the soul according to the pure conviction.  It is said:  "The soul is
the doer of the substance, karma, etc., according to the practical point of
view, the doer of the consciousness, karma, etc., according to the conviction,
and the doer of the pure states according to the pure point of view."  Thus, the
fifth section is completed with two independent verses, the first verse
describing the extraordinary functions of the soul, and the second verse
describing the distinction between the soul and the non-soul.

##  306 **Description of the Path to Liberation through the Nine Substances**
_Explanation of the Jiva and Ajiva, and an Introduction to the Explanation of
Ajiva._  **Verse 123:** Having thus understood the Jiva through many other
synonyms, Know the Ajiva through the signs that are different from knowledge.
**Explanation:** Thus, in this way, through the practical approach, the Jiva is
understood through many synonyms, which are explained in the Karma Grantha, such
as the Jiva's qualities, its state, its path, its attainment of liberation, and
so on. Through the definitive approach, the Jiva is understood through many
synonyms, which are the forms of consciousness and its transformations, due to
the attainment of the universal form, which is the result of the culmination of
attachment, aversion, and delusion. Sometimes these synonyms are impure, and
sometimes they are pure due to the absence of impurity. Having thus understood
the Jiva, which is inherently non-conscious, know the Ajiva, which is connected
or unconnected to the Jiva, through the signs that are different from knowledge,
which are explained here, for the sake of understanding the difference between
the two.  **End of the Explanation of the Jiva.**  **Meaning of the Verse:**
(Thus) in this way, (through many other synonyms) through many other synonyms,
(having understood the Jiva) having understood the Jiva, (through the signs that
are different from knowledge) through the signs that are different from
knowledge, (know the Ajiva) know the Ajiva.  **Commentary:** This verse
concludes the explanation of the Jiva and begins the explanation of the Ajiva.
Having thus understood the Jiva, through many other synonyms, know the Ajiva
through the signs that are different from knowledge. For example, having
understood the Jiva in the way described earlier, through what synonyms? Through
the synonyms mentioned earlier. Not only through the synonyms mentioned earlier,
but also through the practical approach, through the names that are based on the
qualities, the state of the Jiva, its path, its attainment of liberation, and
the differences between them, such as the karma that arises from the body, the
human body, the structure of the body, and so on, and through the definitive
approach, through the impure forms of attachment, aversion, and delusion, and
also through the pure forms of the absence of attachment, aversion, and
delusion, which are the forms of consciousness and its transformations, which
are the essence of the Jiva, which is characterized by the absence of
attachment, aversion, and delusion, and which is characterized by the pure,
unconditioned, blissful, and eternal nature of consciousness.

**The Five Astikayas and Beyond**  With the thirty-seven **rasanubhava** (taste
of experience) **samarasi** (harmonious) **bhavas** (states of being) as the
basis, and other pure **bhavas**, what should one do? What should one know? What
is the **ajiva** (non-living) substance? What are the **lingas** (signs) or
**chinnas** (marks) that distinguish it? The meaning of the sutra is that it
should be known through the **jnana** (knowledge) that is different from the
**jada** (inert) qualities, which will be explained later. ||123||  Thus, the
conclusion of the explanation of the **jiva** (living) substance and the
beginning of the explanation of the **ajiva** substance are both contained in
this single sutra, marking the completion of the sixth **sthala** (stage).
**Summary:**  As mentioned earlier, there is one independent **gatha** (verse)
that names the nine substances, starting with "**jivajiva bhavas**" (living-
living states). Following this, there are fifteen **sutras** (aphorisms) in six
**sthala** (stages) that explain the **jiva** and other substances. In this way,
the second **maha-adhikaran** (major chapter) that explains the nine substances
in sixteen **gatha** (verses) is complete, with the completion of the second
**antara-adhikaran** (sub-chapter).  **Hindi Translation:**  The **utthanika**
(introduction) to the next **gatha** (verse) condenses the explanation of the
**jiva** (living) substance, while the next **gatha** (verse) begins the
explanation of the **ajiva** (non-living) substance.  **General Meaning with
Anvaya (Word Order):**  (Evam) In this way, (annehi vi) by other (bahugehi) many
(pajjayehi) synonyms, (jivam) this living being, (abhigamy) understanding,
(nanantaridehi) by knowledge different from the inert qualities, (lingehi) by
signs, (ajjivam) the non-living principle, (abhigacchadu) know.  **Specific
Meaning:**  Previously, the distinctions of one-sense beings, etc., were
mentioned. By understanding the distinctions of the living beings through these,
then, according to the **vyavahara** (practical) perspective, the distinctions
of worldly beings in terms of **guna-sthana** (quality-place), **jiva-sthana**
(living being-place), and **marga-na** (path-knowledge), and the distinctions of
the living beings' own human, etc., bodies, their structures, and external
forms, which arise from the **udaya** (arising) of **nama-karma** (name-action),
and the distinctions based on the **ashuddha** (impure) **nishcaya** (certainty)
in terms of the impure **bhavas** (states) of **raga** (attachment), **dvesha**
(aversion), and **moha** (delusion), and the distinctions based on the
**shuddha** (pure) **nishcaya** (certainty) in terms of the **vitraga** (free
from attachment) and **vikalpa** (choice)-free **chidananda** (blissful
consciousness) nature of the **atma** (soul) substance, which is experienced as
the **paramananda** (supreme bliss) and the **sukha-amrita** (nectar of
happiness) taste, and the **samarasi** (harmonious) **bhavas** (states) that
arise from this experience, and the pure **parinamana** (transformation)
distinctions, etc., understand the living beings. After that, know the **ajiva**
(non-living) substances through the **jada** (inert) qualities, whose nature
will be explained later. This is the meaning of the sutra. ||123||

## Chapter 308: Description of the Path to Liberation, or Explanation of the
Non-Living Substance  This is an explanation of the reason why space, etc., are
non-living.  **Verse 124:**  * In space, time, matter, merit, and demerit, there
are no qualities of a living being. * Their non-sentience is stated, while the
sentience of a living being is stated.  **Explanation:**  * In space, time,
matter, merit, and demerit, there are no qualities of a living being in the form
of special sentience. This is because space, etc., are generally non-sentient. *
The general non-sentience is only of space, etc., because the general sentience
is only of a living being.  **Now, the explanation of the non-living
substance.**  **Meaning:**  * (In space, time, matter, merit, and demerit) In
space, time, matter, merit, and demerit, (qualities of a living being) there are
no qualities of a living being, (because) [their non-sentience is stated] their
non-sentience is stated, (the sentience of a living being) the sentience of a
living being is stated.  **Commentary:**  * This is a statement of the reason to
show that space, etc., are non-living. * In space, time, matter, merit, and
demerit, there are no qualities of a living being in the form of special
sentience, because space, etc., are generally non-sentient. And the general non-
sentience is only of space, etc., because the general sentience is only of a
living being.  **Commentary:**  * Further, the substance of action, the
substance of material action, the substance of non-action, and the substance of
knowledge, etc., are devoid of the qualities of the state of being, the state of
being a human, the state of being a hell-being, etc., and are of the nature of
infinite qualities like perfect knowledge, etc., and are included within the
nine substances, starting with the living being. They are the ultimate reality,
the true reality, and are the essence of pure time. The substance of pure living
being, which is to be considered, is explained in four verses, starting from the
non-living substance, which is different in nature. In these four verses, the
non-living nature is primarily explained in the three verses, starting with
"space, time," etc., and then, to differentiate, the pure living being in the
body is primarily explained in the verse starting with "tasteless, odorless,"
etc. Thus, in two places, up to the four verses, the explanation of the non-
living substance is a summary. For example, it states the reason for the non-
living nature of space, etc., "In space, time, matter, merit, and demerit, there
are no qualities of a living being like infinite knowledge, etc., therefore,
their non-sentience is stated." Why are there no qualities of a living being in
them? The meaning of the verse "because the sentience is only of a living being"
is that it encompasses all substances, including the three worlds and the three
times.

The text explains the nature of non-living (ajeeva) substances in four verses,
contrasting them with the pure living (jeeva) substance, which is characterized
by the true and certain knowledge of the five astikayas (categories of
existence). The four verses primarily focus on the non-living elements, with
terms like 'Aayasakaal' (time) and 'Paat ka Gaara' (earth) being mentioned. To
further differentiate, a single verse, starting with "Arsamaruvam," describes
the pure living substance within the body. Thus, the text explains the nature of
non-living substances through eight verses, concluding with the complete
explanation of the community (samudaya).  The Hindi translation explains why
space (aakash) and other elements are non-living. The text states that space,
time, matter (pudgal), dharma-astikaya, and adharma-astikaya, the five types of
non-living substances, lack the specific qualities (guna) of living beings. They
are described as being devoid of consciousness (achetan). In contrast, living
beings possess consciousness (chetan).  The verse explains that the ability to
know all things in the three worlds at one time is the inherent nature of
consciousness in living beings. This nature is absent in non-living substances,
making them non-conscious. Only living beings are conscious.  The next verse
further elaborates on the non-consciousness of space and other elements through
an inference. It states that those who lack the ability to experience pleasure
and pain, engage in beneficial actions, and fear harmful actions are considered
non-living by the ascetics (shramanas).  The commentary clarifies that this
verse establishes the general non-consciousness of space and other elements
through inference. Since space and other elements lack the specific qualities of
consciousness, such as the ability to experience pleasure and pain, engage in
beneficial actions, and fear harmful actions, they are considered non-living.

##  310 **Description of the Nine Substances and the Path to Liberation (Moksha)
by the Saints**  Having established the non-sentience of space and the other
substances, the Sutra now explains the reason for this.   **The Sutra states:**
"That which does not possess the knowledge of pleasure and pain, nor the
inclination towards its own good, nor fear of its own harm, is always called
*ajeeva* (non-living) by the Shramanas (ascetics). This is what is being
explained.  For the ignorant, things like flowers, garlands, women, sandalwood,
etc., are considered beneficial, and they perform acts of charity and worship
for them. Similarly, they consider snakes, poison, thorns, etc., as harmful.
However, for the enlightened, the ultimate reality, the *paramatma* (supreme
soul), which is the essence of the three jewels of right faith, right knowledge,
and right conduct, is considered beneficial. And the *atma* (soul) which is
transformed by false beliefs, attachment, etc., and which causes suffering and
anxiety, is considered harmful.  Thus, the absence of these specific qualities
of consciousness, which are the examination of what is beneficial and harmful,
is the reason why space and the other five substances are non-sentient."
**Commentary:**  This Sutra explains the difference between the *jeeva* (living
being) and the *pudgala* (matter) by stating that the *jeeva* possesses
consciousness, while the *pudgala* does not. The *jeeva* experiences pleasure
and pain, and has the capacity to act for its own good or avoid harm. The
*pudgala*, on the other hand, is inert and lacks these qualities.  **Further
Explanation:**  The Sutra then goes on to describe the characteristics of the
*pudgala* in more detail. It states that the *pudgala* is composed of various
qualities, such as color, taste, touch, smell, and sound. These qualities are
derived from the *pudgala* substance and are subject to change.  The Sutra also
states that the *pudgala* is not sentient and does not have the capacity to
perceive or experience. It is simply a collection of qualities that are subject
to the laws of nature.  **Conclusion:**  The Sutra concludes by emphasizing the
difference between the *jeeva* and the *pudgala*. The *jeeva* is a conscious
being with the capacity for liberation, while the *pudgala* is inert matter that
is subject to the laws of nature.

Know that the **Jiva** is **Alingagrahanam**, **Anirdishtasanstanam**,
**Arasam**, **Arupam**, **Agandham**, **Avyaktam**, **Asabdam**, and
**Chetanagunam**. ||127||  That which is capable of being perceived by the
senses due to its possession of qualities like touch, taste, smell, color, and
sound, and due to its transformation into various forms like **sanstanas**,
**sanghatas**, etc., is **Pudgaladravyam**. But that which is not capable of
being perceived by the senses due to its lack of qualities like touch, taste,
smell, color, and sound, and due to its transformation into various forms like
**Avyaktam**, **Anirdishtasanstanam**, etc., is **Jivadravyam**, distinct from
both **Rupi** and **Arupi** **Ajiva** due to its possession of **Chetanagunam**.
Thus, the real difference between **Jiva** and **Ajiva** is explained here for
the sake of making the path of **Samyagjnani** clear. ||126-127||  Thus ends the
explanation of the **Ajiva** substance.  _San. Ta.- Although **Sanstanas** etc.,
which are **Pudgala** transformations, exist along with **Jiva** like milk and
water, they are certainly not the essence of **Jiva**. This is the knowledge of
the difference. - **Samchaturasra** etc., six **Sanstanas** are related to the
body like **Audarika** etc., five **Sanghatas** are **varna**, **rasa**,
**sparsa**, **gandha**, and **sabda**. These are all born from
**Pudgaladravyam** because they are certainly different from the **Paramatma**
substance which is devoid of **Sanstanas** etc., **Pudgala** transformations,
and is endowed with the four infinite qualities like **Kevalajnanam** etc. In
the question of which are qualities and which are transformations among these,
the answer is - **varna**, **rasa**, **sparsa**, and **gandha** are qualities,
while **Sanstanas** etc., are transformations.

## Translation:  **Verse 126:**  The meaning of the sutra is that there are many
descriptions of the nine substances and the path to liberation.  **Commentary:**
The first section of the text has already discussed the non-living nature of the
five substances, including pudgala, using three verses.  Now, in response to the
question, "If formations (sanstthana) and other things are not the nature of the
soul, then what is the nature of the soul?", the text explains:  * The soul is
not the substance of pudgala, which has the qualities of taste (rasa) and other
qualities. * It is not merely the qualities of taste. * It is not the sense
organ of the tongue, which is made of pudgala and is called "jihvendraiya". * It
is not the object of perception, which has the quality of taste, and is
perceived by the tongue sense organ. * It is not the perceiver, the sense organ
itself, which perceives taste. * It is not the mind (bhaavendraiya), which
perceives the taste and removes the karmas. * It is not the knowledge
(kevalgyaan) that is a single, undivided awareness of all objects of perception,
which is born from the mind (bhaavendraiya) and is the cause of the knowledge of
taste. * It is not the knowledge of taste, which is a part of the knowledge of
all objects of perception. * It is not the soul that knows the taste and becomes
one with it.  Therefore, the soul is tasteless (arasa).  This explanation should
be applied to the other senses, such as sight, smell, sound, and touch, in a
similar way.  **Verse 127:**  **Commentary:**  * **Avyakta:** Just as the cycle
of karmas, such as anger, etc., is not present in the pure soul, which is free
from the perception of the false, attachment, etc., and is not manifested in the
impure soul, similarly, the Supreme Soul is not manifested in the impure soul. *
**Asanstthana:** The Supreme Soul is not formed by the six formations
(samchaturstra, etc.) that arise from the karmas of pudgala, because it is a
single, undivided awareness, free from all formations, including the four-sided
formation (vritta-chaturstra), etc. * **Alingagrahan:** Although the pure soul
is known indirectly through inference, characteristics, indirect knowledge, and
conventional understanding, like knowing fire from smoke, it is not directly
perceived by others, as it is perceived by the perfect yogis, who are free from
the defilements of attachment, etc., and whose pure soul is directly perceived
by them. Their pure soul is filled with the nectar of true happiness, like a pot
filled with water, and is free from all anxieties.  **Meaning:**  The soul is
pure consciousness (shuddha chetana guna) and has the quality of knowledge
(kevalgyaan), as described in the verse: "He who knows all moving and non-moving
things, all their qualities, and all their transformations, past, present, and
future, at every moment, is called the omniscient. Salutations to the
omniscient, the Lord of the Jinas, the great hero."  **Conclusion:**  This
section of the text explains the nature of the pure soul, which is free from all
defilements and is the ultimate goal of liberation. It also emphasizes the
importance of understanding the difference between the pure soul and the impure
soul.  This section concludes the second major chapter, which deals with the
nine substances, and the third sub-chapter within it.

The five Astikayas, beginning with the Panchaastikaya, are the five fundamental
substances in Jain cosmology. These five substances are:  1. **Pudgala**
(matter) 2. **Jiva** (soul) 3. **Akasha** (space) 4. **Kala** (time) 5.
**Dharma** (principle of motion)  The text states that the five Astikayas are
**ajiva** (non-living) and that they are distinct from the **Atman** (soul). The
Atman is described as being devoid of the qualities of **Pudgala**, such as
**varna** (color), **rasa** (taste), **sparsa** (touch), and **gandha** (smell).
It is also described as being **kevalajnana** (omniscient) and possessing
**anant chatushtaya** (infinite qualities).  The text then goes on to describe
the nature of the **Jiva** (soul). It states that the Jiva is **arasa** (devoid
of taste), **arupa** (devoid of color), **agandha** (devoid of smell),
**ayatta** (unmanifest), **asai** (devoid of sound), **chedanaguna** (possessing
the quality of consciousness), **alingaggrahan** (not capable of being perceived
by the senses), and **anittihsanthan** (not possessing a specific form).  The
text further clarifies that the Jiva is not **Pudgala** or any of its qualities,
nor is it a **dravyaindriya** (sense organ) like the **jihwa** (tongue). It also
states that the Jiva is not capable of being perceived by the senses, nor does
it perceive the world through the senses. The Jiva's knowledge is
**kevalajnana** (omniscient) and is not dependent on the senses.  The text
concludes by stating that the Jiva is not **bhavaindriya** (the sense organ of
feeling) and that it does not perceive the world through the sense of feeling.
The Jiva's knowledge is **kevalajnana** (omniscient) and is not dependent on the
sense of feeling.

314 The living being is subtle because it is described as the path to liberation
by the nine substances. In the same way, this living being is devoid of color,
smell, sound, and touch. In these too, like rasa, it is appropriate to
understand the all-encompassing explanation. And just as the fourfold of anger,
pride, deceit, and greed, which lead to false belief and attachment, etc., do
not appear to living beings devoid of the attainment of the pure self-nature, so
too, this supreme self-nature does not appear to them. Therefore, it is
unmanifest. This living being is certainly the undivided, luminous, supreme
self-nature, devoid of the six bodies, such as the equal-four-sided, etc., in
their formation or shape. Therefore, it does not have the six bodies, such as
the equal-four-sided, etc., obtained from the pulsating karma. Therefore, this
living being is devoid of bodies. And just as the impure soul is recognized by
the practical method through indirect knowledge, which is in the form of
inference, in the same way that fire is inferred from smoke, so too, this pure
soul, although devoid of attachments, etc., is directly perceived by perfect
yogis, who are fully established in the supreme bliss, which is free from all
anxieties, arising from self-awareness, and is like a full pitcher of the nectar
of true happiness. However, it is not directly experienced by those who are not
such yogis. Therefore, this living being is "unperceived by the senses." And
this living being is endowed with the pure consciousness quality, which is the
knowledge of the self, and therefore is in the form of consciousness, as stated
in the verse: "He who knows all movable and immovable, diverse substances, their
qualities, their past, future, and present states, in all ways, always,
simultaneously, every moment, is called the omniscient. To that omniscient, the
Jinesvara, and the great hero, the Lord, be salutations." O disciple! Know that
this pure living being substance, which is endowed with the pure consciousness
quality called "knowledge of the self," is distinct from these qualities, as
stated in the verse. || 127 ||  In this way, the second section, which explains
the nine substances in two sections, in four verses, was completed with the
second section, which speaks of the pure living being, which is capable of being
perceived in all ways, for the sake of understanding the difference.  The above-
mentioned fundamental substances. Now, for the sake of introducing the other
seven substances, which are produced by the combination and transformation, the
cycle of living being, matter, and karma is described.  The living being, who is
the object of the world, is the cause of transformation. From transformation
comes karma, and from karma comes the state of existence. || 128 ||

From the attainment of the **gati** (state of existence), the body and the sense
organs arise. From these, the grasping of objects occurs, and from that, either
attachment (raga) or aversion (dvesha) arises. Thus, the state of the living
being is born, revolving in the wheel of samsara (cycle of birth and death).
This is what the **Jina** (Tirthankara) has said, that it is without beginning
(anadinidhana) or with an end (sanidhana).   This is because, due to the
influence of the **upaadhi** (limiting conditions) of the bond of the living
being in samsara, there is a continuous flow of **parinaama** (transformation).
From this **parinaama**, **karma** (action) arises, which is of the nature of
**pudhgala** (matter) transformation. From **karma**, there is movement in the
**gati** (states of existence) like hell, etc. From the attainment of the
**gati**, the body arises. From the body, the sense organs arise. From the sense
organs, the grasping of objects occurs. From the grasping of objects, attachment
and aversion arise. From attachment and aversion, again, there is a continuous
flow of **parinaama**. From this **parinaama**, again, **karma** arises, which
is of the nature of **pudhgala** transformation. From **karma**, again, there is
movement in the **gati** (states of existence) like hell, etc. From the
attainment of the **gati**, again, the body arises. From the body, again, the
sense organs arise. From the sense organs, again, the grasping of objects
occurs. From the grasping of objects, again, attachment and aversion arise. From
attachment and aversion, again, there is a continuous flow of **parinaama**.
Thus, this network of **karma**, which is of the nature of the transformation of
the living being and **pudhgala**, being mutually cause and effect, revolves
like a wheel in the cycle of samsara, without beginning (anadinidhana) or with
an end (sanidhana). In this, the **parinaama** of the living being is caused by
the **pudhgala** transformation, and the **pudhgala** transformation is caused
by the **parinaama** of the living being, which should be understood as the seed
of the objects to be explained later.

##  Navapadartha - Mokshamarg Varnan  **Commentary:** In this world, due to the
influence of the endless bondage-like upadhikās, the worldly being experiences a
continuous cycle of snigdha parināma. From parināma arises karma, which is made
up of pudgala parināma. Karma leads to the attainment of gati, which in turn
leads to the acquisition of a body. From the body arise the indriyas, which then
lead to the perception of objects. This perception of objects gives rise to raga
and dvesha, which again lead to snigdha parināma. This cycle continues
endlessly, with parināma leading to karma, karma leading to gati, and so on. In
this way, the interconnected cause-and-effect relationship between the jiva
parināma and the pudgala parināma-based karma binds the jiva in the cycle of
samsara, causing it to endlessly revolve like a wheel.  Therefore, it is said
that the jiva parināma, which is the cause of pudgala parināma, and the pudgala
parināma, which is the cause of jiva parināma, are the seeds of the seven
substances (punya, papa, etc.) that will be discussed later. || 128-130 ||
**Commentary:** If the dravya is completely parināmit, then there is only one
substance, which is the parināma of the combination of jiva and pudgala. Or, if
the dravya is completely aparināmit, then there are only two substances, the
pure jiva and the pure pudgala. There is no occurrence of punya, papa, etc., so
what is the fault? The absence of bondage and liberation is the fault, and to
eliminate this fault, parināma and aparināma are completely negated. If this
negation is accepted, then how can there be parināma? And if there is no
parināma, then how can the seven substances occur? The student asks: Even if
there is some parināma, and the seven substances of punya, etc., occur, their
purpose is fulfilled only by the jiva and ajīva, because they are just different
forms of the jiva and ajīva.  **Response:** The purpose of mentioning these
seven substances is to show the nature of the desirable and undesirable for the
bhavyas. This is what is being said: Suffering is undesirable, and its cause is
samsara. The cause of samsara is the bondage-related substances, and their cause
is the triad of mithyadarshana, mithyajnana, and mithyacharita. Therefore,
happiness is desirable, and its cause is liberation. The cause of liberation is
the pair of samvara and nirjara. And their cause is the triad of samyagdarshana,
samyagjnana, and samyacharita. Thus, the two substances of jiva and ajīva, which
were mentioned earlier, and the seven substances of punya, etc., which will be
discussed later, together constitute the nine substances. This concludes the
section on the establishment of the nine substances.  **Further:** From now on,
the combination-parināma of jiva and pudgala, which was established earlier
based on the power of some parināma, should be understood as the cause and seed
of the seven substances of punya, etc., which will be discussed later. In the
fourth chapter of the Pātanikā, it is said: "The jiva who is in samsara
experiences parināma. From parināma arises new karma. From karma arises gati in
the gatis. This is the first verse. The one who has attained gati acquires a
body. From the body arise the indriyas. From the indriyas arises the perception
of objects. From this arises raga and dvesha. This is the second verse. Thus,
the jiva experiences delusion and wandering. Where? In the cycle of samsara.
What is its special characteristic? It is described by the Jina Virs. What is
its further special characteristic? It is endless and without beginning or end,
in comparison to the abhavyas and bhavyas. This is the third verse. For example,
although this jiva is inherently pure and has the nature of pure knowledge and
vision, due to the bondage of endless karma, it experiences impure parināma,
which is characterized by atmasamvitti. From this parināma arises karma, which
covers the inherent nature of the jiva, which is characterized by infinite
knowledge, etc., and binds the jiva with pudgalika karma, such as jnanaavarana,
etc."

The five astikayas, beginning with the first, are the five types of happiness,
which are different from the happiness of the five senses. These five astikayas
are the cause of the four types of births, namely, the births of gods, humans,
animals, and hell beings. After these births, the body, which is opposite to the
soul, which is pure consciousness and bliss, is born. Then, from the soul, which
is the form of the supreme self, the senses, which are opposite to the soul, are
born. From these senses, the happiness of the five senses, which is opposite to
the pure bliss of the soul, which is born from the meditation of the pure soul
without any object, is born. Then, from the soul, which is the abode of infinite
knowledge and other virtues, which is free from the defects of attachment,
aversion, and delusion, attachment and aversion are born. From the attachment
and aversion, which are the cause of the karma, which is the effect, the karma
is born. This is the cause and effect relationship between the attachment,
aversion, and karma. This is the cause of the auspicious and inauspicious
things, which will be discussed later. Therefore, to destroy the cycle of birth
and death, one should meditate on the soul, which is the form of the group of
infinite auspicious virtues, and abandon the thoughts of the world, like the
sky.  Furthermore, a knowledgeable soul, who has attained the knowledge of
truth, becomes the doer of the inauspicious things, the bondage, and the flow,
even though he is free from the modifications of the soul. Sometimes, due to the
rise of delusion, he becomes the doer of the auspicious things, which are the
result of the inauspicious things, because of the desire for the objects of
enjoyment, which are seen, heard, and experienced. However, a knowledgeable
soul, who has attained the knowledge of truth, becomes the doer of the
restraint, the flow, and the liberation, because of the three jewels of non-
duality, which are the taste, the perception, and the unshakeable experience,
which are in the soul. When he is unable to remain in the three jewels of non-
duality, he becomes the doer of the auspicious things, which are the cause of
the destruction of the cycle of birth and death, because of the unwavering
devotion to the supreme self, which is free from defects, and the teachers, the
preceptors, and the saints, who are the followers of the supreme self. This is
the cause of the destruction of the cycle of birth and death and the cause of
liberation. This is the auspicious thing, which is the result of the auspicious
things, which are the result of the Tirthankaras and other auspicious things,
which is free from the cause of the result. In this way, an ignorant soul
becomes the doer of the four inauspicious things, while a knowledgeable soul
becomes the doer of the three auspicious things. This is the meaning.  Thus, the
second great chapter, which explains the nine things, ends with the fourth
chapter, which states that the seven things, namely, the auspicious, the
inauspicious, and the five astikayas, are the result of the combination and
separation of the soul and the matter.  **Preface:** If someone doubts that the
soul becomes one with the matter in all ways, then the soul and the matter are
one thing, which is the result of the combination. Or, if someone doubts that
both the soul and the matter are pure and free from all modifications, then the
auspicious and inauspicious things are not real. Then, there will be no bondage
or liberation. To remove this doubt, one should know that both the soul and the
matter are neither modifiable nor unmodifiable. Therefore, both are modifiable
in relation to something. Only then, the seven things, namely, the support, the
object, the knowledge, the faith, the conduct, the power, and the liberation,
can be established. Then, the disciple said, "Even though the seven things are
established because of the modifiability of the soul and the matter in relation
to something, they are useless. The soul and the non-soul are enough, because
the seven things are just synonyms of the soul and the matter." The teacher
replied, "To show the nature of the things that should be abandoned and the
things that should be accepted by the aspiring souls, the seven things are
explained."

##  318 ##  Description of the Path to Liberation (Moksha) through the Nine
Substances (Navapadaartha)  The statement of the substances is presented here.
The principle that is worthy of being abandoned is suffering (duhkha). The cause
of suffering is the world (samsara). The causes of the world are the binding
substances (astrava) and the binding (bandha). The causes of these binding
substances and binding are false perception (mithyadarshan), false knowledge
(mithyagyan), and false conduct (mithyacharitra). The principle that is worthy
of being embraced is happiness (sukha). Its cause is liberation (moksha). The
causes of liberation are restraint (samvara) and shedding (nirjara). The causes
of these two are right perception (samyagdarshan), right knowledge (samyagyan),
and right conduct (samyakcharitra). In this way, taking the two substances of
the living being (jiva) and the non-living (ajiva) mentioned earlier, along with
the seven substances of merit (punya), demerit (papa), etc., that are worthy of
being discussed further, they all come together to form the nine substances of
the community (samudaya). In this way, the establishment of the nine substances
(navapadaartha) chapter is complete.  ##  Hindi Translation (Uttanika)  What
follows is the explanation of how the living being (jiva) and the non-living
(puhl) are considered to have the power of transformation (parinaman shakti) and
how their combination (sanyog) is established. This combination is the cause or
seed (beeja) of the seven substances of merit (punya), demerit (papa), etc.,
that are worthy of being discussed further. This is explained in three verses.
##  General Meaning with Anvaya (Grammatical Analysis)  (Khlu) Truly, (jo)
whoever (sansarattha) wanders in the world (jiva) is an impure soul (tatto) from
that (du) itself (parinamo) impure state (hodi) arises. (Parinamaado) From the
impure state (kammam) the binding of karma occurs. (Kammaado) From the arising
of those karmas (gadisu gadi) some state (hodi) arises from the four states of
existence (gadin) the state (adhigadassa) attained by the living being (deho)
has a gross body (dehaado) from the body (indiyaani) the senses (jayante) are
born. (Tehi du) From those senses themselves (vishayaggrahanam) the reception of
objects of sense like touch, etc., occurs. (Tatto) From the reception of that
object (rago cha doso va) attachment (raga) or aversion (dosha) arises. (Evam)
In this way (sansarachakkavalammi) in the rotation of this wheel of the world
(jivassa) the state (bhavo) of the living being (jayade) continues to arise.
(Idi) Thus (jinavarehi) the Jina (Jineendradev) has (bhanido) said. This state
(anadinighano) is without beginning (anadi) and infinite (anant) in duration
with respect to the non-virtuous (abhavya). (Sanighano va) And with respect to
the virtuous (bhavya) it is without beginning (anadi) but also has an end.  ##
Specific Meaning  Although this living being (jiva) is inherently pure
(nishchayanya) and possesses the nature of pure knowledge (vishuddha jnana) and
perception (darshan), yet in practical terms (vyavharanaya), due to being bound
by karma since time immemorial (anadikal), this living being experiences
(anubhavagochar) an impure state (ashuddha bhavo). From this impure state
(ashuddha bhavo), it binds (bandhata) the karmas of knowledge-obscuring
(jnanaavaran), etc., which are made of matter (pudgal) and which cover the
nature of the soul (atma) that is free from karma (karmase rahita) and possesses
infinite knowledge (anantagyana), etc. From the arising (udaya) of these karmas,
the soul (atma) is separated from the happiness (sukha) of the fifth state of
existence (panchamagati) - liberation (moksha) - and is born into the states of
gods (dev), humans (manushya), etc.

The soul, which is naturally pure consciousness and bliss, transmigrates through
the four states of existence: the five senses, the 319 hells, the animal realm,
and the human realm. In these states, it acquires a gross body, which is
contrary to its true nature. This body gives rise to senses that are opposed to
the pure, transcendental, and subtle nature of the soul. These senses lead to
the enjoyment of worldly pleasures, which are contrary to the pure bliss that
arises from the contemplation of the soul, free from the objects of the five
senses. This leads to the development of attachment and aversion, which are
contrary to the infinite knowledge and other virtues that are inherent in the
soul. Attachment and aversion lead to the binding of karma, which is similar to
the karma bound in the past. This cycle of attachment, aversion, and karma is
the cause of the seven substances: merit, demerit, etc., which will be discussed
later. To break this cycle of samsara, one should cultivate the infinite bliss
and other virtues that are inherent in the soul, by abandoning attachment and
aversion.  The ignorant soul, being subject to change, does not realize its true
nature, which is free from all defilements. It becomes the doer of demerit,
inflow, and bondage. Sometimes, due to the influence of subtle false belief, it
also becomes the doer of merit, which is the cause of future demerit, due to the
binding of desire for the objects of the senses. However, the wise soul, through
the three jewels of faith, knowledge, and conduct, becomes the doer of
restraint, purification, and liberation. When unable to abide in the three
jewels of non-duality, certainty, and the three jewels, it engages in complete
and special devotion to the perfect and supreme soul, the liberated ones, and
their followers: the teachers, the preceptors, and the monks. This leads to the
binding of special merits, such as the nature of the Tirthankaras, which are the
cause of liberation and the destruction of samsara. This binding of merit is the
cause of future merit, making the wise soul the doer of merit. Thus, the
ignorant soul is the doer of demerit, merit, inflow, and bondage, while the wise
soul is the doer of restraint, purification, and liberation.  This concludes the
fourth chapter, which mainly discusses the seven substances: merit, demerit,
etc., which arise from the combination and separation of the soul and matter.
This chapter is divided into three sections, which explain these seven
substances.  Now, we will discuss the substance of merit and demerit.

## 320 **Description of the Nine Substances and the Path to Liberation**
**_Punyakarma and Papkarma are the causes of attachment, and from this
attachment arise delusion, anger, hatred, and mental clarity.  The result for
one who has these is either auspicious or inauspicious._**  **_Delusion, anger,
hatred, or mental clarity, whichever exists in one's being, results in either
auspicious or inauspicious consequences._**  Here, delusion is the result of the
karmic consequences of the delusion of perception.  Anger and hatred are the
pleasure and displeasure that arise from the karmic consequences of the delusion
of conduct.  Mental clarity is the pure result of the subtle arising of the
delusion of conduct.  Thus, whoever has these (delusion, anger, hatred, or
mental clarity) will inevitably have auspicious or inauspicious consequences.
Where there is praiseworthy anger and mental clarity, there is an auspicious
consequence.  Where there is delusion, hatred, and unpraiseworthy anger, there
is an inauspicious consequence.  **_Now, an explanation of the substances of
Punyakarma and Papkarma._**  **Meaning of the Verse:**  (In whose being) in the
being of one who (has delusion) delusion, (anger) anger, (hatred) hatred, (or)
or (mental clarity) mental clarity (exists) exists, (for him) for him
(auspicious or inauspicious) auspicious or inauspicious (consequences)
consequences (happen) happen.  **Commentary:** This is a statement of the nature
(essence) of the appropriate states of being for Punyakarma and Papkarma.  Here,
delusion is the polluted consequence of the karmic consequences of the delusion
of perception.  Anger and hatred are the pleasure and displeasure that arise
from the karmic consequences of the delusion of conduct.  Mental clarity is the
pure result of the subtle arising of the delusion of conduct.  Thus, whoever has
these (delusion, anger, hatred, or mental clarity) will inevitably have
auspicious or inauspicious consequences.  Where there is praiseworthy anger and
mental clarity, there is an auspicious consequence.  Where there is delusion,
hatred, and unpraiseworthy anger, there is an inauspicious consequence.
**Summary:**  This is a four-verse chapter on the topic of Punyakarma and
Papkarma.  The first verse, "Moho va ragadoasa" etc., is primarily about the
indication of the pure nature of the Supreme Bliss.  The second verse,
"Suhaparinaamo" etc., is primarily about the explanation of the two substances
of Punyakarma and Papkarma, which are the objects of destruction, from the pure
nature of the pure intellect.  The third verse, "Jahma kammassa phala" etc., is
primarily about the affirmation of the corporeality of the two substances of
Punyakarma and Papkarma, in order to refute the Naiyayika view.  The fourth
verse, "Muttho pasadi" etc., is primarily about establishing the contact and
binding of the two karmas, the ancient and the recent, in order to establish the
purity of the non-corporeal soul, and to show that the soul, in relation to the
ancient chain of binding, is considered corporeal in the conventional sense, and
to show the binding of corporeal karma with the corporeal soul.  Thus, these
four verses are the essence of the fifth chapter.  For example,

##  The Nature of Puny (Merit) and Papa (Demerit)  **Pancastikaya Prabhrit**
321. Now, the nature of Puny (merit) and Papa (demerit) is explained:  For a
Jiva (soul) who has Moha (delusion), Raga (attachment), Dvesha (aversion), or
Chittaprasada (mental tranquility) in its Bhava (state of being) or Manas
(mind), its Parinam (consequence) will be either Shubha (auspicious) or Ashubha
(inauspicious).  **Details:**  * When Darshanmoha (delusion in perception)
arises, the Jiva lacks the taste for the true nature of the self (Nischya
Shuddhatma) and the three jewels of conduct (Vyavahar Ratna Tray). The resulting
consequence is Darshanmoha. * When the Jiva experiences Vichitracharitramoha
(delusion in conduct), it lacks the true understanding of the nature of the self
(Nischya Vitaraga Charitra) and the conduct of vows (Vyavahar Vratadi). The
resulting consequences are Raga (attachment) and Dvesha (aversion) towards the
desirable and undesirable. * When the Jiva experiences a mild form of Moha
(delusion), it experiences Chittaprasada (mental tranquility).  **Summary:**  *
Moha (delusion) and Dvesha (aversion) are Ashubha (inauspicious). * Raga
(attachment) towards undesirable objects is Ashubha (inauspicious). * Raga
(attachment) towards desirable objects like charity, worship, and vows is Shubha
(auspicious). * Chittaprasada (mental tranquility) is Shubha (auspicious).  This
is the meaning of the Sutra. || 131 ||  **Explanation:**  This section discusses
the nature of Puny (merit) and Papa (demerit) in a single Sutra.  **Further
Explanation:**  The following four verses discuss Puny (merit) and Papa
(demerit) in detail.  * The first verse states that the Bhavas (states of being)
that are conducive to Puny (merit) or Papa (demerit) are different from the pure
soul (Shuddhatma) which is characterized by infinite bliss. * The second verse
explains that Puny (merit) and Papa (demerit) are not the true nature of the
soul (Shuddhatma) but are rather temporary states of being that need to be
overcome. * The third verse refutes the Nyaya school of thought which considers
both Puny (merit) and Papa (demerit) as material entities. * The fourth verse
explains that the Jiva (soul) and Karma (action) are inseparable and have been
bound together since time immemorial. Although the Jiva (soul) is inherently
immaterial, it is considered material in a practical sense due to its long-
standing association with Karma (action). This association leads to the binding
of the Jiva (soul) with Karma (action).  These four verses complete the
discussion on Puny (merit) and Papa (demerit) in the fifth chapter of the
Pancastikaya.  **Hindi Translation:**  **Uttanika:** Now, the nature of Bhavas
(states of being) that are conducive to Puny (merit) and Papa (demerit) is
explained.  **Anvaya Sahit Samanyarth:** (Ass) The Jiva (soul) (Bhavammi) whose
Bhava (state of being) has (Moho) delusion, (Rago) attachment, (Dosho) aversion,
and (Chittaprasado) mental tranquility (Viddidi) is present, (Tass) that Jiva
(Suho) will experience auspicious (Va) or (Asuho) inauspicious (Va) (Parinamo)
consequences.  **Vishesharth:** When Darshanmoha (delusion in perception) arises
due to Karma (action), the Jiva lacks the taste for the true nature of the self
(Nischya Shuddhatma) and the three jewels of conduct (Vyavahar Ratna Tray). Such
a Jiva is considered to be an external soul (Bahiratma).

## 322 ## Navpadartha - Mokshamarg Varnan  The opposite result that occurs
within is called Darshanmoha or Moha.  As the various types of Charitra Moha
arise in the same soul, there is neither a definite Vitaraga Charitra nor the
results of Vyavahar Vratas etc.  Within such a being, there is Raga, which is
the feeling of liking for desirable objects, and Dvesha, which is the feeling of
disliking for undesirable objects.  The subtle manifestation of that same Moha,
which is the purification of the mind, is called Chittaprasad.  Here, the
meaning of the Sutra is that Moha and Dvesha, and the Ashubha Raga for objects
etc., are Ashubha Bhavas, and the Shubha Raga or the delight of the mind, in the
form of Dana, Puja, Vratas, Sheela etc., are Shubha Bhavas. || 131 ||  Thus, the
first section is complete with one Sutra, describing the Shubha and Ashubha
results.  **Punyapapaswaroopaakhyanametat.**  **Suha-parinaamo punnam asuho
paavam ti havadhi jivassa.**  **Doham poggal metto bhaavo kammattanam patto.**
|| 132 ||  **Shubhaparinaamah punyamashubhah paapamiti bhavathi jeeva. Dwayoh
pudgalamatrah bhavah karmtavampraptah.** || 132 ||  The Shubhaparinaama, which
has become the definite Karma of the Jeeva, is the cause of Dravyapunya, only as
a cause, and therefore, after the Asrava of Dravyapunya, it becomes Bhava punya.
Similarly, the Ashubhaparinaama, which has become the definite Karma of the
Jeeva, is the cause of Dravypaapa, only as a cause, and therefore, after the
Asrava of Dravypaapa, it becomes Bhavapaapa.  The Vishishtprakruttirupa
parinaama, which has become the definite Karma of the Pudgala, is the cause of
Dravyapunya, due to the Shubhaparinaama of the Jeeva.  The Vishishtprakruttirupa
parinaama, which has become the definite Karma of the Pudgala, is the cause of
Dravypaapa, due to the Ashubhaparinaama of the Jeeva.  Thus, through Vyavahar
and Nishchay, the Karma of the soul, both Murta and Amurta, is known. || 132 ||
**Anvayarth (Jeevasya) Jeevake (Shubhaparinaamah) Shubhaparinaama (punyam) punya
hain aur (ashubhah) Ashubhaparinaama (paapamiti bhavathi) paapa hain (dwayoh) un
dono ke dwara (pudgalamatrah bhavah) pudgalamatrah bhavah (karmtavampraptah)
karm pane ko prapt hote hain.**  **Teeka - This is the statement of the nature
of punya and paapa.**  The Shubhaparinaama, which is the definite Karma of the
Jeeva, is the cause of Dravyapunya, only as a cause.  Therefore, before the
Asrava of Dravyapunya, they are Shubhaparinaama, which become Bhava punya.
Similarly, the Ashubhaparinaama, which is the definite Karma of the Jeeva, is
the cause of Dravypaapa, only as a cause.  Therefore, before the Asrava of
Dravypaapa, they are Ashubhaparinaama, which become Bhavapaapa.  The
Vishishtprakruttirupa parinaama, which is the definite Karma of the Pudgala, is
the cause of Dravyapunya, due to the Shubhaparinaama of the Jeeva.  The
Vishishtprakruttirupa parinaama, which is the definite Karma of the Pudgala, is
the cause of Dravypaapa, due to the Ashubhaparinaama of the Jeeva.  Thus,
through Vyavahar and Nishchay, the Karma of the soul, both Murta and Amurta, is
known. || 132 ||

324 Navapadartha - Mokshamarg Varnan  In this way, the explanation of the
dravya, which is worthy of being renounced, and the punya and papa, which are in
the form of bhava, different from the pure soul, which has pure buddhi svabhava,
ended from one sutra to another place. This is the support of the moort karma.
Because the fruit of karma is enjoyed by the jiva through the senses, karma is
moort. Anvayaartha - (Yasmat) because (karma nah phal) the fruit of karma
(vishay) which (moort) is the object (niyatam) by rule (sparshai) (moort aisi)
by the senses of touch etc. (jivena) by the jiva (sukha dukha) in the form of
happiness or in the form of sorrow (bhujyate) is enjoyed, (tasmat) therefore
(karmaani) karma (moortani) is moort. Tika - This is the support of moort karma.
The object, which is the fruit of karma and the cause of happiness and sorrow,
is moort by rule and is enjoyed by the jiva through the moort senses, therefore
the moortness of karma is inferred. Just as - moort karma, because it is moort,
is experienced through its connection with the moort fruit, like poison. San.
Ta. - Now, the moortness of karma is established, Jahma - Yasmat karanat kammas
phal - the fruit of karma which has arisen. What kind of fruit is it? Visayam -
moort panchendriya vishay roop, bhujjade - bhujyate, niyadam - nischit. By whom,
the doer? Jivena - by the jiva, who has transcended the objects and has arisen
the bliss of the supreme soul, the taste of nectar, and is not subject to
change. By what causes? Phaasehi - by the senses of touch etc., which are moort,
opposite to the pure soul, which is without the senses of touch etc. Again, what
kind of fruit of karma is it, which is the object of the five senses? Suha dukha
- happiness and sorrow, although they are amoort in pure knowledge, but because
they are opposite to the supreme bliss, which is the characteristic of the
knowledge of the true nature, they are moort happiness and sorrow in the form of
joy and sorrow. Tahya moortani karmaani - because, as mentioned earlier, it is
enjoyed by the moort senses, which are in the form of the five senses of touch
etc., and because the karma itself is moort, in the form of happiness and
sorrow, it is seen, therefore, it is known by the inference of the effect, that
karma is moort, because the effect is similar to the cause. Thus, the third
place has been reached in one sutra, in the form of the support of the moortness
of punya and papa, by the division of the nayas, for the purpose of informing
the disciples who follow the Nyaya school of thought.

The five astikayas, starting with the Hindi Ta-utthanika, prove that these
dravyakarmas are murtik.  **General Meaning with Anvaya:** (Because) [jivena] by
this jiva, [kammassa phalam] the fruit of karma, [suh dukkham], happiness and
sorrow, [visayam] which is the object of the five senses, [niyadam] definitely
[phasehin] by means of the senses of touch etc., [bhunjade] is enjoyed, [tamha]
therefore, [kammani] dravyakarmas [muttani] are murtik.  **Specific Meaning:**
The jiva who has fallen from the taste of the blissful nectar born from the
contemplation of the Supreme Being devoid of objects, experiences the fruit of
the karmas obtained upon coming into existence. That karmic fruit is murtik,
being the object of the five senses and is full of happiness and sorrow in the
form of joy and sorrow. Although it is amurtik in pure certainty, it is murtik
in the form of happiness and sorrow of the objects, due to being opposite to the
certain happiness which is amurtik in the ultimate sense and is characterized by
supreme bliss, because it is enjoyed by the murtik senses of touch etc., which
are opposite to the amurtik pure soul essence, which is definitely devoid of the
five senses of touch etc. Therefore, karmas, whose functions are these happiness
and sorrow, are also murtik, because the function is similar to the cause. The
cause is also known to be murtik from the murtik function-like experience. The
objects of the five senses, such as touch etc., are murtik. And they are enjoyed
by the murtik senses, happiness and sorrow arise from them, which is also murtik
itself. In this way, karma has been proved to be murtik, this is the meaning of
the sutra.  In this way, the third place was completed with one sutra, proving
both types of dravyakarmas, punya and papa, to be murtik, using the division of
nayas to explain to the disciple who relies on the Nyaya view.  **Sutra 134:**
The murtikarma binds the amurtik jiva, and the murtikarma is also bound by the
murtikarma. Just as a mud-ball sticks to a mud-ball, the jiva, devoid of murti,
is caught by them and is bound by them.  **Explanation:** In this samsari jiva,
the murtik karma continues from the beginningless lineage. Because it has touch
etc., the incoming murtik karma touches it, and then that murtik karma
experiences bondage with it due to the quality of affection. This is the type of
bondage of the murtik karma.

##  Chapter 326: Description of the Path to Liberation through the Nine
Substances  **A definitive explanation:** The formless soul, being inherently
pure but tainted by the karmic effects of attachment and other passions, is
specifically drawn to material karmas. It is also specifically drawn to material
karmas by the karmic effects of its own transformations, which are obtained
through material karmas. This is the nature of the mutual entanglement of the
soul and material karmas. Thus, even the formless soul is not free from
entanglement with material karmas, whether they are virtuous or vicious.
**Commentary:** This explains the nature of the entanglement of material karmas
with each other, and the entanglement of the formless soul with material karmas.
In this world, material karmas, which have been flowing continuously since the
beginning of time, are present. Because they are material, they come into
contact with other material karmas, and thus the soul, being attracted to them,
becomes entangled with them. This is the nature of the entanglement of the soul
with material karmas.  Furthermore, the formless soul, being inherently pure but
tainted by the karmic effects of attachment and other passions, is specifically
drawn to material karmas. It is also specifically drawn to material karmas by
the karmic effects of its own transformations, which are obtained through
material karmas. This is the nature of the mutual entanglement of the soul and
material karmas. Thus, even the formless soul is not free from entanglement with
material karmas, whether they are virtuous or vicious.  **End of the explanation
of the substances of virtue and vice.**

Panchastikaya Prabhrita  The mode of bondage of the corporeal karmas is to be
known as follows: The corporeal karmas, by means of their own smooth and rough
transformations, experience a binding in the form of an association. Now, again,
the bondage of the corporeal living being and the corporeal karmas is described.
The soul, devoid of liberation, is, according to the absolute point of view,
non-corporeal, but due to the influence of the beginningless karmic bondage, it
becomes corporeal in the empirical point of view. What does it do? Being
transformed by the sweet taste of the non-corporeal, indivisible, and eternal
blissful nature, it engages those karmic aggregates that are unfit for it, in
the form of mutual interpenetration, and binds them. And they, by the impure
cognition of the soul, also engage the soul, which has become transformed into
karmic nature, in the form of being enveloped, and thus the soul too is bound.
Therefore, even the non-corporeal soul has the possibility of bondage in the
empirical point of view. Thus it is said, "Bondage is certainly of the nature of
the characteristics, and its knowledge is the absence of liberation of the
soul."

##  Translation:  328 The description of the nine substances and the path to
liberation, like the sweet taste of sugar, is opposite to the false view and the
consequences of anger, hatred, etc.  The embodied being, along with its karma-
bandha, gives space to the karmic particles in its own region, which are fit for
karmic aggregation. This means that it binds them. In other words, this being,
through its consequences of attachment, etc., which are contrary to its pure
self-awareness, becomes involved in the aggregation of karmic particles that are
fit for karmic aggregation, and thus becomes bound by them. Here, the idea is
that the being is certainly non-embodied, but practically embodied. This is why
karma-bandha is possible for the being. It is said:  > "There is a mutual
relationship between the being and the particle with respect to karma-bandha,
but they are different in terms of their characteristics. Therefore, the being
is not non-embodied in isolation." || 134 ||  In this way, the fourth section is
complete. Thus, the fifth section, which is an internal section, ends with four
verses, mainly explaining merit and demerit, in the second great authority that
explains the nine substances.  Now, the explanation of the substance of *āsrava*
begins. This is the explanation of the nature of *puṇyāśrava*.  > "The one who
has praiseworthy attachment, a consequence that is based on compassion, and
whose mind is free from defilement, has the *āsrava* of merit." || 135 ||  >
"Praiseworthy attachment, a consequence based on compassion, and a mind free
from defilement - these three auspicious qualities are the cause of the *āsrava*
of material merit, because they are only the cause, and the *āsrava* of mental
merit arises after that *āsrava*. The auspicious karmic consequence that arises
from this, through the door of yoga, is the *āsrava* of material merit for the
particles that enter." || 135 ||  Explanation of the meaning: ( *yasy* ) The
being who ( *praśastaḥ rāgaḥ* ) has praiseworthy attachment, (
*anukampāsaṃśritaḥ pariṇāmaḥ* ) a consequence based on compassion, ( *ca* ) and
( *citte kāluṣyaṃ na asti* ) whose mind is free from defilement, ( *jīvasya* )
that being ( *puṇyaṃ āsravati* ) has the *āsrava* of merit.  Commentary: This is
a statement about the nature of *puṇyāśrava*. Praiseworthy attachment, a
consequence based on compassion, and a mind free from defilement - these three
auspicious qualities are the cause of the *āsrava* of material merit, because
they are only the cause, and the *āsrava* of mental merit arises after that
*āsrava*. The auspicious karmic consequence that arises from this, through the
door of yoga, is the *āsrava* of material merit for the particles that enter.

The **five astikayas** are the cause only in the form of a **nimitta**
(occasion), therefore **dravya punya asrava** is preceded by **bhaava punya
asrava**, and those **shubha bhaava** (auspicious feelings) which are the
occasion for them, are the **dravya punya asrava** which are the result of the
**karma** of the **pudgalas** that enter through the **yoga dvaara** (door of
yoga). || 135 ||  **Saṃ. Tā.** - Now, the **bhaava karma**, **dravya karma**,
**nokarma**, **mati jñāna**, etc., **vibhaava guṇa**, **nara**, **naraka**,
etc., **vibhaava paryāya** are all void, and from the pure **ātman** (soul)
arises the **nirvikalpa samādhi** (meditation without thought) which is
characterized by **abheda ratnatraya** (three jewels of non-duality) in the form
of **śraddhā** (faith), **jñāna** (knowledge), and **anuṣṭhāna** (practice), and
is filled like a full pot with the **samata rasa** (feeling of equality) and
**paramānanda** (supreme bliss). From this **paramātman** (supreme soul) arises
the **shubha** (auspicious) and **aśubha** (inauspicious) **āśrava** (influx).
There are six **gāthā** (verses) on this topic. The first four **gāthā** deal
with **puṇyāśrava** (influx of merit) and begin with the words "**rāgo jassa
pasattho**" (whose passion is auspicious). The next two **gāthā** deal with
**pāpāśrava** (influx of demerit) and begin with the words "**cariyā pamāda
bahulā**" (whose conduct is full of negligence). Thus, this is a **samudāya
pātanikā** (summary) of the **puṇya** and **pāpa āśrava** (influx of merit and
demerit).  Now, the **niraśrava** (without influx) **śuddha ātman** (pure soul)
is described as the opposite of the **shubha āśrava** (auspicious influx) -
"**rāgo jassa pasattho**" (whose passion is auspicious) - the **rāga** (passion)
which is **prashasta** (auspicious) and different from the **vītarāga paramātman
dravya** (soul free from passion), is the **prashasta dharma anurāga**
(attachment to auspicious qualities) which is filled with the **pañca
parameṣṭhin** (five supreme beings). "**aṇukampā saṃsido ya parināmo**" (whose
result is filled with compassion) - the **parināma** (result) which is
**aṇukampā saṃśrita** (filled with compassion) is the **shubha parināma**
(auspicious result) in the form of **mano vacana kāya vyāpāra** (actions of
mind, speech, and body). "**citte niṭṭhi kaluso**" (there is no defilement in
the mind) - there is no **kaluṣa** (defilement) in the **citta** (mind), there
is no **kaluṣa parināma** (result of defilement) like **krodha** (anger) in the
**manas** (mind). "**puṇṇam jīvasa āśavadi**" (whose life is filled with influx
of merit) - the **jīva** (living being) who has these three **shubha parināma**
(auspicious results) has **bhaava puṇya** (merit of feeling) which is the cause
of **dravya puṇya āśrava** (influx of merit of substance). This is the meaning
of the **sūtra** (aphorism). || 135 || Thus, the **shubha āśrava** (auspicious
influx) is explained in the **sūtra gāthā** (verse of the aphorism).
**Pīṭhikā** - Further, this **ātman** (soul) is definitely the **paramātman**
(supreme soul). It is void of **bhaava karma** (karma of feeling), **dravya
karma** (karma of substance), **nokarma** (karma of non-action), **mati jñāna**
(knowledge of the mind), etc., **vibhaava guṇa** (qualities of the object),
**nara** (human), **naraka** (hell), etc., **vibhaava paryāya** (synonyms of the
object). It is the **śuddha ātman** (pure soul) and is filled with the
**nirvikalpa samādhi** (meditation without thought) which is characterized by
the **abheda ratnatraya** (three jewels of non-duality) in the form of
**śraddhā** (faith), **jñāna** (knowledge), and **anuṣṭhāna** (practice), and is
filled like a full pot with the **samata rasa** (feeling of equality) and
**paramānanda** (supreme bliss). From this **paramātman** (supreme soul) arises

## 330 ## Navapadartha - Mokshamarg Varnan (Chitte) In the citta (Kalussam)
there is no kalusapan or impurity (Palthi) (Jivass) for that jiva (Punnam) punya
karma (Asarvadi) comes.  **Special Meaning:**   Vitaraga Paramatma dravya is
distinct from the five Paramesthis like Arhant, Siddha, etc. There is complete
guna-anuraga and that is the praiseworthy dharma-anuraga.  The activities of
mind, speech, and body with compassion are the basis of anukampa.  The impurity
of kshaya like krodha, etc. is called kalushta.  For the jiva whose bhavas have
dharma-prema and daya, and who does not have the impurity of the intensity of
kshaya, for that jiva, these auspicious results are the cause of the asrava of
dravya punya karma, which is called bhava punya asrava.  Here, the nature of
bhava punya asrava is explained in the sutra. || 135 ||  Thus, the gatha is
complete, explaining the auspicious asrava.  **Prashastharaag Swaroop
Akhyanamet**  **Arhant - Siddha - Saahu Su Bhatti Dhammammi Ja Ya Khalu

Arhat, Siddha, and Sadhus, (Dharme Ya Cha Khalu Chesta) Real effort in Dharma,
(Api Guruunam Anugamanam) and following the Gurus, (Prashastharaagah Iti
Bruvanti) is called 'Prashasth Raag'.  **Teeka:** This is the explanation of the
nature of Prashasth Raag.  Devotion towards Arhat, Siddha, and Sadhus, effort in
the practice of Dharma, conduct, and character, and following the Gurus (like
Aachaaryas, etc.) with devotion, is called 'Prashasth Raag' because its object
is praiseworthy.  This (Prashasth Raag) is for the ignorant who are primarily
devoted to devotion (from a gross perspective).  It may also be for the
knowledgeable, when they have not attained stability in the higher realms (above
guna sthana), to prevent the asthana raag or to alleviate the intense fever of
raag. || 136 ||

##  Translation:  **331. Now, the nature of प्रशस्तराग is explained:**  Devotion
to Arhats, Siddhas, and Sadhus; and the effort in Dharma, which is characterized
by auspicious raag (शुभराग) and good conduct (चारित्र). This effort includes
following the teachings (अणुगमण), adhering to the principles (अनुव्रजन), and
living a virtuous life (अनुकूलवृत्ति). This is called प्रशस्तराग, as the
Acharyas say, because it is the devotion to those who have destroyed the eight
roots of karma (ज्ञानावरणादिमूलोत्तरप्रकृतयः) and their sub-categories, through
the practice of Dharma-dhyana and Shukla-dhyana, which are free from the
defilements of raag and other vices. They have become free from the eighteen
defects (क्षुधाधष्टादशदोषरहिताः) and possess the infinite fourfold qualities
(केवलज्ञानाद्यनंतचतुष्टयसहिताः). These are called Arhats.  Those who have
destroyed the eight karmas (ज्ञानावरणाद्यष्टकर्माभावेन) and manifested the eight
virtues (सम्यक्त्वाद्यष्टगुणलक्षणा), residing in the forefront of the world
(लोकाग्रनिवासिनः), are distinct from the worldly Anjan-Siddhas and others, and
are called Siddhas.  The unwavering conviction (निश्चय) in the true nature of
the self (आत्मतत्व), which is characterized by pure knowledge (विशुद्धज्ञान) and
right perception (दर्शन), the renunciation of desire for others' possessions
(परद्रव्येच्छापरिहारेण), the practice of austerity (तपश्चरणं) by focusing on
one's own self (आत्मद्रव्ये प्रतएनं), and the adherence to the principles
(अनुष्ठानम) without relying on external support (स्वशत्त्यनवगृहनेना) - these
constitute the five principles of conduct (निश्चयपंचाचारः). Similarly, the five
principles of conduct based on the scriptures (आचारादिशास्त्रकचित्तक्रमेण),
which are conducive to the practice of these principles
(तत्साधकव्यवहारपंचाचारः), are also followed. Those who practice these principles
themselves (स्वयमाचारंत्यन्यानाचारयंति) and guide others to do the same are
called Acharyas.  Those who explain (कथयंति) and teach (उपादेयं) the nature of
the soul (शुद्धजीवद्रव्यं), the essence of the soul (शुद्धजीवतत्त्वं), and the
true nature of the soul (शुद्धजीवपदार्थं), based on the five categories of
existence (पंचास्तिकाय), the six substances (षडद्रव्य), the seven principles
(सप्ततत्त्व), and the four categories of objects (नपदार्थ), and who also explain
(प्रतिपादयंति) and practice (भावयंति) the path to liberation (मोक्षमार्ग), which
is characterized by the three jewels (भेदाभेदरत्नत्रयलक्षणं), are called
Upadhyayas.  Those who practice the fourfold means of spiritual development
(निश्चयचतुर्विधाराधनया) and strive to realize the true nature of the self
(शुद्धात्मस्वरूपं साधयंति) are called Sadhakas.  Thus, the devotion (भक्तिः) to
Arhats, Siddhas, and Sadhus, as well as to Acharyas, Upadhyayas, and Sadhus,
both externally and internally, is called प्रशस्तराग.  An ignorant soul (अज्ञानी
जीवो) develops this प्रशस्तराग due to the bondage (बंधेन) caused by the desire
for worldly pleasures (भोगाकांक्षारूपनिदान). A wise soul (ज्ञानी
पुनर्निर्विकल्पसमाध्यभावे), on the other hand, develops this प्रशस्तराग to
destroy the inauspicious raag (अशुभराग) that arises from the attachment to
objects (विषयकषायरूपाशुभरागविनाशार्थं). This is the essence of the meaning.
**136.**  **Hindi Translation:**  **उत्थानिका - आगे प्रशस्त राग का स्वरूप कहते
हैं**  **Anvaya (Word Order) with General Meaning:**  (अरहंतसिद्धसाहुसु) In
Arhats, Siddhas, and Sadhus, (भत्ती) devotion (य) and (थम्मम्मि) in the
auspicious raag-based conduct (शुभ रागरूप चारित्रमें) (जा खलु चेट्ठा) the effort
made with conviction (निश्चय करके उद्योग करना च) (गुरूणं पि अणुगमणं) following
the teachings of the Gurus (गुरुओंके अनुकूल चलना) (पसस्थरागो त्ति) this is
प्रशस्तराग (यह प्रशस्तराग है ऐसा) (वुच्चंति) the Acharyas say.  **Specific
Meaning:**  The two wrong meditations (आर्तध्यान व रौद्रध्यान), which are
opposed to the meditation of the faultless Supreme Soul (दोषरहित परमात्माके
ध्यानके विरोधी), bind the eight roots of karma (ज्ञानावरणादि आठमूल) and their
sub-categories (उनके भेदरूप उत्तर प्रकृतियोंका बन्ध होता है). These karmic
formations (कर्मप्रकृतियोंको) are destroyed by the power of Dharma-dhyana and
Shukla-dhyana (रागादि विकल्पोंसे रहित धर्मध्यान और शुक्लध्यानोंके बलसे नाश
करके), which are free from the defilements of raag and other vices. Those who
have become free from the eighteen defects (क्षुधा, तृषा आदि अठारह दोषोंसे रहित
हो) and possess the infinite fourfold qualities (केवलज्ञानादि अनंत अतुष्टय के
धारी हैं) are called Arhats (वे अर्हत कहे जाते हैं). Those who have destroyed
the eight karmas (ज्ञानावरण आदि आठों कर्मोका नाश करके) and manifested the eight
virtues (सम्यग्दर्शन आदि गुणोंको प्रगट करके), residing in the forefront of the
world (लोकके अग्रभागमें निवास प्राप्त करलिया है), are distinct from the worldly
Anjan-Siddhas and others (लौकिक अञ्जनसिद्ध आदिसे विलक्षण), and are called
Siddhas (वे सिद्ध हैं). The unwavering conviction (निश्चय) in the true nature of
the self (आत्मतत्व), which is characterized by pure knowledge (विशुद्ध ज्ञानद

## 332 ## Description of the Path to Liberation through the Nine Substances
**Ruchi** is the certainty of right faith, **Samyakgyan** is the knowledge of
that certainty, and **Samyakcharitra** is the unwavering experience of that
certainty. **Tap** is the intense focus on one's own soul substance, renouncing
the desire for external possessions, and **Voury** is the unhindered effort to
achieve liberation.   Those who practice these five types of **Nischya Achar**
(certain conduct) and the five types of **Vyavahar Achar** (practical conduct)
as described in the scriptures, both practicing them themselves and guiding
others to do so, are **Acharyas**.   Those who teach the **Ratnatraya** (three
jewels) - the **Nischya Vyavahar** (certain practice) - as the path to
liberation, and who themselves embody this path, are **Upadhyayas**.   Those who
practice the four types of **Nischya Aradhana** (certain worship) to purify
their soul are **Sadhus**.   Those who possess the qualities described above,
and who are worthy of being called **Acharyas**, **Upadhyayas**, and **Sadhus**,
are **Jineendras**.   **Prashasta Rag** (noble attachment) is the devotion to
these individuals, both externally and internally.   Ignorant beings experience
this noble attachment due to the **Nidana** (cause) of desire for worldly
pleasures, while enlightened beings experience it to eliminate **Kashaya**
(passions) and **Ashubha Rag** (unwholesome attachment) without attaining
**Nirvikalpa Samadhi** (state of complete absorption).   ## 136  This is a
description of **Anukampa** (compassion).  ## 137  **Tisi** (thirsty),
**Bubhukhid** (hungry), or **Dukhita** (suffering) - whoever sees a **Dukhita**
(suffering) being with a **Dukhita Mano** (suffering mind) and feels compassion
for them, that is **Anukampa**.  ## 137  **Tṛṣita** (thirsty), **Bubhukṣita**
(hungry), or **Duḥkhita** (suffering) - whoever sees a **Duḥkhita** (suffering)
being with a **Duḥkhita Manaḥ** (suffering mind) and feels compassion for them,
that is **Anukampa**.  ## 137  Seeing someone suffering, the ignorant person
feels compassion out of a desire to help them, while the enlightened person
feels sorrow for the suffering of all beings trapped in the ocean of birth and
death.  ## Anvayaartha (Meaning of the Sentence):  **Tṛṣita** (thirsty),
**Bubhukṣita** (hungry), or **Duḥkhita** (suffering) - whoever sees a
**Duḥkhita** (suffering) being with a **Duḥkhita Manaḥ** (suffering mind) and
feels compassion for them, that is **Anukampa**.  ## Tika (Commentary):  This is
a description of the nature of **Anukampa** (compassion).

The compassion of an ignorant person is when, seeing a creature suffering from
thirst, hunger, or other pain, he is filled with anxiety due to compassion and
desires to help. The compassion of a wise person, however, is a slight sorrow in
the mind when observing the world immersed in the ocean of birth, while dwelling
in the lower realms (i.e., when he himself is in the lower stages of spiritual
development).   This is the nature of compassion. When someone sees a creature
suffering from thirst, hunger, or pain, and feels sorrow in his heart, and
accepts that creature with compassion, that is compassion.   For example, an
ignorant being, seeing someone suffering from intense thirst, hunger, or severe
illness, becomes anxious, thinking, "How can I help this person?" and feels
compassion. A wise person, however, not being attached to his own feelings, does
not become agitated by suffering, but instead helps as much as possible, and
feels a special sense of compassion and detachment when seeing someone
suffering. This is the meaning of the sutra.

The description of the path to liberation through the nine substances is purity.
This purity arises in the knower of truth when the passions are completely
destroyed. Sometimes, even the knower experiences this purity in the
intermediate realms, due to the use of the passions, which are not completely
abandoned, following their arising. ||138||  Commentary: This is a statement
about the nature of the defilement of the mind. Defilement is the agitation of
the mind caused by the intense arising of anger, pride, deceit, and greed.
Purity is the calmness of the mind caused by the mild arising of these same
passions. This purity arises in the ignorant when the passions are completely
destroyed. Sometimes, even the knower experiences this purity in the
intermediate realms, due to the use of the passions, which are not completely
abandoned, following their arising. ||138||

The attainment of a pure soul, free from the five astikayas and ego, is opposed
to pride. The attainment of a soul free from the world is opposed to illusion.
The agitation that prevents the satisfaction arising from the contemplation of
the pure soul is called agitation. The agitated state of mind that is opposed to
the experience of the pure soul, free from agitation, is called mental
agitation. The agitation in the mind caused by the intensity of these passions,
such as anger, is called defilement. The state of mind that is opposed to this
defilement is called purity or auspicious attachment, which is in the form of
mild passions. This very state is the cause of the inflow of karmic actions.
This state arises even in an ignorant person with a false view, when the mild
rise of infinite attachment occurs. And this auspicious state arises in a
knowledgeable person when he does not experience the benefit of his own
experience without any defilement, and the knowledgeable person, in order to
avoid wrong meditation, adopts this state of mind, which is in the form of
happiness, as compassion, forgiveness, etc. || 138 ||  Thus, the causes of the
inflow of auspicious karmic actions have been explained in four verses.  This is
the description of the nature of the inflow of inauspicious karmic actions. The
conduct full of carelessness, the defilement, the fickleness in the objects, the
causing of sorrow to others, and the slander of others, all these cause the
inflow of inauspicious karmic actions. || 139 ||  The conduct full of
carelessness, the defilement, the fickleness in the objects, the causing of
sorrow to others, and the slander of others, all these cause the inflow of
inauspicious karmic actions. || 139 ||  The culmination of conduct full of
carelessness, the culmination of defilement, the culmination of fickleness in
the objects, the culmination of causing sorrow to others, and the culmination of
slander of others, these five inauspicious states are the mere causes of the
inflow of material inauspicious karmic actions, because they are the cause of
the inflow of material inauspicious karmic actions. Therefore, the inflow of
mental inauspicious karmic actions precedes the inflow of material inauspicious
karmic actions. And those [inauspicious states] which are their cause, the
inauspicious karmic results of the pudgalas that enter through yoga, are the
inflow of material inauspicious karmic actions. || 139 ||  Meaning of the text:
(Conduct full of carelessness) very careless conduct, (defilement) defilement,
(fickleness in the objects) fickleness towards objects, (causing sorrow to
others and slander of others) causing sorrow to others and speaking ill of
others, that (causes the inflow of inauspicious karmic actions) causes the
inflow of inauspicious karmic actions.  Commentary: This is the statement of the
nature of the inflow of inauspicious karmic actions.  The culmination of conduct
full of carelessness, the culmination of fickleness in the objects, the
culmination of causing sorrow to others (the culmination of causing suffering to
others), and the culmination of slander of others - these five inauspicious
states are the mere causes of the inflow of material inauspicious karmic
actions, therefore, the inflow of mental inauspicious karmic actions precedes
the inflow of material inauspicious karmic actions.  And those [inauspicious
states] which are their cause, the inauspicious karmic results of the pudgalas
that enter through yoga, are the inflow of material inauspicious karmic actions.

## Translation:  **Verse 9211**  This verse describes the path to liberation
through the nine substances. It explains the nature of the five types of
*papasrava* (karmic influx).  **Commentary:**  * **Pramada-bahula charya:** A
course of action characterized by excessive carelessness, hindering the
attainment of the state of pure consciousness. * **Kalushya-parinati:** A state
of defilement, the opposite of the state of pure consciousness. * **Vishaya-
lolita-parinati:** A state of excessive attachment to sensory objects, hindering
the experience of inner peace. * **Para-paritapa-parinati:** A state of causing
suffering to others, contrary to the experience of pure compassion. * **Para-
apavada-parinati:** A state of criticizing others, the opposite of self-
awareness.  These five states are called *bhaava-papasrava* (karmic influx
arising from mental states) because they are the cause of *dravya-papasrava*
(karmic influx affecting the physical body). *Dravya-papasrava* is the result of
actions performed through the mind, speech, and body, motivated by these five
states.  **Verse 140**  This verse further elaborates on the nature of
*papasrava*.  **Commentary:**  * **Sanjnaa:** The three types of *leshya*
(subtle karmic tendencies) - *tiivra* (intense), *indriya-vashada* (controlled
by the senses), and *attaroudra* (cruel). * **Gyaana:** Knowledge that is
misused, leading to *moha* (delusion). * **Moha:** Delusion, which is the root
cause of *papasrava*.  The verse also mentions the three types of *leshya* -
*krishna* (black), *neela* (blue), and *kapota* (grey) - which are associated
with the three *kashya* (passions) - *raaga* (attachment), *dvesha* (aversion),
and *moha* (delusion). These *leshya* are the result of the *yoga* (actions)
motivated by the three *kashya*.

The five types of *āsrava* are:  1. **Ārtta** (distress): This arises from the
desire for the cessation of pain, the desire for the attainment of pleasure, and
the desire for the means to achieve these ends. 2. **Roudra** (cruelty): This
arises from the *kaṣāya* (passions) of anger, hatred, and greed, and manifests
as violence, lying, stealing, and the enjoyment of sensual pleasures. 3.
**Duṣṭa-jñāna** (misguided knowledge): This is knowledge that is used for evil
purposes, even though it may be derived from good sources. 4. **Moha**
(delusion): This arises from the obscuration of the true nature of reality by
the *kaṣāya* and manifests as ignorance, confusion, and attachment to the world.
These four types of *āsrava* are the causes of *dravya-pāpa-āsrava* (the
*āsrava* that leads to the accumulation of karmic matter).

The question arises as to why the explanation of the path to liberation through
the nine substances is being given. The Acharya explains this by saying that
just as water enters through a doorway, so too does the influx of karmic matter
(āsrava) of both merit and demerit through the doorway of emotions (bhāva).
Here, the entry is the main point, but in the case of merit and demerit, the
main point is their staying on after entry in the form of the states of
existence (sthiti), experience (anubhāga), and bondage (bandha). Thus, in the
second major section dealing with the nine substances, the explanation of the
influx of merit and demerit is mainly concluded in the sixth chapter of the
sixth section.  The Hindi translation says: "Further, the explanation of the
influx of demerit is given in detail."  The general meaning with the grammatical
structure is: [Saṇṇāo] four designations, [Ya] and [Tilesa] three blemishes
(Indriyavasada) being under the control of the senses (Ya) and (Attaruhaṇi)
agitated, fierce meditation, [Duppouttam ṇāṇam] knowledge applied to wrong
actions (Cha) and (Moho) delusion, all these (Pāvaṇyadā) are givers of demerit
(Hoti) are.  The specific meaning is: These four designations, namely food,
fear, sexual intercourse, and possessions, are different from the pure
consciousness that is devoid of designations like food, etc. The three
inauspicious blemishes, namely black, blue, and dove-colored, are those that
retain the characteristics of the tendency of the yogas, which are colored by
the arising of the passions, and are distinct from the pure consciousness that
is free from both passions and yogas. The dependence on the objects of the five
senses is the covering of the culmination of the taste of the independent,
transcendental pleasure. The four types of agitated meditation are those that
are filled with the desire for the four causes, namely, favorable conjunction,
unfavorable separation, destruction of disease, and enjoyment, which obstruct
the feeling of pure consciousness that is devoid of all desires. The four types
of fierce meditation are those that arise from a wicked mind that is distant
from the feeling of pure consciousness that is devoid of the force of anger, and
are involved in the protection of violence, lying, stealing, and possessions.
The knowledge that is applied to any other evil state, abandoning both good use
and pure use, and being under the control of false views and passions, is called
misused knowledge. The delusion that destroys the self-realization that is
devoid of the network of alternatives like egotism, etc., which arises from the
arising of delusion, is called the delusion of perception and the delusion of
conduct. This is the elaborate explanation of the various states and emotions.
All these emotions are the cause of the influx of karmic matter of demerit.
Thus, one should understand the expansion of the influx of demerit, which is
caused by the influx of karmic matter of demerit, as mentioned in the previous
sutra. This is the meaning.  Here, someone might ask, "Why is the explanation of
the influx of merit and demerit being given when both merit and demerit had
already been discussed earlier?" The Acharya answers this by saying that just as
water enters through a doorway, so too does the influx of karmic matter (āsrava)
of both merit and demerit through the doorway of emotions (bhāva). Here, the
entry is the main point, but in the case of merit and demerit, the main point is
their staying on after entry in the form of the states of existence (sthiti),
experience (anubhāga), and bondage (bandha).

The **Panchaastikaya** primarily discusses the **punya** (merit) and **papa**
(demerit) and their **sthiti** (state) and **anubhag** (experience) as
**bandha** (bondage). This is its special characteristic. In this way, the sixth
**antaradhikār** (sub-chapter) of the second **mahaadhikār** (major chapter)
dealing with the **navapadaartha** (nine substances) is completed with the
explanation of **āsrava** (influx) of **punya** and **papa** through six
**gāthās** (verses).  Now, the explanation of **sanvara** (restriction) is
given.  **Anvayārtha** (meaning): Those who remain on the **samyag** (right)
path [**sanvaramārga** (path of restriction)], by restraining the **indriya**
(senses), **kaṣāya** (passions), and **saṁjñā** (perceptions) to the extent they
do, to that extent the **pāpāsrava** (influx of demerit) is blocked for them.
**Tīkā** (commentary): This explanation of **sanvara** is given because **papa**
is **ananta** (infinite).  The **mārga** (path) is actually **sanvara**
(restriction), and by its means (cause), the **indriya**, **kaṣāya**, and
**saṁjñā** are restrained to the extent or for the time they are restrained, to
that extent or for that time the **pāpāsrava** (influx of demerit) is blocked.
The **indriya**, **kaṣāya**, and **saṁjñā** are the cause [**nimitta**] of
**bhāvapāpāsrava** (influx of demerit in the form of emotions), which is the
cause of **dravyapapāsrava** (influx of demerit in the form of matter) as
explained earlier (in the 140th verse). Here, their restraint is the cause of
**bhāvapāpasamvara** (restriction of demerit in the form of emotions) and
**dravyapapāsrava** (restriction of demerit in the form of matter), which should
be understood. ||141||  **Saṁ. Tā.** (Summary): This verse, beginning with
"**Indriyakaṣāya**", is a **samudāyapātanikā** (verse that destroys a group of
things) in the explanation of **sanghara** (restriction) which is achieved by
**paramopekshā** (supreme indifference) **saṁyama** (self-control) that is free
from all **śubhāśubha** (auspicious and inauspicious) **saṁkalpa** (thoughts)
and **vikalpa** (doubts) and is characterized by **śuddhātmasamvitti** (pure
self-awareness) which is the result of **nidānabandha** (bondage due to causes)
such as **kāṁkṣā** (desire) for **bhoga** (enjoyment) and **dṛṣṭaśruta** (seen
and heard) **pujālābha** (honor and gain).

The text describes the path to liberation (moksha) through the cessation of
karmic influx (papasrava). It states that the senses, passions (kṣayās), and the
four types of food (āhāras) are restrained and prohibited by those who are the
doers (kartṛbhūta) and who are particularly well-established (sudu-suṣṭhu) on
the path. How are they restrained? As long as they remain in a particular state
of being (guṇasthāna) for a certain period of time, the karmic influx is
stopped. This is explained in the following verse:  "Sixteen, twenty-five, nine,
ten, six, thirty-two, four, sixteen, and one" (sōlasa paṇavīs ṇabhaṁ dasa cara
chakkēkk bandhavōchhiṇā | dugatīs caḍurapuñce paṇa sōlasa jōgiṇō ēkkō').  This

English translation preserving Jain terms:  This is an explanation of the
general nature of Punya (merit) and Papa (demerit) Samvara (restraint).  Whose
(Yasya) - the one who (na vidyate) does not have (rago) attachment, (doso)
aversion, (moho va) or delusion (sarva-dravyesu) towards all substances.  For
that Bhikshu (ascetic) who has equanimity towards pleasure and pain, (na
astravaati) the (shubham) auspicious and (ashubham) inauspicious karmas do not
flow in (samasu-kha-duhkhasya) as he is equipoised in happiness and sorrow.
This is the description of the general nature of Samvara. The cessation of the
transformations of delusion, attachment and aversion is Bhava-samvara (intrinsic
restraint). And the cessation of the transformations of auspicious and
inauspicious karmas entering the soul, which occurs through Yoga (spiritual
effort), is Dravya-samvara (practical restraint).

##  342 ##  Navapadartha - Mokshamarga Varnan ##  Shubhashubhakarma  **What?**
For the Bhikkhu, it is the **tapodhana** (one who has wealth of austerities)
with **shuddhoupayoga** (pure utilization) devoid of raga (attachment), dvesha
(aversion), and moha (delusion).  **How?**  **Samasuhdukkhasya** (one who is
equal in happiness and sorrow) -
**Shuddhatmadhyanotpannaparamasukhamritatriptirūpaikākārasamarasībhāva-balena**
(by the strength of the one-pointedness of the state of equanimity, which is the
form of supreme bliss-nectar-satisfaction, born from pure self-meditation)
**anabhivyaktasukhad rūpaharshavidavikāratvāt** (because of the absence of the
manifestation of the modifications of happiness, form, joy, and sorrow).
**Therefore, Samasuhdukkhasya** (one who is equal in happiness and sorrow).
**Here, shuddhoupayoga** (pure utilization) **capable of shubhashubhasanvara**
(restraint of auspicious and inauspicious actions) is **bhavasanvara**
(restraint of emotions). **Bhavasanvara** (restraint of emotions) is the
foundation for **navatarakarmnirōdha** (cessation of new karmas), which is
**dravya sanvara** (restraint of matter). This is the meaning. || 142 ||
**Hindi Ta. -**  Uthānikā -  Further, we will discuss the nature of the general
auspicious and inauspicious karma-restraint.  **Anvaya Saha Samanyārtha -**
(Jass)  Whose (Savvadavvesu) in all substances (Rago Dosō Mohō vā) attachment,
aversion, and delusion (Na) are not (Vijjadi) present, that (Samasuhdukkhasya)
one who is equal in happiness and sorrow (Bhikkhussa) the virtuous one (Suhan
Asuhan) auspicious or inauspicious karma (Nasavdi) do not arise.  **Visheshārtha
-** The true nature of the supreme dharma of the jiva is pure emotion, which is
the opposite of attachment, aversion, and delusion. That virtuous one, who is a
**tapodhana** (one who has wealth of austerities), is endowed with
**shuddhoupayoga** (pure utilization) devoid of attachment, aversion, and
delusion. He is free from all auspicious and inauspicious thoughts. He is
satisfied with the supreme bliss-nectar, which arises from pure self-meditation.
He does not allow the modifications of happiness, sorrow, joy, and sorrow to
arise within him. Such a virtuous one, who is equal in happiness and sorrow,
does not have the inflow of auspicious and inauspicious karma. Here,
**shuddhoupayoga** (pure utilization) capable of restraining auspicious and
inauspicious emotions is **bhavasanvara** (restraint of emotions).
**Bhavasanvara** (restraint of emotions) is the foundation for
**navatarakarmnirōdha** (cessation of new karmas), which is **dravya sanvara**
(restraint of matter). This is the meaning. || 142 ||  **Visheshēna

(Muni) (Yoge) In Yoga (Punyam Papam Cha) Merit and Demerit (Yada) When (Khalu)

specifically is the statement of the nature of restraint. The Yogi, who is
restrained, meaning completely withdrawn, in Yoga - speech, mind and body
related actions - when merit, which is the form of auspicious result, and
demerit, which is the form of inauspicious result, do not exist, then he, due to
the absence of the cause of the Shubhashubhabhavakrit dravyakarma, has
restraint. Therefore, here (in this verse) the meaning of restraint of merit and
demerit, which is the form of restraint of auspicious and inauspicious results,
should be understood as the main cause of restraint of dravyapunya and
dravyappapa. || 143 || Thus, the explanation of the object of restraint is

## Tayartha - Description of the Path to Liberation **344**  Thus, in the second
great authority, which speaks of new substances, three stanzas are completed
with the explanation of the substance of *samvara*. The seventh inner authority
is finished.  **Now, the explanation of the substance of *nirjara***  This is
the explanation of the nature of *nirjara*.  **[144]** *He who is united with
*samvara* and *yoga*, by means of various austerities, constantly destroys many
karmas.*  **Explanation:**  *Samvara* is the cessation of the results of good
and bad karma, and *yoga* is pure utilization. He who is united with these two (
*samvara* and *yoga* ), by means of external austerities such as fasting, non-
attachment, counting of breaths, renunciation of taste, solitary bed and seat,
and bodily austerities, and by means of internal austerities such as atonement,
humility, conduct, self-study, renunciation, and meditation - thus, he who
engages in various austerities, truly destroys many karmas. Therefore, here [in
this stanza, it is said that] pure utilization, which is strengthened by
external and internal austerities, is capable of destroying the power of karma,
and by its influence, the destruction of a part of the accumulated karmic
matter, which has become tasteless, is the destruction of the substance of
karma.   **[144]**  Now, there is the explanation of the substance of *nirjara*.
**Meaning:**  [He who is united with *samvara* and *yoga*] He who is united with
*samvara* and *yoga* (pure utilization), [by means of various austerities]
engages in various austerities, [he] constantly destroys many karmas.
**Commentary:**  This is the statement of the nature of *nirjara*.  *Samvara*
means the cessation of the results of good and bad karma, and *yoga* means pure
utilization. He who is united with these two (*samvara* and *yoga*), by means of
external austerities such as fasting, non-attachment, counting of breaths,
renunciation of taste, solitary bed and seat, and bodily austerities, and by
means of internal austerities such as atonement, humility, conduct, self-study,
renunciation, and meditation - thus, he who engages in various austerities,
truly destroys many karmas. Therefore, here [in this stanza, it is said that]
pure utilization, which is strengthened by external and internal austerities, is
capable of destroying the power of karma, and by its influence, the destruction
of a part of the accumulated karmic matter, which has become tasteless, is the
destruction of the substance of karma.

**Pancastikaya Prabhrut**  345. The text now describes the nature of Nirjara. It
says, "Sanvara Jogehin Judo" - one who is united with Sanvara Yoga, through the
power of pure self-realization, is Sanvara, which is the cessation of the
results of good and bad karma. The Yoga, which is described by the word
"Nirvikalpa Lakshana Dhyana", is pure use. One who is united with these two, and
who strives through various forms of tapas, is the one who destroys many karmas.
**Anvaya Sahait Samaanyarth** - (The one) who is virtuous (Sanvara Jogehin Judo)
is united with Sanvara and Yoga, or pure use, and (Bahuvehihin Tavehi) through
various forms of tapas (Chitthade) strives for the highest good (So) he
(Bahugaan Kamman) destroys many karmas (Nijjaran) (Niyadam Kunadi) for sure.
**Vishesharth** - The cessation of good and bad karmas through the power of pure
self-realization is Sanvara. The pure use, which is described by the word
"Nirvikalpa Lakshana Dhyana", is Yoga. The external six types of tapas that are
conducive to pure self-realization are: Anashana (fasting), Adamoudarya (control
of the senses), Vrittiparisankhyan (counting of thoughts), Rasaparitayaga
(renunciation of taste), Vivikta Shayyanasana (sitting and lying in solitude),
and Kayaklesha (physical austerities). The internal six types of tapas are:
Prayaschitta (atonement), Vinaya (humility), Vaiyaavrittya (study of
scriptures), Swaadhyaaya (self-study), Vyutsarga (renunciation), and Dhyana
(meditation). These six tapas are the natural purification of one's own self.
The virtuous one who is united with Sanvara and Yoga, and who practices these
twelve types of tapas, surely destroys many karmas. The meaning here is that the
pure use, which is the state of being free from attachment and filled with
supreme bliss, is achieved through the practice of these twelve types of tapas.
This pure use is capable of eradicating the root of karmas. The destruction of
the karmic particles, which were previously bound, through the power of this
pure use, is called Dravya Nirjara. 144.

Translation preserving Jain terms:  The main exposition of the cause of nirjara
(shedding of karmas) is presented here.  He who is endowed with samvara
(stoppage of influx of new karmas), who is the true accomplisher of his own
spiritual good, having known the self, meditates steadfastly on the knowledge,
he shakes off the dust of karmas. (145)  Commentary: The one who is endowed with
samvara, i.e., the one who is equipped with the complete cessation of auspicious
and inauspicious dispositions, who has thoroughly understood the true nature of
the object (the distinction between what is to be avoided and what is to be
accepted), whose intellect is turned away from others' interests, and whose mind
is solely engaged in accomplishing his own purpose - such a being, having
directly experienced the self, contemplates that very knowledge steadfastly. He,
indeed, is completely devoid of attachment, purified of the stickiness of
attachment, like a pure crystal pillar, shakes off the dust of previously
accumulated karmas.  This shows that meditation is the principal cause of
nirjara (shedding of karmas).

The soul, through the knowledge of the distinct unity of the qualities and the
qualified, which is the result of the knowledge of the distinct unity, becomes
the meditator. The meditator is the one who has the characteristics mentioned
earlier and meditates on the Supreme Soul. What does he do? He destroys the
karma - he destroys the karma dust. Here, the meaning of the sutra is that
meditation is the cause of the destruction of karma. ||145||  The Hindi
translation states that meditation is the main cause of the destruction of
karma.  The general meaning with the word order: (He) (who is united with
restraint) united with restraint (who is the seeker of the nature of the soul)
the seeker of the nature of the soul (by) by certainty (himself) the soul
(knowing) knowing (steady) steady [knowledge] the knowledge of the soul [is] is
the meditator (he) he [karma] the dust of karma [destroys] destroys.  The
specific meaning: Whoever is united with the restraint of good and bad passions,
etc., and who, understanding the essence of what is to be abandoned and what is
to be accepted, removes himself from other purposes and becomes the seeker of
the pure soul experience, and who, knowing the soul as the eternal, blissful,
one form, free from passions, etc., through the knowledge of self-awareness,
becomes steady in the soul, and who meditates on the soul with the unwavering
meditation of the attainment of the steady soul, which is the result of the
knowledge of the distinct unity of the qualities and the qualified, becomes the
meditator of the Supreme Soul. He destroys the karma dust. In fact, meditation
is the cause of the destruction of karma. This is the meaning of this sutra.
||145||  This is the explanation of the nature of meditation. For one who does
not have passion, hatred, delusion, or the karma of the path, the fire of
meditation, which burns good and bad karma, arises. ||146||  For one who does
not have passion, hatred, delusion, or the karma of the path, the fire of
meditation, which burns good and bad karma, arises. ||146||  The pure,
unwavering consciousness is meditation. Now, the method of attaining the soul is
explained. When the yogi, due to the karma of the path, has collected the karma
of seeing, conduct, and delusion, and then, turning away from the continuation
of that karma, he places himself in the pure soul, free from attachment,
aversion, and hatred, with unwavering steadiness, then, because his
consciousness, which is the form of inaction, is at rest, his speech, mind, and
body, engaged in their own work, are capable of burning all good and bad karma
as fuel, and meditation, which is like fire, arises, which is the cause of the
attainment of the highest goal. Thus it is said:

348 .. Description of the nine substances and the path to liberation "Even now,
by purifying the three jewels, one attains Indrahood. From there, by becoming a
human, one attains liberation." "The scriptures are endless, time is short, and
we are dull-witted. Therefore, only that which destroys old age and death is
worth learning." ||146|| Thus ends the explanation of the Nirjara substance.
Anvaya-artha (Yasy) For whom (Moha; Raga: Dvesha) delusion, attachment, and
aversion (Na vidyate) do not exist (Va) and (Yoga-parikarma) the practice of
yogas is not there (i.e., indifference in mind, speech, and body), (Tasy) for
him (Ramake) (Shubhashubha-dahanah) the fire that burns the auspicious and
inauspicious (Dhyanamaya: Agni) the fire of meditation (Jayate) manifests.
Commentary—This is a statement about the nature of meditation. Pure, unwavering,
and unchanging consciousness is true meditation. The method of its manifestation
is now being described—When a yogi truly experiences the ripening of the karmas
that cause delusion in perception and conduct, and he contracts that ripening
into karmas (which are inanimate and different from himself), then, according to
that ripening, he turns away from the use (i.e., he stops the flow of karmas
according to that ripening), and he makes that use, which is not deluded,
attached, or averse, completely pure and merges it into the soul. Then, for that
yogi, who is resting in his inactive, conscious nature, speech, mind, and body
are not pleasing (he does not experience them) and he does not engage in his own
actions. Because he is capable of burning all auspicious and inauspicious
karmas, which are like fuel, meditation, which is like fire, manifests, and it
is the means to achieve the ultimate goal. Then it is said, "Even now, by
purifying the three jewels, one attains Indrahood. From there, by becoming a
human, one attains liberation." "The scriptures are endless, time is short, and
we are dull-witted. Therefore, only that which destroys old age and death is
worth learning." In these two quoted verses, the first verse is from the
Mokshapraabhrut, written by Shrimad Bhagavat Kundakundaacharya Dev. Meaning—Even
now, by meditating on the soul through the three jewels, one attains Indrahood
and the state of a Lokantik Dev, and from there, by becoming a human (i.e., by
taking birth as a human), one attains liberation. The scriptures are endless,
time is short, and we are dull-witted. Therefore, only that which destroys old
age and death is worth learning. ||146|| —Thus ends the explanation of the
Nirjara substance.  Santao.—Now, previously, the cause of Nirjara was described
as meditation. Here, the materials and characteristics of its origin are
explained. Jass Na Vijjadi—For whom it does not exist. Who is that? Rago Dosho
Moho Va—Attachment, aversion, and delusion, or the body born from the arising of
delusion in perception and conduct.

## Translation:  **Pancastikaya Prabhruta** 349  The consequence of raga
(attachment) and dvesha (aversion) is moha (delusion), which is distinct from
the supreme self, characterized by the absence of the network of vikalpa (false
perceptions) and the presence of qualities like pure self-awareness. Or, it is
the consequence of moha (delusion). Again, what is not present in the yogi? The
consequence of yoga is the activity of mind, speech, and body, which is the
opposite of the nature of the supreme self, characterized by the absence of the
karma-kanda (actions) of auspicious and inauspicious karma, and the presence of
the jnana-kanda (knowledge) in the form of pure, inactive, and conscious
evolution. This is the material for meditation. Now, the definition of
meditation is stated.   **Tassuhasuhadhano jhanamo jaayade agani** - For him,
the fire of meditation arises, characterized by the power to burn the fuel of
auspicious and inauspicious karma, which is the result of the wonder of inactive
and pure consciousness. Thus, just as even a small fire burns a large pile of
grass and wood in a short time, so too, the fire of meditation, ignited by the
great wind of the abandonment of the false views and kshaya (passions), and
nourished by the ghee of extraordinary joy and happiness, burns the pile of
karma-fuel, which is different from the root and other natures, in a moment.
Here, the disciple says: "Meditation does not exist in this age. Why? Because of
the absence of the fourteen purva (previous scriptures) and the absence of the
first samhana (assembly)."  The objection is countered: "There is no white
meditation in this age. Thus, it is said in the Moksha Prabhruta by Sri
Kundakunda Acharya:  "**Bharhe dussamakale dhammajhanam havei naniss. Tam
appasahavavide na hu mannai so du annani**" "**Ajjavi tiyarana - Suddha appa
jhaavi lahai indattan. Loyantiya devattan tasy chuda nivvudin janti.**"  Here,
the reasoning is given: "If, in this age, there is no certain conduct as
described in the scriptures, then let the ascetics practice the conduct of raga
(attachment), which is devoid of restraint. Thus, it is said in the
Tattvanusasana Dhyana Grantha:  "**Charitaro na santi adya yathakyatasya
samprati. Tatkimanye yatha shakti macarantu tapodhanaha**"  What is said about
the meditation of those who hold all the scriptures is a general statement. In
the explanation of exceptions, however, only the knowledge of the scriptures
that expound the five samiti (assemblies) and three gupti (secrets) leads to
omniscience. If this is not the case, then how can the statement "**Tusasamsam
dhoto tribhudi kevali jado**" and so on be true? Thus, it is said in the
Charitrasara and other scriptures during the explanation of the five nirgratha
(liberated) states, starting with the pulaka (hair-raising) state: "Those who
attain omniscience after a moment are called nirgratha. Those who are in the
state of kshaya (passions) are called nirgratha. Their knowledge of the fourteen
purva is excellent, and their knowledge of the five samiti and three gupti,
which are eight in number, is inferior.  What is said about the meditation that
arises from the first samhana, which is called Vajravrishabhanaracha, is also a
general statement. The explanation of exceptions is that for those who are in
the state of the highest qualities, the white meditation is a rule, but it is
not a prohibition for those who are in the lower states of qualities. It is not
a prohibition for those who are in the lower states of qualities. Thus, it is
said in the Tattvanusasana:  "**Anto natthi sudinam kalo thoo vayam cha dummeha.
Tapanavari sikkhiyam jam jaramarana khayam kunai.**"  "**Yatpunarvajrakaayasya
dhyanamityagame vacaha. Shrenyor dhyanam pratitiyoctum
tannaathastannisedhakam.**"  Thus, knowing that meditation can be attained even
with a small amount of scripture, one should accept the essence of the
teachings, which is the purification of the self, the destruction of the samvara
(restraint), the removal of the nirjara (decay), and the destruction of old age
and death, and practice meditation. It is said:

The chapter on Nirjara, the main topic of the second major chapter on the path
to liberation and the nine substances, is concluded in the eighth chapter of the
Yoga section.    **General Meaning with Anvaya:**  "The one who does not have
(vijjati) attachment (rago), aversion (doso), delusion (moho), and the actions
of mind, speech, and body (jonaparikammo) within them (tassa), that one (jassa)
has (jayae) the fire of meditation (jhanamo) that burns (suhasuhadhano) both
good and bad emotions (agani) within them."  **Specific Meaning:**  The result
of attachment, aversion, and delusion is distinct from the pure soul, which is
free from the entanglement of attachment (mamata) in the form of choices arising
from the emergence of karma, and is free from delusion, and is filled with
qualities like experience.  The result of actions of mind, speech, and body is
called the result of yoga, which is opposite to the supreme soul, which is free
from the actions of good and bad karma, and is filled with the knowledge that is
the culmination of pure consciousness.  The one who has neither attachment,
aversion, delusion, nor the actions of yoga is the meditator.  This is said to
be the main material for meditation.  Now, the characteristics of meditation are
described.  The fire of meditation is that which is strong enough to burn the
fuel of good and bad karma.  The yogi who has this fire of meditation within
them will be fulfilled by the wonder of pure consciousness, free from defilement
and action.  Just as a small fire can burn a large pile of grass and wood in a
short time, so too, the fire of meditation, which is the experience of the
unshakeable soul, fueled by the great power of renunciation of false views,
passions, and other obstacles, and nourished by the nectar of supreme bliss,
which is unprecedented and wonderful, burns the pile of karma, which is of many
forms due to the differences in the root and the subsequent nature, in an
instant.  **Student's Objection and Acharya's Response:**  Here, the student
says, "Meditation cannot happen in this fifth time period, because there are
neither the Shruta-knowing men who have the ten previous and fourteen previous
vows, nor the first unification."  The Acharya resolves this doubt by saying,
"There is no white meditation in this fifth time period, as Shri Kundakunda
Acharya himself has said in the Mokshapahuḍ.  In this fifth time period of
suffering in the Bharat Kshetra, the right faith meditation can happen for the
right faith knowing one, and it happens for the one who knows the nature of the
soul.  The one who does not believe this is ignorant.  Even now, one can attain
the state of Indra and the state of worldly gods by meditating on the soul,
keeping the mind, speech, and body pure.  From there, one can go to liberation."

Pancastikaya Prabhrut 351 This is also called a reasoning. If in this time,
there cannot be a Yathakyata Charitra, then let the Tapasvijan who have lost
their Samyama, follow the Saraga Charitra. As it is said in Tattvanusasan, If in
this time, there are no holders of Yathakyata Charitra, then should other
Tapasvi not follow Charitra as much as they can? This which is said that the
holders of Sarva Shrutajan have Dhyana, is Utsarga, that is, an excellent
statement. In the exception form or in the medium explanation, it is said that
the knowledge of only Shruta, which tells about the five Samiti and three
Guptika, leads to Kevalgyan. If this does not happen, then how can this be
proven, as it is said, "Tus Masam Ghosanto Sivabhuudo Kevali Jado", that is,
just like Tus (husk) and Mas (black gram) or Dal (pulse) are different,
similarly, Atma is different from Anatma, thus proclaiming, Shivabhudi Muni
became Kevalgyani. Similarly, in Charitrasaradi Granthas, it is said in the
explanation of Palak etc. five Nirmath Munis. Those who can generate Kevalgyan
in a Muhurta (moment) are called Nirmath. They are the ones who are in the
twelfth Gunasthan, called Kshina Kshaya. They have the knowledge of the
excellent Shruta, fourteen Purva, and the knowledge of the lowest five Samiti
and three Guptika, that is, the knowledge of eight Pravachan Matrika. And this
which is said that Dhyana happens from the first Sanhanan, called
Vajravrishabhanaracha, is also Utsarga Vachan. The exception explanation is that
in the Upshama and Kshapaka category, which are in the Aaprava etc. Gunasthan,
there is Shukla Dhyana, and compared to that, the rule of the superior Sanhanan
is there. There is no prohibition of Dharma Dhyana for those who have other
Sanhanan below the Aaprava Gunasthan. Similarly, it is said in Tattvanusasan,
What is said here in the Agam about the Dhyana of Vanakaya, is said taking into
account the Shukla Dhyana compared to the category, there is no prohibition of
Dhyana below the category. In this way, knowing that Dhyana happens even from a
little knowledge of Shruta, it is appropriate to do Dhyana by accepting the
essence of the teachings, which are the cause of Sanvar and Nirjara, which tell
about the pure Atma, and which remove Jara and Maran. This is the feeling. It is
also said, There is no end to the Shastras, the time of life is short, our
intellect is small, therefore, we should learn only that which destroys Jara and
Maran. 146.

## The Explanation of the Bond (Bandha)  This is the explanation of the nature
of the bond (bandha).   **Verse 147:**  If the soul (atma) is attached (rakta)
to a manifested (udirna) state of either auspicious (shubha) or inauspicious
(ashubha) feeling, then it becomes bound (baddha) by that feeling through
various types of karmic matter (pudgala karma).  **Commentary:**  This is a
statement about the nature of the bond.   In reality, this soul, being attached
(rakta) from the beginning of time due to its dependence on external objects,
creates auspicious or inauspicious feelings that manifest due to the influence
of karmic fruition (karma-udaya). Thus, the soul becomes bound by those
feelings, which are the causes, through various types of karmic matter.
Therefore, it is said here that the attachment (snigdha) of the soul to
auspicious or inauspicious states due to delusion (moha), attachment (raga), and
aversion (dvesha) is called "feeling-bond" (bhaav-bandha).   And the mutual
immersion (urchhana) of the karmic matter (pudgala) that has transformed into
auspicious or inauspicious karma, along with the soul, is called "substance-
bond" (dravya-bandha).  **Summary:**  This section explains the concept of
"bond" (bandha) in Jainism, which refers to the attachment of the soul to the
material world through karmic matter. The bond is created by the soul's
attachment to feelings, which are influenced by karmic fruition. This attachment
leads to the soul's entanglement with the material world, hindering its
liberation (moksha).

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):  Panchastikaya Prabhrita 353. Being
devoid of any external conditioning, the pure soul, endowed with the qualities
of untainted knowledge and bliss, undergoes a transformation and assumes a
favorable or unfavorable state, departing from its own self-awareness. This is
how the bondage occurs - the soul, through its state of attachment, becomes the
agent of bondage. What is the instrumental cause? It is the manifold karmic
matter - the various karmic aggregates in the form of material particles.  Here,
the transformation into favorable or unfavorable states, contrary to the pure
nature of the soul, is the bondage of state (bhava-bandha). Due to this, there
is an association of karmic matter with the impure, attached soul, just as the
impurity binds to those anointed with oil, and this is the bondage of substance
(dravya-bandha). This is the purport of the sutra.  148. This explains the
external and internal causes of bondage. The instrumental cause of yoga
(activity) is yoga arising from mind, speech, and body. The causal factor of
bondage is the state (bhava) endowed with attachment, aversion, and delusion.

##  354 **Description of the Nine Substances and the Path to Liberation**  _The
**grahana** (acceptance) of karma-pudgalas is their entry into the karma-skandha

by jiva-bhava. It is the state of being characterized by attachment, aversion,

inducing karma.  Here, the external cause of bondage is yoga, which is the cause
of the acceptance of karma-pudgalas. The internal cause of bondage is the
karmas, which are the cause of the specific power and state of karma-pudgalas.

## Pancastikaya Prabhruta 355  **Hindi 010 - Utghaanika - Further explains the
external and internal causes of bondage.**  **General Meaning with Anvaya:**
(Joganimittan) Due to the cause of yoga, karma pudgalas are taken (Jogo) Yoga
(Manavayanakayasambhudo) happens through the actions of mind, speech, and body.
(Bandho) Their bondage (Bhavanimitto) happens due to the cause of emotions.
(Bhavo) That emotion (Radiraagadosamohjudo) is tainted with attachment, passion,
aversion, and delusion.  **Specific Meaning:** Yoga is the movement of the soul,
characterized by the action of mind, speech, and body, which is different from
the pure, unchanging, luminous consciousness. It is the cause of taking karma,
which is destroyed by the destruction and pacification of the karma of the past.
The emotion that arises from the delusion of perception and the delusion of
conduct, which is different from the light of pure consciousness, is the emotion
that is tainted with attachment, passion, aversion, and delusion. Here, the word
"rati" should be taken as the desire for pleasure, which is inseparable from
humor, and the desire for women, men, and eunuchs, and the desire for the
knowledge of the Vedas. The word "rag" should be taken as the desire for
illusion and greed. The word "dvesha" should be taken as the six types of
aversion, which are anger, pride, aversion, sorrow, fear, and disgust. The word
"moha" should be taken as the delusion of perception or false perception. These
emotions cause the bondage of the state and the bondage of the parts. Here, the
external cause of bondage is yoga, because it is the cause of the taking of
karma, which leads to the bondage of nature and the bondage of the parts. The
internal cause is the emotion of kshaya, because it is the cause of the state
and the parts of karma, which causes the karma pudgalas to remain with the soul
for a long time. || 148 ||  This also indicates the external cause of the
bondage of the substances like false perception, etc.  **Heeduchatu-viyappo
Atthaviy-ppass karanam bhanidam. Tesim pi ya raagadi tesi-mahave na bajjhati. ||
149 ||**  **Hetuscha turvikalpo'shtavikalpasya karanam bhanitam. Tesham api cha
raagaadayasteshamahave na badhyante. || 149 ||**  In other texts, the four-fold
cause of karma, which is the cause of bondage, is said to be the substance
cause, which is the four-fold cause of false perception, non-restraint, kshaya,
and yoga. Even these, the emotions of the soul, like passion, etc., are the
causes of bondage, because even if the emotions of passion, etc., are not
present, the soul is not bound even if the substances of false perception, non-
restraint, kshaya, and yoga are present. Therefore, it is certain that passion,
etc., are the causes of bondage because they are the waves. || 149 ||  Thus ends
the explanation of the meaning of bondage.

356 Description of the Nine Substances and the Path to Liberation, with Anvaya
(Fourfold Cause: Cause) (False Belief, etc.) Four types of causes (Cause of the
Eightfold Karma) have been described as the cause of eight types of karma. [Even
these] also (Passion, etc.) (In the Jiva) have passion, etc., as their cause.
(Absence of these) In the absence of passion, etc., (They are not bound) the
Jiva is not bound. Commentary: This is a clarification of the fact that false
belief, etc., (False belief, etc., are the categories of substance) are also (In
binding) external causes. In other scriptures (In other scriptures), false
belief, non-restraint, passions, and yoga have been described as the four types
of substance-causes (Substance-conditions) that are the cause of the eight types
of karma and are the cause of binding. Even these have passion, etc., as the
cause of their being the cause of binding, because in the absence of passion,
etc., the Jiva is not bound even in the presence of false belief, non-restraint,
passions, and yoga in the substance. Therefore, it is certain that passion,
etc., are the internal cause of binding, and thus they are the cause of binding.
||149|| Thus ends the explanation of the substance of binding. Sa. Ta. - Now, it
is not only yoga that is the external cause of binding, but also false belief,
etc., and the categories of substance, etc., are also external causes in
relation to the cause of passion, etc. He. Hi. - He. Tu. Ka. Ra. Na. Hi. Sp. Hu.

The eight types of karma (causes of bondage) are mentioned in the Pancastikaya
Prabhrit 357 (Atthaviyappassa). These eight types of karma are the causes of
bondage (bandhake karanam). They are also the causes of the karmic substances
(dravya karma) like mithyatva (falsehood), etc. (tesipi ya). These karmic
substances are caused by passions like raga (attachment), etc. (tesim). When
these passions are absent (abhave), the soul (jiva) does not get bound (na
vajanati).  **Special Meaning:**  The four types of karmic substances that arise
from mithyatva (falsehood), aviriti (non-restraint), kshaya (passions), and yoga
(attachment) are mentioned as the causes of bondage for the eight new types of
karmic substances. These karmic substances are those that cover the true nature
of the soul (parmatma) which is free from passions and possesses the eight
qualities like samyaktva (right faith), etc. The cause of these karmic
substances is the passions like raga (attachment), etc., which are different
from the pure soul (atma dravya) that is free from passions. This is because
even if the passions related to the soul are absent, the soul does not get bound
if the four karmic substances or causes are present. This is because the soul
that is free from attachment to desirable and undesirable objects does not get
bound. If the soul gets bound simply by the arising of these karmic substances,
even without the passions, then the soul would always be bound because the
karmic substances are always arising in worldly souls. Therefore, it is known
that the new karmic substances are the causes of the arising of the karmic
substances. The cause of these karmic substances is the passions of the soul.
Therefore, it is proven that not only yoga (attachment) is the external cause of
bondage, but the karmic substances are also the external causes of bondage.
Thus, the ninth chapter of the second Mahaadhikaran (great chapter) which deals
with the nine substances, is completed with the explanation of bondage in three
verses.  **Now, the explanation of the substance of liberation:**  This is the
explanation of the nature of liberation, which is the liberation from the karmic
substances, the cause of liberation, and the ultimate restraint.  **Verse 150:**
> **Hetvabhave niyamajjayate jnaninah asravanirodhah. Astravabhavena vina jayate
karmanastu nirodhah.**  > **When the cause is absent, the restraint of the
asravas (karmic currents) arises for the knower. Without the asravas, the
restraint of karma arises.**  **Verse 151:**  > **Kammasabhavena ya savvahu
savva-loga-darisi ya. Pavati indiya-rahidam avvabahm suh-mananta.**  > **When
the karmic substances are absent, the soul sees all beings. It becomes free from
the senses, free from bondage, and enjoys infinite bliss.**  This chapter
explains that the absence of the karmic substances is the cause of liberation.
The absence of the karmic substances leads to the restraint of the karmic
currents, which in turn leads to the restraint of karma. When karma is
restrained, the soul is liberated and enjoys infinite bliss.

##  Translation:  **358**  **Verse 151:**  By the absence of karma, the
omniscient, the seer of all worlds, attains endless, unobstructed, and sensory-
free bliss.  **Explanation:**  The cause of inflow (āsrava) is the feeling of
attachment, aversion, and delusion in the soul. The wise one is devoid of this
feeling. By the absence of this feeling, there is an absence of inflow. By the
absence of inflow, there is an absence of karma. By the absence of karma, there
is omniscience, the ability to see all worlds, unobstructed sensory activity,
and infinite bliss. This is the state of liberation of the soul, known as
jīvanmukti.  **How?**  The "feeling" referred to here is the activity of
knowledge, which is the continuous functioning of the soul covered by karma.
This feeling is impure for the worldly being due to the influence of the karmic
force of delusion, which has been accumulating since beginningless time.
However, this feeling is destroyed in the wise one by the cessation of
attachment, aversion, and delusion. Therefore, the inflow is stopped. By the
cessation of inflow, the karmic force of delusion is completely destroyed. The
infinite, pure, and beginningless energy of the soul, which is free from all
modifications, then manifests as the activity of knowledge. This activity
transcends the limitations of time and space, and by the destruction of the
veils of knowledge and vision, the wise one attains the state of perfect
knowledge. Due to the absence of the continuous functioning of knowledge, the
karmic force is destroyed. By the absence of karma, the wise one becomes
omniscient, the seer of all worlds, free from sensory activity, unobstructed,
and eternally blissful.  This is the type of liberation of the soul, which is
the cause of the liberation of the substance, and the highest form of restraint.
**Verse 150-151:**  Now, the explanation of the concept of liberation.
**Meaning:**  By the absence of the cause (attachment, aversion, and delusion),
the wise one naturally experiences the cessation of inflow. By the absence of
inflow, there is the cessation of karma. By the absence of karma, the wise one
becomes omniscient, the seer of all worlds, sensory-free, unobstructed, and
attains infinite bliss.  **Commentary:**  This explains the nature of liberation
of the soul, which is the highest form of restraint, the cause of the liberation
of the substance.  The cause of inflow is indeed the feeling of attachment,
aversion, and delusion in the soul. The wise one is devoid of this feeling. By
the absence of this feeling, there is an absence of inflow. By the absence of
inflow, there is an absence of karma. By the absence of karma, there is
omniscience, the ability to see all worlds, unobstructed sensory activity, and
infinite bliss. This is the state of liberation of the soul, known as
jīvanmukti.  "How?" If this question is asked, the explanation is as follows:
The "feeling" referred to here is the activity of knowledge, which is the
continuous functioning of the soul covered by karma. This feeling is impure for
the worldly being due to the influence of the karmic force of delusion, which
has been accumulating since beginningless time. However, this feeling is
destroyed in the wise one by the cessation of attachment, aversion, and
delusion. Therefore, the inflow is stopped. By the cessation of inflow, the
karmic force of delusion is completely destroyed. The infinite, pure, and
beginningless energy of the soul, which is free from all modifications, then
manifests as the activity of knowledge. This activity transcends the limitations
of time and space, and by the destruction of the veils of knowledge and vision,
the wise one attains the state of perfect knowledge. Due to the absence of the
continuous functioning of knowledge, the karmic force is destroyed. By the
absence of karma, the wise one becomes omniscient, the seer of all worlds, free
from sensory activity, unobstructed, and eternally blissful.

The 351 **Jivas** who have attained **Asrava** cessation are said to have
attained **Nirvikarata** (freedom from modifications) due to the destruction of
**Moha** (delusion). Then, the **Jivan** who has attained infinite **Chaitanya**
(consciousness) and **Veerya** (power) from the beginningless time, attains
**Kutastha Jnana** (absolute knowledge) by the destruction of **Jnana Avarana**
(knowledge veil), **Darsana Avarana** (perception veil) and **Antaray**
(obstacles) simultaneously, through the **Shuddha Jnapti Kriya** (pure
perception action) in the **Ksheena Moha Gunasthan** (stage of subtle delusion).
This happens because the **Jivan** transcends the **Karma** (action) due to the
absence of **Kramapravritti** (sequential activity) in the form of **Jnapti
Kriya**. Therefore, due to the absence of **Karma**, the **Jivan** becomes truly
**Sarvajña** (omniscient), **Sarvadarshi** (all-seeing) and **Indriya Vyapara
Ateeta** (transcending sensory activities), **Avyabhadha** (unobstructed) and
**Ananta Sukhavala** (possessing infinite bliss) forever.  This is the nature of
**Bhavakarma Moksha** (liberation from the karmic effects of emotions) and the
cause of **Dravyakarma Moksha** (liberation from the karmic effects of matter) -
**Param Sanvara** (ultimate restraint).

The text describes the path to liberation (moksha) through the Jain perspective.
It explains that after experiencing the first white meditation (Shukla Dhyana)
which illuminates the path of liberation, the individual overcomes the
defilements of attachment (raga) and aversion (dvesha) through the practice of
right conduct (charitra). This leads to the destruction of the veil of ignorance
(moha) and the attainment of a state of pure, unblemished self-awareness
(nirvikar shuddhatma anubhuti). This state, characterized by the absence of
attachment (vitaraag charitra), marks the end of ignorance (moha kshapan).
After the destruction of ignorance, the individual remains in the state of
diminished karmic tendencies (kshinakshaya guna sthana) for a brief period.
Then, through the second white meditation (dvitiya shukla dhyana), the three
karmas that obstruct knowledge and vision (jnana darshan avarana antaray karma)
are eradicated simultaneously. This leads to the attainment of liberation
(bhavamokhsa), characterized by the infinite fourfold nature of perfect
knowledge (kevaljnana) and other qualities.  The text further explains that the
attainment of liberation (bhavamokhsa) is synonymous with the attainment of
perfect knowledge (kevaljnana), the state of being liberated while still alive
(jivanmukta), and the state of an Arhat (a fully liberated being).

The soul, which is of the nature of knowledge, etc., and is the essence of the
five astikayas, attains the state of Dharma-dhyana, which is the essence of the
soul. In the Agamas, it is said that the soul, by taking the path of the four
Gunasthanas, starting from the state of Asanyata Samyagdristi, etc., destroys
the Darshan-moha in any of the Gunasthanas and becomes Kshayika Samyagdristi.
Then, in the Muni state, the soul ascends to the Gunasthanas of A-purvakarana,
etc., and experiences the first Shukla-dhyana, which is the pure, luminous, and
discerning knowledge that the soul is distinct from all karmas, their natures,
etc. Then, due to the absence of the arising of raga, dvesha, charitra, and
moha, the soul attains the state of Dhi-traga-charitra, which is the experience
of the pure, unchanging soul and is capable of destroying charitra-moha. Through
this Vitraga-charitra, the soul destroys moha-karma. After the destruction of
moha, the soul dwells in the twelfth Gunasthan, called Kshina-kashaya, for a
moment and contemplates the second Shukla-dhyana. Through this dhyana, the soul
destroys the three karmas of Jnana-avaran, Darshan-avaran, and Antaraya at the
end of this Gunasthan, completely and permanently, and attains liberation, which
is the state of infinite knowledge, etc., the essence of the four infinite
qualities. This is the essence. || 150 - 151 ||  Thus, two verses have been
spoken about the nature of liberation. This is the explanation of the dhyana,
which is the cause of the destruction of the karmas and the liberation of the
soul.   Darshan-nana-samaggam jhanam no anna-davy-sanjuttam. Jayadi nijjar-hedu
sabhav-sahidasa sadhussa. || 152 ||  Darshan-jnana-samagram dhyanam no anya-
dravya-sanjuktam. Jayate nirjara-hetuh svabhava-sahitasya sadhoh. || 152 ||
Thus, for the liberated Bhagavan Kevali, who is satisfied with his own nature,
whose actions are exhausted due to the destruction of the karmas, whose
coverings are destroyed, whose knowledge and vision are infinite, whose
consciousness is pure, who is beyond the senses, who is free from association
with other substances, whose nature is unchanging and luminous, and whose
essence is not worthy of being called dhyana, how can his essence be described
as the cause of destruction, seeing the fall of his accumulated karmas, their
power, and their destruction? || 152 ||  Anvaya-artha: (Svabhava-sahitasya
sadhoh) The liberated Bhagavan Kevali, who is endowed with his own nature,
(darshan-jnana-samagram) whose knowledge and vision are complete, and (no anya-
dravya-sanjuktam) who is not associated with any other substance, (dhyanam) his
dhyana (nirjara-hetuh jayate) is the cause of destruction.  Tika: This is the
explanation of the dhyana, which is the cause of the ultimate destruction of the
karmas and the liberation of the soul. Thus, in reality, this liberated Bhagavan
Kevali, who has attained liberation, whose actions are exhausted due to the
destruction of the karmas, whose coverings are destroyed, whose knowledge and
vision are infinite, whose consciousness is pure, who is beyond the senses, who
is free from association with other substances, whose nature is unchanging and
luminous, and whose essence is not worthy of being called dhyana, how can his
essence be described as the cause of destruction, seeing the fall of his
accumulated karmas, their power, and their destruction? || 152 ||

## 362  The nature of the soul (the soul's own state), which is worthy of being
called 'Dhyana' (meditation) because it is devoid of association with other
substances due to the shedding of the covering of the nine substances and the
path to liberation, due to the infinite knowledge and perception, due to the
complete pure knowledge consciousness, and due to the transcendental nature, is
described as the cause of the exhaustion (diminution) of the power of the karmas
accumulated in the past or their fall (destruction), as the cause of exhaustion.
||152||  **Commentary:**  Here, the text explains the nature of Dhyana
(meditation) as the cause of the exhaustion of all substances, which is the
destruction of the four types of karmas that are the cause of the remaining
sensations, etc.  The explanation is given in the form of refutation of the
words "Dansa" etc. By "Dansa" and "Nana" (knowledge) and "Darsana" (perception),
what is meant is complete (perfect) Dhyana (meditation). Again, what is the
specific nature of this Dhyana? It is not associated with any other substance.
Such Dhyana is the cause of exhaustion. Of whom? Of the soul, which is
associated with its own pure nature.  Indeed, the liberated Kevali (omniscient
being), having attained the state described earlier, is free from all
modifications and is characterized by supreme bliss, and is satisfied with the
happiness arising from his own nature. Due to the destruction of the covering of
knowledge and perception, he has inherent pure knowledge and perception, and due
to the transformation of his consciousness into pure consciousness, he is free
from the activities of the senses and the dependence on external substances.
Therefore, his nature is devoid of association with other substances, and is
characterized by unwavering consciousness. Seeing the destruction of the state
and the melting away of the karmas accumulated in the past, which are the cause
of Dhyana, this nature of the soul is called Dhyana, in a metaphorical sense.
**Objection:**  The disciple asks, "This Dhyana, which is devoid of dependence
on other substances, may be for the Kevalis (omniscient beings). Why? Because it
is said that Dhyana is metaphorical for the Kevalis. In the texts like "Charitra
Sara", it is said that "those who are in the state of hypocrisy, meditate on the
substance atom or the state atom, and produce Kevala Jnana (omniscient
knowledge)". How can this be devoid of dependence on other substances?"
**Resolution:**  The text says that the word "substance atom" refers to the
subtle nature of the substance, and the word "state atom" refers to the subtle
nature of the state. It is not the pudgala atom. This explanation is given in
the "Sarvartha Siddhi" commentary.  The explanation of this dialogue is as
follows: The word "substance" refers to the soul substance. Its atom is the
state that is free from attachment and aversion. What is the meaning of "atom"?
It is the subtle state. How is it subtle? It is subtle because it is beyond the
reach of the state of samadhi without discrimination. This is the explanation of
the word "substance atom".  The word "state" refers to the state of self-
awareness and knowledge of the soul substance. Its atom is the state that is
free from attachment, aversion, etc. What is the meaning of "atom"? It is the
subtle state that is free from attachment, aversion, etc. How is it subtle? It
is subtle because it is beyond the reach of the senses and the mind. This is the
explanation of the word "state atom".  The meaning here is that for the initial
stabilization of the mind, and for the purpose of deceiving the mind with the
desire for objects, the liberated beings, the five supreme beings, etc., are to
be meditated upon. When the mind becomes stable through intense meditation, then
one should meditate on one's own pure soul nature.  Thus, it is said by Sri
Pujyapada Swami in the explanation of "Nischya Dhyeya" (object of meditation):
"The soul, being the doer, meditates on the soul, which is the object of action,
with the soul as the instrument, and thus becomes omniscient."  The explanation
of this is as follows: The soul, being the doer, meditates on the soul, which is
the object of action, with the soul as the instrument, and thus becomes
omniscient.  Therefore, knowing the relationship between the means and the end,
and the relationship between the object of meditation and the meditator, there
should be no dispute about the object of meditation. ||152||

The nature of the meditation that is the cause of the destruction of the
remaining karmas, which are the cause of the exhaustion of all substances, is
described as follows:  **General Meaning (with explanation):** The meditation
that arises in the virtuous (sadhu) who possesses pure nature (shuddha svabhava)
is the cause of exhaustion (nijjarhedu). This meditation (jhanam) is filled with
(dasananaan samgam) perception and knowledge and is not (annadavvasanjuttam no)
combined with other substances.  **Specific Meaning:** The Kevali Bhagwan, whose
state of liberation through detachment (bhavamokharupa) was described in the
previous verse, is free from the afflictions of worldly pleasure and pain
(harsha vishadarupa sansarik sukha tatha duhkha ke vikaron se mukt hain). They
are endowed with perfect knowledge (kevalgyan) and perfect perception
(kevaldarshan) due to the destruction of the veils that obstruct them. They are
free from the association of other substances (paradravy ke sangyog rahit hain)
because they are merged in their innate pure consciousness (sahaj shuddha
chaitanyabhav mein parinaman karne se) and because they are not dependent on
external objects like the activities of the senses (indriyon ke vyapar adi
bahari dravyon ke alamban ke nahin rahene se). They are stable and possess the
nature of pure consciousness (sthira chaitanyasvabhav ke thari hain) because
they are unwavering in their own nature (apne svabhav mein nischal hone se).
This meditation is called the treatment (upchar) of the Kevali Bhagwan because
it is the cause of the exhaustion (nirjara) of the karmas accumulated in the
past, and the exhaustion is seen here.  Here, the disciple asks: Why is the
meditation of the Kevali Bhagwan described as being free from the dependence on
other substances? It is said that the meditation of the Kevali is called
treatment, but in texts like Charitrasar, it is said that the non-omniscient
ascetics (chhadmasth arthath asarvgy tapasvi) generate perfect knowledge by
meditating on the substance atoms (dravya paramanu) or the state atoms (bhav
paramanu). How can this meditation be free from the dependence on other
substances?  The Acharya answers: The term "substance atom" should be understood
as referring to the subtle nature of the substance, and the term "state atom"
should be understood as referring to the subtle nature of the state. It should
not be understood as referring to the pudgala atom. This explanation is given in
the commentary on Sarvarthasiddhi. The same explanation is given here. Here, the
term "substance" should be understood as referring to the self-substance (atma-
dravya), and the term "atom" refers to the subtle state free from the
attachments of attachment, aversion, etc. The subtle nature of the self-
substance is called the "substance atom." This subtle state is taken here
because it is the object of the state of complete absorption (nirvikalpa
samadhi). This is the explanation of the term "substance atom." The term "state"
should be understood as referring to the self-awareness (svasanvedan) knowledge-
result of the same self-substance. The atom of this state, i.e., the subtle
result free from the alternatives of attachment, etc., is the "state atom." This
subtlety is taken here because it is the object of the state of complete
absorption (nirvikalpa samadhi).

## 364 The description of the nine substances and the path to liberation is not
the subject of the senses and mind. It is worthy to know the contemplation of
the atom as a feeling. Here, the feeling is that for the first stage disciples,
in order to stabilize their mind and to avoid the attention of the form of
desire for objects, the tradition is worthy of contemplating the five supreme
beings, etc., but when the mind becomes stable through the practice of stronger
contemplation, then one's pure self-nature is worthy of contemplation.
Similarly, Sri Pujyapada Swami has explained the meaning of the object of
contemplation: "Ātmānāmātma ātmānyevātmānāsau kṣaṇamupjanayan san svayambhūḥ
pravṛttaḥ." The explanation of this sutra is: The soul that perceives its own
soul in its own soul, by its own soul, even for a moment - that is, even for a
single inner moment - becomes omniscient. In this way, knowing the meaning of
the object and the means, which are mutually dependent, and the practical and
theoretical perspectives, it is not worthy to argue about the object. || 152 ||
This is the explanation of the nature of liberation of substance. The one who is
endowed with restraint, who destroys all actions, who is free from the karmas of
vedaniya and ayus, is liberated from existence by that, that is liberation. ||
153 || Now, when the liberated one, the Kevalin, has attained liberation of
feeling, the restraint of the supreme restraint, which is well-known, is
established in the continuity of the subsequent karmas, and the contemplation of
the supreme destruction, which is the cause of destruction, is well-known, then
in the continuity of the previous karmas, sometimes by nature itself, sometimes
by the method of destruction, the ayus karma becomes equal to the lifespan, and
the ayus karma is destroyed according to its own nature, and at the time of
giving up that existence, the complete separation of the karmas of vedaniya,
ayus, name, and lineage from the soul; the liberation of substance of the karma
particles. || 153 || Thus ends the explanation of the substance of liberation.
|| Thus ends the explanation of the nine substances, which are the subject of
right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, which are the components of the
path to liberation. || Meaning of the verse: (The one who is endowed with
restraint) The soul who is endowed with restraint (having attained perfect
knowledge) (destroys all actions) destroys all karmas, (being free from the
karmas of vedaniya and ayus) being free from the karmas of vedaniya and ayus,
(is liberated from existence) is liberated from existence (by that) by that,
(that is liberation) that is liberation.

365 This is a statement of the nature of dravya moksha. In reality, when the
Kevali Bhagwan attains bhava moksha, due to the attainment of param samvara
siddhi, he obtains the destruction of the future karma-santati, and due to the
attainment of dhyana siddhi, which is the cause of param nirjara, the previous
karma-santati, whose state is perhaps naturally as much as that of ayu karma,
and perhaps as much as that of ayu karma due to samudghata vidhan, is destroyed
according to ayu karma, and the separation of the vedaniya-ayu-nama-gotra karma
pudgals from the jiva at the time of leaving the bhava for apunarbhava (siddha-
gati) is dravya moksha. ||153|| Thus, the explanation of moksha-padartha is
complete, and the explanation of the nine padarthas, which are the subject
matter of samyag darshan and samyag gyan, which are the components of moksha-
marg, is also complete! Santa - Now, dravya moksha, which is the name for all
moksha, is being explained, which is - who is the doer, who is united with
samvara - united with param samvara. What is he doing? He is destroying - he is
destroying! What? All karmas - all karmas. Again, what is special about him? He
is free from vedaniya-ayushya karma, which is known as vyapgatavedaniyaayushya
karma. Such a person, what does he do? He abandons bhava - he abandons bhava,
due to which he abandons the karma known as nama-gotra, which is the meaning of
the word bhava. Due to that cause, he is known as moksha. Or, that person is
moksha without any difference. That is the meaning. For example, when the Kevali
attains bhava moksha, he performs sakala samvara, which is achieved by nirvikar
samvitti, and experiences sakala nirjara of the long-accumulated karmas, which
is achieved by the pure atma dhyana mentioned earlier, and when there is a
remaining life of less than a muhurta, he performs kevali samudghata, which is
the name for the complete destruction of the world, which is the destruction of
the three karmas, vedaniya, nama, and gotra, which are more than the ayu, for
the purpose of destroying the existence of the world, or for the purpose of
destroying the existence of the world, or he does not perform it again when the
ayu-sahakarma has the same duration of existence in the world. After that, he
performs the third shukla dhyana, which is known as upvarana, which is the
subtle action-perception, which is the form of his pure atma, which is steady in
its nature. After that, he crosses the yogi-guna-sthana, and attains the fourth
shukla dhyana, which is known as param yatha-khyata charitra, which is the
attainment of the supreme samarasibhava, which is the characteristic of sukha-
amrita-rasa-asvada-trpti, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-

The second major chapter, comprising fifty verses in ten sub-sections,
concludes. It expounds on the nine substances, including the soul, which are the
subject matter of perception and knowledge, the components of conduct and the
path to liberation.  **Hindi Translation:**  The liberation of the substance is
the same as complete liberation, as they say.   **General Meaning with Anvaya:**
(The one) who is endowed with complete restraint (sanvarena jutto), (and) who is
(adha) also (savvakammani) destroying all karmas (nijjaramano), (and) who is
destroying vedaniya karma and ayu karma (vadagavedausso), (and) who abandons
(muyadi) the world (bhavam) created by name and gotra karma, (tena) due to this
(so) that very soul (mokkho) becomes liberation, or, according to the principle
of non-difference, that very person is liberation.  **Specific Meaning:**  When
the Kevali Bhagavan, residing in the thirteenth guna-sthana, attains liberation
of the essence, he performs complete restraint, which is attainable through the
experience of the pure self, free from modifications, and experiences the
complete destruction of accumulated karmas, which is attainable through the pure
self-meditation, as mentioned earlier. When only a few moments remain in his
life, if the state of vedaniya, name, and gotra karmas is greater than the state
of ayu karma, then, to destroy the greater state of these three karmas and to
destroy the state of the world, he performs the Kevali-samudghata in four forms:
danda, kapat, pratar, and lokapurna. Or, if the state of these three karmas is
equal to the state of ayu karma, then he does not perform the Kevali-samudghata,
but instead, he performs the third white meditation, called "sukshmakriya-
pratipati," which is a subtle action in the form of steady conduct in his pure
self. Then, he transcends the sa-yogi guna-sthana and enters the a-yogi guna-
sthana. Here, he experiences the bliss of the pure self in all realms,
transforming into a single form of bliss, and, being satisfied with the taste of
the nectar of supreme harmony, he attains the fourth white meditation, called
"samuchchhinna-kriya," which is the supreme character, a repository of all
virtues and conduct. Then, in the last two moments of this guna-sthana, in the
first moment, the seventy-two natures, including the body, and in the last
moment, the thirteen natures of the four karmas: vedaniya, ayu, name, and gotra,
are completely separated from the soul. This is called liberation of the
substance. After being separated from all karmas, the liberated soul resides in
the front part of the universe for a moment. After being liberated from the
body, the movement of the liberated soul is like a potter's wheel that has been
turned, due to its previous use.

## Pancastikaya Prabhrut 367  Like a gourd freed from its clinging vines, like a
castor seed freed from its bondage, and like the flame of a fire ascending
upwards by its own nature, they ascend upwards. They do not go to the Lokagra,
the realm of the gods, because they lack the Dharmaastikaya, the cause of going.
They remain in the Lokagra, enjoying the objects of the senses, the eternal,
imperishable, supreme bliss, for an infinite time. || 153 ||  Thus, the nature
of Dravya Moksha has been explained in two sutras. With the emphasis on Bhava
Moksha and Dravya Moksha, the tenth Antar Adhikar has been completed in four
gathas through two locations.  In this Tatparya Vritti, the first four gathas,
starting with the gatha "Abhibandiun Siraasa," are primarily about the path of
Vyavahar Moksha. Then, sixteen gathas explain the nature of the Jiva substance.
Next, four gathas describe the Ajiva substance. Then, three gathas provide an
introduction to the seven substances like punya, papa, etc. Following that, four
gathas are dedicated to describing the two substances of punya and papa, and six
gathas explain the nature of Shubha and Ashubha Asrava. After that, three sutras
explain the nature of the Samvara substance, followed by three gathas explaining
the Nirjara substance. Then, three sutras describe the Bandha substance, and
finally, four sutras explain the Moksha substance. In this way, the ten Antar
Adhikars, encompassing fifty gathas, describe the limbs of the path of Moksha,
as well as the nine substances like Jiva, which are the subject matter of
Darshan and Gyan. Thus, the second Maha Adhikar, which presents this
explanation, is complete.  ## Ath Mokshamarg Prapancha Suchika Chulika  This is
the explanation of the nature of the path of Moksha.  Jiva - the sixth gana,
unhindered vision, non-dual nature. Their conduct is established, their
existence is blameless, it is said. || 154 ||  Jiva's nature is knowledge,
unhindered vision, non-dual nature. Their conduct is established, their
existence is blameless, it is said. || 154 ||  The path of Moksha is the conduct
established by the nature of the Jiva. The nature of the Jiva is knowledge and
vision, which are non-dual in nature, because they are the essence of the Jiva,
which is characterized by special and general consciousness. Now, the existence
of knowledge and vision, which are the essence of the Jiva, is not subject to
change, decay, or destruction, and is free from the influence of attachment,
aversion, etc. This is their conduct, and this is the path of Moksha. There are
two types of conduct in the world: one's own conduct and the conduct of others.
One's own conduct is at one's own time, and the conduct of others is at their
time.

## 368 **Mokshamārga Prapancha Sūchika Chūlikā**  **Vityartha:** There, the
existence-form that is situated in its own nature is the self-conduct, and the
existence-form that is situated in another's nature is the other-conduct. That
which is situated in its own nature, the existence-form, is completely
unblameable due to its being different from the existence-form situated in
another's nature. This is to be understood here as the direct path to
liberation. || 154 ||  Now, this is the Chūlikā that indicates the expanse of
the path to liberation.  **Anvayārthī:** (Jīvasvabhāva) The nature of the soul
(apratihata jñānam) is unhindered knowledge and (darśanam) vision - (ananayamam)
which is (jīvase) non-dual to the soul. (Tayoḥ) In those knowledge and vision
(niyatam) there is a constant (astitvam) existence (aninditam) which is
unblameable (cāritram ca bhaṇitam) which (Jinendra) has called conduct.
**Tīkā:** This is the statement of the nature of the path to liberation.  The
conduct that is constantly present in the nature of the soul is the path to
liberation. The nature of the soul is truly knowledge and vision because they
are non-dual to the soul. The reason for knowledge and vision being non-dual to
the soul is that the soul is born from the nature of consciousness in both its
particular and general forms. Now, that which is constantly present in those
knowledge and vision, which are the nature of the soul, and which is unblameable
due to the absence of the existence that is the form of production and
destruction, and the absence of the results of attachment, etc., is conduct.
This is the path to liberation.  In worldly beings, conduct is truly of two
types: (1) self-conduct and (2) other-conduct. (1) self-time and (2) other-time,
this is the meaning. There, the existence-form situated in its own nature
(cāritram) is self-conduct, and the existence-form situated in another's nature
(cāritram) is other-conduct. Out of these (i.e., out of the two types of
conduct), the conduct that is the existence-form situated in its own nature -
which is completely unblameable due to being different from the existence-form
situated in another's nature - is to be understood here as the direct path to
liberation. || 154 ||  **Saṁ. Tā. TO:** From here onwards, in the third great
chapter in the form of a Chūlikā, there are twenty gāthās, which are primarily
about attaining liberation, and which explain in detail the conduct of
certainty, the path to liberation. In those twenty gāthās, the first sūtra,
"Jīvasahāo ṇāṇam," etc., is about the nature of the pure soul, which is
knowledge and vision, and about the conduct that is constant in the nature of
the soul being the path to liberation. Then, the second sūtra, "Jīvo
sahāvaṇiyado," etc., is about the self-time, which is based on the pure soul,
and the other-time, which is based on the results of false views, attachment,
etc. Then, the two gāthās, "Jo paradavvam hi," etc., are primarily about the
detailed explanation of the other-time, which is different from the self-time,
which is based on faith in the pure soul, etc. Then, the two gāthās, "Jo
savvasaṁga," etc., are primarily about the detailed explanation of the self-
time, which is the nature of self-awareness without the modifications of
attachment, etc. Then, the fifth sūtra, "Dhammādī saddhaṇaṁ," etc., is primarily
about the explanation of the conduct of the path to liberation, which is the
practice of the six substances, etc., as taught by the omniscient, free from
attachment, and the five great vows, etc., based on correct faith and knowledge.
Then, the three jewels of conduct are explained, and the nature of the three
jewels of certainty, which are the means to achieve them, are explained.

The two gathas, starting with "Nichchayane", expound the path to liberation,
beginning with the five astikayas. Following that, the sutra starting with "Jena
Vijana" emphasizes that whoever experiences the supreme joy of pure soul-
consciousness, beyond the senses, is the one who has transcended the illusion of
existence. Then, the sutra starting with "Dasanana Charittani" in the eighth
section, emphasizes that liberation and the bondage of karma are achieved
through the three jewels of knowledge, conduct, and faith, respectively.
Further, the five gathas starting with "Annanado Nani" explain that even though
one is capable of attaining the state of perfect samadhi, characterized by the
absence of duality, if one chooses to follow a path of attachment, then it is
considered gross liberation. However, if one strives for that state but due to
lack of resources, resorts to using good for bad purposes, then it is considered
subtle liberation.   Following that, the two sutras starting with "Sapadalda"
emphasize that even though one may not attain liberation immediately due to the
karmic consequences of their actions, the knowledge of the nine substances,
including Tirthankaras and other liberated souls, along with devotion, will
eventually lead to the accumulation of resources for pure and unblemished
liberation in the future.   The sutra starting with "Taha Nichudikamo" explains
that the ultimate goal of this entire doctrine, starting with the five
astikayas, is to achieve liberation, which is characterized by the absence of
attachment. Finally, the gatha-sutra starting with "Maggappabhavanatu" concludes
the doctrine, summarizing the essence of the teachings.   Thus, the third
Mahaadhikaran, with its twelve sections, provides a detailed explanation of
liberation and the path to liberation.   **Explanation:**  The text explains
that the first part of the gathas describes the nature of the soul, while the
second part describes the conduct that leads to liberation. Alternatively, it
can be interpreted that knowledge, faith, and conduct are the nature of the
soul. The text then elaborates on the characteristics of the soul, including its
inherent purity, its ability to perceive both general and specific aspects of
reality, and its freedom from the influence of the senses.   The text further
explains that the conduct that leads to liberation is characterized by the
absence of attachment, aversion, and delusion. This conduct is described as
being "unwavering" and "unblemished." The text emphasizes that this conduct is
the only cause of liberation and that all other causes are ultimately illusory.
The text concludes by urging the reader to constantly contemplate the nature of
the soul and the conduct that leads to liberation. It warns that those who are
attached to the illusory world will continue to suffer for an infinite amount of
time.

## 370 **Mokshamārga Prapancha Sūchika Chūlikā Kimpi** ||154||   Thus, by
stating the nature of the soul, and by stating the nature of the soul's conduct,
the path to liberation is explained. In the first instance, the verses are sung.
**Pīthikā** -  Further, the third great authority is on the special explanation
of the main causes of liberation, namely, the certainty and practice of the path
to liberation, in the form of a Chūlikā. It contains twenty verses beginning
with "Jīvasahāo ṇāṇam".  Among these twenty verses, the nature of pure soul, the
nature of pure knowledge, and the nature of pure vision are explained.  It is
said that the nature of the soul is stable conduct, and that is the path to
liberation.  Thus, in the first instance, the sūtra "Jīvasahāo ṇāṇam" etc. is
stated.  Then, the sūtra "Jīvasahāo ṇiyado" etc. is stated, saying that the pure
soul's own time is dependent on the pure soul, and the false time is dependent
on the false nature and the results of passion, etc.  Then, there are two verses
beginning with "Jo paradavvehi", etc., which mainly describe the special nature
of the pure soul's own time, which is different from the false time, which is
different from the pure soul's own time, which is in the form of support, etc.
Then, there are two verses beginning with "Jo savvasanga", etc., which mainly
explain the special nature of the pure soul's own time, which is in the form of
self-awareness, free from the alternatives of passion, etc.  Then, in the fifth
instance, there is one sūtra beginning with "Dhammādī saddahaṇam", etc., which
mainly describes the path to liberation, which is the practice of the six
substances, etc., as described by the omniscient, free from passion, in the form
of right faith, right knowledge, and the five great vows, etc.  Then, there are
two verses beginning with "Ničchayaṇayeṇa", etc., which describe the path to
liberation, which is the certainty of the three jewels of liberation, which are
to be achieved by the three jewels of practice.  Then, the sūtra "Jeṇa vijāṇa",
etc., is stated, which mainly explains that the feeling that only the
transcendental joy arising from the contemplation of the pure soul is worth
receiving is right vision.  Then, in the eighth instance, the sūtra
"Dansaṇṇāṇacarittāṇi", etc., is stated, which mainly explains that liberation is
achieved through the path of the three jewels of certainty, and the bondage of
merit is achieved through the path of the three jewels of practice.  Then, there
are five verses beginning with "Aṇṇāṇādō ṇāṇī", etc., which explain that one
who, even though capable of staying in the restraint called Samāyika, which is
the state of non-dualistic false absorption, abandons it and practices
passionate conduct in solitude, considers it to be the cause of liberation, is
called a gross false time.  And one who, desiring to stay in the restraint
called Samāyika, which is the state of absorption, but not having the necessary
materials, takes refuge in good use to avoid evil, is called a subtle false
time.  Then, there is the main explanation that, although the knowledge of the
Agamas, which describe the ancient ones like the Tirthankaras, and the nine
substances like the soul, etc., and devotion to it, do not lead to liberation
because of the result of merit-hearing in that time, yet liberation is achieved
by obtaining the materials for the result of pure use, free from attachment, in
due course, based on it.

There are two sutras, "Pancastikaya Prabhruta" and "Sampadatttham". The meaning
of this Pancastikaya Prabhruta Shastra is that the cause of liberation is
Vitaragta, which is the state of being free from attachments. This is stated in
the sutra "Nistutikapa". Then, to complete the Shastra, there is a gatha sutra
"Maggappabhavanatum". In this way, the third Mahaadhikari explains the path of
liberation through twelve points.  The Hindi translation of the gatha is: "The
first half of the gatha describes the nature of the soul, and the second half
describes the nature of the soul, which is the path of liberation through the
four virtues of character."  The general meaning of the gatha is: "The nature of
the soul is pure knowledge and pure vision. These two are not different from the
soul. The state of being steadfast in these two pure knowledge and vision is
called Vitaragta, which is free from attachments and is called character. This
character is the path of liberation."  The specific meaning of the gatha is:
"Just as pure knowledge and pure vision are the nature of the soul, so too is
the character of Vitaragta, which is the state of being steadfast in one's own
nature. Pure knowledge is the ability to know all things in their infinite
nature, and pure vision is the ability to perceive the general nature of all
things. These two are the nature of the soul. Although these two knowledge and
vision are different from the soul in terms of name, form, and purpose, they are
not different from the soul in terms of substance, space, time, and state.
Similarly, the character that is described above is not different from the
nature of the soul. It is the state of being free from attachments, and it is
the state of being steadfast in one's own nature. This character is of two
types: one is called Paracharita, and the other is called Swacharita.
Paracharita is the state of remembering the pleasant objects of enjoyment that
one has experienced through others, and acting in a way that is contrary to
one's own nature. Swacharita is the state of acting in accordance with one's own
nature. This is the true character, and it is the cause of liberation. There is
no other cause of liberation. We do not know this path of liberation, and
therefore we are caught in the endless cycle of birth and death, which is caused
by false vision and attachments."

The path to liberation, the index of the universe, the essence, has gone.
Knowing this, now it is only appropriate to contemplate the nature of the being,
the character that is steadfast and stable, which is the direct cause of
liberation. As it is said,  "In the same way, those who are enamored with the
worldly causes, their time has passed endlessly, because they have not known
anything about the means of the causes of liberation." ||154||  Thus, by saying
that the nature of the being is the path to liberation, the first stanza has
been spoken.  "The being, by nature, is steadfast, but with fluctuating
qualities, and is then the other time. If it does its own time, it will be freed
from the bondage of karma." ||155||  The being of the world, because it is in
the state of knowledge and perception, even though it is steadfast by nature, is
still tainted by the pursuit of the arising of the primordial delusion, and
because of the impure use, it is diverse in its nature, and its fluctuating
qualities are the other time, the other character. And the same, by abandoning
the pursuit of the arising of the primordial delusion, because of the pure use,
it is unified in its nature, and its steadfast qualities are the own time, the
own character. Now, if, in any way, the being, illuminated by the light of right
knowledge, abandons the other time and takes up the own time, then it will
surely be freed from the bondage of karma. For the character of the being, by
nature, is the path to liberation. ||155||  Meaning of the verse: (The being)
being, (steadfast by nature) (in terms of substance) even though it is steadfast
by nature, (with fluctuating qualities, and then the other time) if it has
fluctuating qualities, then it is the other time. (If) if it (does its own time)
(by becoming transformed with steadfast qualities) does its own time, then (from
the bondage of karma) it is freed from the bondage of karma.  Commentary: Here
(in this stanza) the steadfast character in the nature of the being is shown to
be the path to liberation by the destruction of karma through the acceptance of
the own time and the abandonment of the other time. The worldly being, (in terms
of substance) because it is in the state of knowledge and perception, even
though it is steadfast by nature (-steadfastly situated), when it becomes
transformed by following the arising of the primordial delusion, because of the
impure use (-impure use), it takes on the diversity of its nature (-diversity of
its nature), and its fluctuating qualities are the other time, the other
character. There...

When the five-astīkāya (being) becomes extremely pure in its use, abandoning the
consequences that follow the arising of the beginningless obscuring, then its
fixed-quality-transformation, which is attained due to the oneness of the
essence, is its own time, that is, its own conduct.  Now, if, in reality, the
being, by manifesting the light of right knowledge, abandons its other time and
embraces its own time, then it is certainly freed from the bondage of karma.
Therefore, in reality, being fixed in the nature of the being, conduct, and the
path of liberation is the way.  **Commentary:**  It is said that because the
destruction of karma occurs by embracing one's own time, therefore, conduct that
is fixed in the nature of the being is the path of liberation. The being is
certainly fixed in its nature, but due to the influence of other factors, it
becomes involved in other-time, which is the transformation of non-fixed
qualities.  For example, the being, by its pure nature, is inherently pure in
knowledge and perception. However, in practice, due to the arising of
beginningless obscuring karma, which is opposed to the attainment of the pure
self free from obscurations, it undergoes transformation into the categories of
perception, knowledge, and other qualities, such as the categories of human,
hell, etc., and becomes attached to other-time and other conduct.  But when,
through the arising of the pure light of discrimination, it experiences the
supreme self, which is the characteristic of supreme knowledge, and contemplates
its own nature as pure and enlightened, then it becomes attached to its own time
and its own conduct.  If it does its own time, then it is freed from the bondage
of karma. Then, it is freed from the bondage, which is opposed to liberation,
which is the manifestation of infinite qualities, such as perfect knowledge.
Therefore, it is understood that conduct that is fixed in the nature of the
being, which is characterized by one's own time, is the path of liberation.
This verse indicates the difference between one's own time and other-time.

374 The path to liberation is a subtle and intricate process, involving a shift
from being engrossed in external objects (par-samaya) to recognizing the true
nature of the self (sva-samaya). When one, through the pure light of
discernment, experiences the self as the essence of the Supreme Being, they
begin to live in accordance with the true nature of their own self. By
understanding the nature of both the self and the external world, a being, free
from attachment, merges into the pure self-awareness of their own true nature
(sva-samaya). This liberation from bondage, which is the opposite of the
manifestation of infinite qualities like perfect knowledge, is achieved. Thus,
it is understood that the path to liberation lies in the unwavering conduct of
the self, characterized by self-awareness, which is the true nature of the soul.
||155||  This verse concludes the explanation of the distinction between the
self and the external world. This is a description of the nature of those who
are engaged in external activities. A being who, driven by attachment,
experiences pleasure or pain in external objects, is one who has abandoned their
own true nature and is engaged in external activities. ||156||  Whoever, due to
the influence of delusion and its consequences, engages in external objects,
experiencing pleasure or pain, is considered to have abandoned their own true
nature and is engaged in external activities. This is because the pure use of
one's own nature is considered one's own conduct, while the use of external
objects with attachment is considered external conduct. ||156||  Translation of
the verse: (He) who (with attachment) in external objects (experiences) pleasure
or pain (if he does), (that being) is one who has abandoned his own true nature
and is engaged in external activities.  Commentary: This is a statement about
the nature of those who engage in external activities.  A being who, due to the
influence of delusion and its consequences, engages in external objects,
experiencing pleasure or pain, is considered to have abandoned his own true
nature and is engaged in external activities. This is because the pure use of
one's own nature is considered one's own conduct, while the use of external
objects with attachment is considered external conduct. ||156||  _Commentary:
The text further clarifies the nature of those who are engrossed in external
objects. A being who, driven by attachment, experiences pleasure or pain in
external objects, is one who has abandoned their own true nature and is engaged
in external activities. _

## Translation:  **Pancastikaya Prabhrut**  **Verse 156:**  Thus, whoever,
having become corrupted from their own pure soul-substance, which is transformed
into pure qualities, becomes transformed by the passion of attachment, which is
contrary to the pure soul-principle, and performs actions that are characterized
by indifference towards auspicious and inauspicious external substances, thereby
becoming contrary to the pure utilization of external substances, and performs
actions that are either auspicious or inauspicious in all external substances,
that soul, being of the nature of knowledge and bliss, becomes corrupted from
its own conduct, which is characterized by following the principles, and becomes
a follower of the conduct of others, which is distinct from self-awareness and
practice. This is the meaning of the sutra.  **Verse 157:**  The Jinas declare
that whoever, by virtue of their own nature, has an influx of merit or demerit,
becomes a follower of the conduct of others.  **Explanation:**  Here, the state
of being imbued with auspiciousness is called the influx of merit, and the state
of being imbued with inauspiciousness is called the influx of demerit. Thus, it
is declared that whoever has an influx of merit or demerit, that is, whose soul
is in that state, becomes a follower of the conduct of others. Therefore, the
conduct of others is the path to bondage, not the path to liberation.

Bhāva - this is (by the Jinenḍras) declared. Therefore, the Pravṛtti in

Panchastikaya Prabhrita Two verses have been completed, describing the special
nature of the other-worldly path, which is different from the 366 experiential
forms and the definitive path to moksha.  The one who is free from all
attachments, with a mind focused solely on the self, knows and perceives his own
true nature with certainty. Such a jiva (living being) conducts himself in
accordance with his own pure conduct. (158)  The one who is truly free from all
attachments, with a mind focused solely on the self, knows and perceives his own
true nature, which is of the nature of knowledge and perception, with certainty
and stability. Such a jiva conducts himself in accordance with his own pure
conduct, for residing in the form of pure vision and knowledge is indeed one's
own true conduct.

## Mokshamarg Prapanch Suchi Ka Chulika 378  **By what means?**  **Sixthly:** By
the brilliance of the miraculous, unchanging consciousness. Therefore, the state
of being steadfast in the nature of the soul, characterized by pure knowledge
and perception, is the path to liberation. || 158 ||  **Hindi Ta:** - Uththānikā
- Further, the nature of the person who initiates the practice of self-conduct
is described in detail.  **General Meaning with Anvaya:** (He) who
(savvasangamukko) is free from all attachments, (naanamaano) with a focused
mind, (appaana) knows his own self (sahaveena) by nature (yida) steadfastly
(jaanadi) knows (passadi) sees (so) he (jeevo) the soul (sagchariya) his own
conduct (charadi) practices.  **Specific Meaning:** He who renounces all
external and internal attachments of the three realms and three times through
mind, speech, body, and action, causation, and approval, and is filled with the
beautiful joy arising from the feeling of the Supreme Self, is like a pitcher
filled with the nectar of supreme bliss, the taste of which is the ultimate
happiness. He is free from the web of choices arising from all external
influences due to the absence of desires for objects of enjoyment like the
feather of a pigeon, etc., which he has seen, heard, and experienced. He is one-
pointed in his mind and knows his own self as unchanging consciousness, shining
with miraculous brilliance, as the knower of self and others. He sees, i.e.,
experiences, the same self without any choices. Such a soul experiences his own
conduct, which is the experience of his pure self, and the language of the
supreme path, the spiritual character called Vitraag Param Samayik. This proves
that the steadfastness in the nature of the soul, characterized by pure
knowledge and perception, is the path to liberation. || 158 ||  **This is the
exposition of the path of pure self-conduct.**  **He practices his own conduct
who is free from the nature of other substances, who practices the perception,
knowledge, and choice of his own self without choice.** || 159 ||  **Charitam

beyond all the illusions and webs of delusion, free from the nature of other
substances, and constantly focusing on his own substance, practices the
perception, knowledge, and choice of his own self without choice, he indeed
practices his own conduct. For, relying on the certainty of the inseparable
nature of the means and the end, which is based on pure substance,

## The Exposition of the Path to Liberation (Moksha)  **Verse 379**  The
exposition of the path to liberation (Moksha) has been presented previously,
relying on the concept of "self-other" (svaparapratyayaparyaya) and the
distinction between means and ends (bhinnsadhyasadhanabhava), based on the
principle of conventional reality (vyavaharanaya). This is not contradictory, as
both the definitive (nishcaya) and conventional (vyavahara) realities have the
relationship of means and ends, like gold and gold-stone. Therefore, the path to
liberation (tirthapravartana) is governed by both principles.  **Commentary**
This verse describes the path of pure self-conduct (shuddh svaricharitra). The
yogi, free from all delusions (mohavyaha), devoid of the sense of self in
external objects (paradravya), and focused solely on the true self (svadravya),
practices the distinction of perception and knowledge (darshanajnanavikalpa) as
non-dual with the self (atman). This is true self-conduct.  Thus, the path to
liberation has been presented based on the definitive reality (nishcayanya),
relying on the non-dual nature of means and ends (abhinnsadhyasadhanabhava) of
pure substance (shuddhdravya). The previous exposition (in verse 107) was based
on the conventional reality (vyavaharanaya), relying on the concept of "self-
other" (svaparapratyayaparyaya) and the distinction between means and ends
(bhinnsadhyasadhanabhava). There is no contradiction here, as both the
definitive and conventional realities have the relationship of means and ends,
like gold and gold-stone. Therefore, the path to liberation (tirthapravartana)
is governed by both principles.  **Explanation**  This verse further clarifies
the concept of "self-time" (svayam) through a different approach. The phrase
"charati - charati" (he walks - he walks) signifies the act of self-conduct. The
question arises: what kind of conduct? The answer is "svakam charitam charati"
(he walks his own conduct). This refers to the individual who, free from
attachment (niruparaga), experiences constant bliss (sadananda), and lives a
life of self-realization (nijatmanucharanarupa). This individual remains
equanimous (samatabhavananukula) in the face of life and death, gain and loss,
pleasure and pain, praise and blame.  Who is this individual? It is the yogi who
is free from the sense of self in external objects (paradravya), devoid of all
mental constructs (vikalpajala) like desire for sensory objects
(panchendriyavishayabhilasha), egotism (mamatva), etc. This yogi does not
identify with external objects (bahirangaparadravya) and does not consider them
as part of the self (svabhava).  What does this yogi do? The verse states
"darshanajnanavikalpam avikalpam charati atmanah" (he practices the distinction
of perception and knowledge as non-dual with the self). This means that the
dualistic perception of "I know" and "I see" (ahm jnata, ahm drashta), which
arises in the state of duality (saviikalpa), becomes non-dual (nirvikalpa) in
the state of samadhi. In this state, the yogi experiences the infinite knowledge
and bliss (anantajnanananda) as non-dual with the self.  This verse, along with
the previous one, further elaborates on the concept of "self-time" (svayam) and
its non-dual nature (nirvikalpasvamsavedanasvarupa).

## The Path to Liberation: A Detailed Explanation  **Chapter 380**  The soul
(Atma) acts in accordance with its own nature (Avyam), which is one and the same
(Charadi). This is the same as acting in accordance with one's own character
(Sag Charivam, Charadi).  **Explanation:**  A yogi who is free from the desires
and attachments of the five senses, who is free from all the webs of delusion,
and who has abandoned the sense of "mine" in all external objects, the sense of
"I am the knower," "I am the seer," etc., and who experiences the infinite
knowledge, infinite bliss, and other qualities and inherent nature of the soul
by merging with it during the state of Nirvikalpa Samadhi, is a great soul. This
great soul is impartial towards life and death, gain and loss, pleasure and
pain, praise and blame, and is always joyful, nurturing the inner character of
the soul through the experience of the soul itself.  Thus, two verses are
completed, further explaining the special nature of the self-awareness in the
state of Nirvikalpa.  **The path to liberation is the practice of the means to
achieve liberation, as explained earlier.**  **Summary:**  Faith in Dharma,
etc., is Right Faith (Samyaktvam), knowledge based on the Angas is Knowledge
(Jnana), and effort in austerity is Conduct (Charya). This is the path to
liberation.  **Explanation:**  The path to liberation is Right Faith, Right
Knowledge, and Right Conduct. Faith in Dharma, etc., is based on the
understanding of the true nature of the objects of the world. Right Faith is the
state of being free from doubt about the true nature of things. Knowledge is the
understanding of the true nature of things, based on the Angas. Conduct is the
practice of austerity, as explained in the scriptures. This practice of
austerity is based on the understanding of the self and the other, and is a
means to achieve liberation.  The path to liberation is like a fire that is
kindled by the friction of a stone and a piece of wood. The fire is the inner
self, which is purified by the practice of austerity. The stone and the wood are
the means to achieve liberation. The fire is the state of liberation, which is
the ultimate goal.  Even though the pure soul, like the fire, is inherently
pure, it still needs the means to achieve liberation. This is because the soul
is not yet fully aware of its own true nature. The practice of austerity helps
the soul to become aware of its own true nature and to achieve liberation.
**Translation of the Sanskrit verse:**  Dharma, etc., faith is Right Faith,
knowledge based on the Angas is Knowledge, and effort in austerity is Conduct.
This is the path to liberation.

This is a description of the **Vyavahar Moksha Marg** (practical path to
liberation), which is a means to achieve the **Nischya Moksha Marg** (definitive
path to liberation), as mentioned in the 105th verse.  The path to liberation is
comprised of **Samyak Darshan** (right faith), **Samyak Jnana** (right
knowledge), and **Samyak Charitra** (right conduct).   **Samyak Darshan** is the
belief in the six substances and nine categories of existence, and the
understanding of the true nature of the **Tattva** (principles).   **Samyak
Jnana** is the knowledge of the eleven **Angas** (limbs) and fourteen **Purvas**
(precepts).  **Samyak Charitra** is the practice of the twelve **Tapas**
(austerities) and the various **Muni-Acharas** (conduct of the monks) as
described in the **Sutras** (texts).  This path to liberation, which is based on
the **Vyavahar Nay** (practical principle) and is pursued through the **Swar-
Pare-Hetuk Paryaya** (self and other-motivated principles), is like a burning
fire applied to a golden stone. It brings about a state of **Abhinna Vishranti**
(inseparable rest) in the **Antarang** (inner self) of the **Jiva** (soul), just
as a pure golden stone, though inherently pure, becomes even more refined
through the process of purification.  This **Vyavahar Moksha Marg** is a means
to achieve the **Nischya Moksha Marg**, even though the **Jiva**, like pure
gold, is inherently pure and does not require external means for purification.

## 382 The **Mokshamarg** (path to liberation) is a comprehensive guide, a
detailed explanation of the essence of **Vitarag** (free from attachment) and
**Sarvjna** (omniscient) teachings. It outlines the relationship between the
soul (Jiva) and other substances.  Both **Samyagdarshan** (right faith) and
**Samyagjnana** (right knowledge) are common to householders and monks. However,
the **charitra** (conduct) of the **sadhu** (saint) and **tapasvi** (ascetic) is
defined by the **charitra granthas** (texts on conduct) like **Aacharsar**
(essence of conduct). It involves the five **mahavrata** (great vows), five
**samiti** (observances), three **gupti** (secrecies), and six **aavashyak**
(essentials) – all in accordance with the seventh **gunasthan** (stage of
spiritual progress). The **charitra** of householders, as described in the
**Upasakaadhyayan Shastra** (text on householder's practice), is based on the
fifth **gunasthan** and includes **daan** (charity), **sheel** (good conduct),
**pooja** (worship), **upavas** (fasting), **darshan** (vision), **vrat** (vow),
and other practices, totaling eleven aspects. This is the essence of the
**Mokshamarg**.  This **Mokshamarg** is the foundation for the transformation of
oneself and others. It involves distinct means and ends, and its understanding
is based on **vyavharnay** (practical logic). Just as fire is an external means
to extract gold from ore, this **Mokshamarg** is an external means to achieve
**Nischyamokshamarg** (the definitive path to liberation). A **bhavy** (soul
destined for liberation) who, through **Nischyanyay** (definitive logic),
abandons the distinction between means and ends and focuses on the pure essence
of the soul, achieving **shraddha** (faith), **jnana** (knowledge), and
**anubhav** (experience) – this is the one who embraces **Nischyamokshamarg**.
For them too, this **Mokshamarg** is an external means. || 160 ||  Thus, the
**Nischyamokshamarg** is achieved through the **Vyavharmokshamarg**, completing
the fifth **sthala** (stage).  This is the explanation of **Nischyamokshamarg**
as the goal of **Vyavharmokshamarg**. The soul, united by the three principles
of **Nischyanyay**, is the one who does not engage in anything else and is free
from attachment – this is the **Mokshamarg**. || 161 ||  The soul, united by
**Samyagdarshan**, **Samyagjnana**, and **Charitra**, is the
**Nischyamokshamarg** due to its inherent nature of
**Jivasvabhavaniyatcharitra** (conduct governed by the nature of the soul). Now,
the one who has embraced **Vyavharmokshamarg** by abandoning **anadyavidya**
(original ignorance) – their **dharmaadittvatvarthashraddha** (faith in the
essence of Dharma), **angapurvagatarthajnana** (knowledge of the essence of
Dharma), and **tapascheshta** (effort in austerity) – all these are abandoned
and adopted for the sake of **dharmaadittvatvarthashraddha**,
**angapurvagatarthajnana**, and **tapascheshta**. This is the
**prarabdhaviviktabhavavyapar** (action of the soul in its state of separation
from the world). The **tyagopaadaan** (abandonment and adoption) of
**kutachidupaadey** (something to be taken) and **tyajyopaadaan** (something to
be abandoned) are again initiated by **pratividhanaabhipraay** (intention of the
soul). In this state, due to the **visishtabhavanaasousthavavashat** (power of
specific contemplation), the soul, united by **Samyagdarshan**, **Samyagjnana**,
and **Charitra**, becomes **samamangangi** (harmonious) and **parinatya**
(transformed). This leads to **tyagopaadaanvikalpashoonyatva** (absence of the
duality of abandonment and adoption) and **vishrantabhavavyapar** (action of the
soul in its state of rest). This is the **suniprakamp** (unwavering) state of
the soul. In this state, the soul, being **Jivasvabhavaniyatcharitra** (conduct
governed by the nature of the soul), is the **Nischyamokshamarg**.

The soul which is truly united by the three (right faith, right knowledge, and
right conduct), and does not do or abandon anything else, is called the path to
liberation (moksha marga) with certainty.   Therefore, the relationship between
the path to liberation in conduct (vyavahar moksha marga) and the path to
liberation in certainty (nishchay moksha marga) as means and end is very well
established.

384 The path to liberation is the ultimate experience of the supreme art, which
is the satisfaction of the taste of the nectar of death, arising from the pure
self. When the soul is transformed by the unwavering faith, vision, knowledge,
and conduct that are rooted in the pure self, then, by the principle of
certainty, because there is no difference between the goal and the means, the
soul itself becomes the path to liberation. Therefore, it is established that,
just as fire is to gold and stone, the path to liberation by certainty and the
path to liberation by conduct are capable of being the goal and the means. Hindi
Ta.-Uththānikā-Further, although in the previous discourse, during the time of
the previous discourse, the path to liberation by certainty was explained
through the two gāthās, "Jo savyasangamusko," etc., nevertheless, in order to
make it clear that this path to liberation by certainty is attainable through
the path to liberation by conduct, which was mentioned in the first gāthā, we
continue to teach. General meaning with Anvaya Go. A7) The soul (so) which,
having attained unity with (tehiṁ) those (tihi) three (kincivi aṇṇam) does not
do any other work (ṇ kuṇadi) (ṇ muydi) nor does it abandon anything,
(mokkhamanggōtti) is the path to liberation, so it is said (ṇiccayanaṇeṇ).
Specific meaning-The soul which, being absorbed in right faith, right knowledge,
and right conduct, does not engage in emotions like anger, etc., and does not
abandon the infinite knowledge, etc., which are rooted in the soul, is the
essence of the path to liberation by certainty. The taste for one's own pure
self is right faith, the knowledge of that is right knowledge, and the
unwavering experience of that pure self is right conduct. The unity of these
three is the path to liberation by certainty. The path to liberation by conduct
is its means, which, due to the destruction of the desire for ignorance that
arises from experience, is the essence of the three jewels. As this soul,
through the practice of the path to liberation by conduct, ascends the stages of
virtue, it becomes transformed into one form by experiencing the supreme art,
which is the satisfaction of the taste of the nectar of happiness, which is the
eternal bliss arising from the essence of its own pure self, and by being rooted
in the certain right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct that are rooted
in its own pure self. Then, by the principle of certainty, because there is no
difference between the goal and the means, the soul itself becomes the path to
liberation. From this, it is proven that, just as fire is to gold and stone, the
path to liberation by certainty and the path to liberation by conduct are
capable of being the goal and the means. 161. This is the indication of the
soul's conduct, knowledge, and faith. The one who walks (caradi) and does not
desire (ṇādi) anything other than himself (appaṇam) (appaṇā aṇṇam-mayam). That
conduct, knowledge, and faith (ṇāṇam dāsaṇ-midi) are established (ṇicchido
hodi). 162.

## The one who walks, knows, and sees the Self as non-dual with the Self
**Verse 162:** The one who walks, knows, and sees the Self as non-dual with the
Self, through the Self, is indeed established as Conduct, Knowledge, and Vision.
**Commentary:** This verse reveals the nature of the Self as Conduct, Knowledge,
and Vision.  The one who walks, knows, and sees the Self as non-dual with the
Self, through the Self, is indeed established as Conduct, Knowledge, and Vision.
This means that the Self, being non-dual, is the very essence of Conduct,
Knowledge, and Vision. The Self, being the doer, the action, and the instrument,
is established as one and the same. Therefore, the Self, being the essence of
Conduct, Knowledge, and Vision, is the path to liberation, which is
characterized by the conduct of the Self, as determined by the nature of the
Self.  **Anvaya:** The one (y:h) who (aatmaa) walks (caraati) the Self
(aatmaanam) through the Self (aatmanaa) as non-dual (anannyamayam), knows
(jaanaati), and sees (pasyaati), is (sah) indeed (niischita: bhaavati) Conduct
(chaaritram), Knowledge (jnaanam), and Vision (darshanam).  **Commentary:** This
verse emphasizes the non-dual nature of the Self, which is the essence of
Conduct, Knowledge, and Vision. The Self, being non-dual, is the very essence of
liberation. The Self, being the doer, the action, and the instrument, is
established as one and the same. Therefore, the Self, being the essence of
Conduct, Knowledge, and Vision, is the path to liberation, which is
characterized by the conduct of the Self, as determined by the nature of the
Self.  **Translation:**  The one who walks, knows, and sees the Self as non-dual
with the Self, through the Self, is indeed established as Conduct, Knowledge,
and Vision. This means that the Self, being non-dual, is the very essence of
Conduct, Knowledge, and Vision. The Self, being the doer, the action, and the
instrument, is established as one and the same. Therefore, the Self, being the
essence of Conduct, Knowledge, and Vision, is the path to liberation, which is
characterized by the conduct of the Self, as determined by the nature of the
Self.

386 . The path to liberation, the index of the universe, the small, the Hindi,
the date-the Uththānika-further, by the principle of non-duality, this soul
itself is the form of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, thus,
they strengthen the path to liberation already mentioned. With the meaning in
the order of the words-(who) someone (by their own soul) by the soul itself (the
soul form) their own soul (believes in), (knows), (conducts) acts (this) this
(is decided) with certainty (right faith, knowledge, and conduct, it becomes).
Specific meaning-Whoever, becoming absorbed in the knowledge of their own self-
awareness, free from attachment, sees their own inner self, free from falsehood
and attachment, and united with infinite virtues like omniscience, as pure soul,
in the form of pure existence, without any discrimination, or believes in the
pure soul, free from opposite opinions, with the beautiful culmination of their
own self-awareness, knows it through the knowledge of self-awareness, free from
defilements, as different from attachment, and experiences it with complete
absorption in it, that is the certainty of the three jewels. In this sutra, the
soul itself is called the three forms of right faith, knowledge, and conduct,
from the perspective of non-duality. From this, it is known that just as sherbet
made from grapes, dates, etc., is called one, even though it is made of many
things, similarly, from the perspective of non-duality, the one certainty of the
three jewels is the nature of the living being, and the steady conduct is the
path to liberation. This is the meaning. Similarly, in other texts, the
characteristics of this certainty of the three jewels, dependent on the soul,
are mentioned. Interest in the soul is right faith-the knowledge of it is called
right knowledge, and the stability of that soul itself is conduct. This is the
cause of liberation, the practice of yoga. 162. In this way, two verses are
completed, mainly describing the path to liberation. The denial of the
eligibility of all beings in the world for the path to liberation. Whoever knows
everything, sees everything, experiences happiness by that. Thus, knowing that,
the future being, the non-future being, does not doubt. 163. Whoever knows
everything, sees everything, experiences happiness by that. Thus, knowing that,
the future being, the non-future being, does not doubt. 163. Here, happiness is
due to the absence of the cause of opposition to one's nature. The nature of the
soul is to know and see. The obstacle to the object of these two is opposition.
In liberation, the soul sees everything, and there is no obstacle to that.
Therefore, the experience of the ultimate happiness, characterized by the
absence of disturbance, due to that cause, is unshakeable in liberation. This is
the future being...

**Verse 387**  He who knows all (**sarvam vijanati**) and sees all (**pasyati**)
when the soul is liberated, he experiences happiness (**saukhyam anubhavati**).
Such a being (**bhavya**) knows this, but an unrighteous being (**abhavya**)
does not believe it.  **Commentary**  This verse refutes the notion that all
beings are eligible for liberation. True happiness arises from the absence of
obstacles to one's inherent nature. The soul's inherent nature is perception
(**drishti**) and knowledge (**jnanpti**). Obstacles to these are the cause of
suffering. In liberation, the soul knows and sees everything, thus there are no
obstacles. Therefore, the soul experiences the unhindered bliss of liberation,
which is characterized by the absence of obstacles.  A righteous being
(**bhavya**) understands this and is therefore eligible for liberation. An
unrighteous being (**abhavya**) does not believe this and is therefore
ineligible for liberation.  Therefore, only a few beings are eligible for
liberation, not all.  **Verse 163**  Now, the text explains that one who has
faith in inherent happiness is a right-seeing being (**samyagdrishti**). This
being (**jiva**) knows all (**sarvam**) - the entire universe (**jagat**) across
all three times (**trayakalatrayavarthi**) - with perfect knowledge
(**kevalgyan**) free from doubt, error, and attachment. He not only knows but
also sees (**pechchhadi**) everything with the perfect vision (**kevaldarshan**)
that illuminates the universe (**lokaalokaprakashak**). He experiences happiness
(**sokkham abhavati**) because of this perfect knowledge and vision. Such a
being (**bhavya**) knows this, as explained earlier, and has faith in this
infinite happiness (**tadananta sukham**). He experiences this happiness
according to his own qualities (**svakiyagunasthananusarenam anubhavati cha**).
An unrighteous being (**abhavya**) does not believe this. For example, even
though a righteous being (**bhavya**) experiences worldly pleasures
(**vishayasukham**) due to the weakening of the seven vices
(**mithyatvadisaptprakrti**) and the destruction of karma (**charitram ohasya ch
oupashamak shayopaashamak shaye sati**), he considers the transcendental
happiness (**atiindriyasukham**) arising from the realization of his pure soul
(**nijasuddhatma bhavanotpannam**) as the ultimate goal. An unrighteous being
(**abhavya**) does not do this. Why? Because he does not experience the
destruction of karma, the weakening of the seven vices, and the perfect vision
and knowledge (**darshan charitram ohaniyopaashamadhikam na sambhavati
tathachaiva abhavya iti bhavartha**).  Thus, the seventh verse (**saptama sthule
gatha**) primarily describes the nature of righteous and unrighteous beings
(**bhavyaabhavya swaroop kathana mukhyatvena**).  **Hindi Translation**
**Uththānikā** - Further, it is shown that one who has faith in inherent
happiness is a right-seeing being (**samyagdrishti**).  **Anvaya with General
Meaning** - This soul (**so**) with perfect knowledge (**jena**) knows all
(**savvam**) ...

388 The liberated soul (**vijāṇadi**) knows (**pechchhadi**) sees (**teṇa**) by
that (**sokkham**) happiness (**aṇuhavdi**) experiences (**bhavīo**) the worthy
soul (**taṃ**) that happiness (**idi**) in the same way (**jāṇadi**) knows
(**abhavya satto**) the unworthy soul (**ṇa**) not (**sahahadi**) believes.
**Special Meaning:** This soul, by the illuminating knowledge of the omniscient,
knows the three groups of objects of the three worlds, which are free from
doubt, error, and indecision, and which exist in the three periods of time. And
by the omniscient vision, it sees all of them together. And by those very
omniscient knowledge and omniscient vision, it continuously experiences the
happiness that is inseparable from them. The one who believes in this kind of
infinite happiness and experiences it according to his own state of being is the
worthy soul. The unworthy soul does not have such belief.  The worthy soul, with
the suppression or destruction of the seven natures, including false vision,
etc., and with the suppression or destruction of the conduct-delusion, according
to his own state of being, experiences the happiness of the objects, even though
he understands that they are worthy of being abandoned. However, he considers
the transcendental happiness arising from the feeling of his pure soul to be
worthy of being accepted or adopted. The reason for this is that it is not
possible for him to have the suppression or destruction of the vision-delusion
and the conduct-delusion, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, he is called
unworthy. This is the meaning.  Thus, the seventh chapter ends with the main
point of describing the nature of the worthy and the unworthy.  This shows that
the nature of the soul is fixed in its conduct, and that the omniscient is the
direct cause of liberation, by showing the causal relationship of vision,
knowledge, and conduct. Vision, knowledge, and conduct are to be followed as the
path to liberation. This is said by the virtuous, and by them, both bondage and
liberation.  Vision, knowledge, and conduct are to be followed as the path to
liberation. This is said by the virtuous, and by them, both bondage and
liberation.  These vision, knowledge, and conduct, even if they are slightly
contaminated by the influence of the other time, are held like ghee that is
contaminated with a little bit of water. When they are in harmony with their own
time, by the cessation of the influence of the other time, they become like ghee
that is free from contamination, and they are the cause of bondage, because they
are established in the relationship of cause and effect.

389 The five astikayas, due to the presence or absence of the cause of their
existence, are themselves the direct causes of liberation. Therefore, the
conduct that is inherent in the nature of the soul, which is called
"svamsamayaprativritti," is established as the direct path to liberation. || 164
||  Anvayaartha - (darshan jnana charitraani) Darshan, jnana, and charitra
(mokshamārgaḥ) are the path to liberation (iti) therefore (sevitavyāni) they are
worthy of being practiced - (idam sādhubhiḥ bhaṇitam) this has been said by the
virtuous, (taiḥ tu) but by them (bandhaḥ vā) bondage also occurs. (mokṣaḥ vā)
liberation also occurs.  Tika - Here, by showing that darshan, jnana, and
charitra are sometimes the cause of bondage, the direct cause of liberation in
the nature of the soul is illuminated. This darshan, jnana, and charitra, even
if they are small, if they are combined with parsamayaprativritti, like ghee
combined with fire, are also the cause of bondage due to the pervasiveness of
the cause of the opposite action. And when (these darshan, jnana, and charitra),
are combined with svamsamayaprativritti, which is the form of renunciation from
all parsamayaprativritti, then, like ghee that is separated from fire, due to
the absence of the cause of the opposite action, they are the direct cause of
liberation. Therefore, the conduct that is inherent in the nature of the soul,
which is called "svamsamayaprativritti," becomes the direct path to liberation.

390 The path to liberation (moksha) is characterized by right faith
(samyakdarshan), right knowledge (samyakgyan), and right conduct
(samyakcharitra). When these three jewels (ratnatraya) are rooted in the pure
soul (shuddhatma), they lead to liberation. However, when they are rooted in
anything other than the pure soul, they lead to bondage.   An analogy can be
drawn: just as ghee and other substances, though naturally cold, become hot due
to contact with fire, similarly, these three jewels, though naturally conducive
to liberation, become the cause of virtuous bondage when they are rooted in
auspicious substances like the five supreme beings (panchaparameshthi).
Likewise, when these same faith, knowledge, and conduct are rooted in false
faith (mithyadarshan), objects of sense perception (vishaya), and passions
(kṣaya), they become the cause of sinful bondage.   Therefore, it is established
that unwavering conduct rooted in the soul is the path to liberation. ||164||
Thus, the verse concludes by stating that liberation arises from pure three
jewels, while virtuous bondage arises from impure three jewels.  This is an
explanation of the subtle nature of the ultimate reality (parasamaya). If a
knowledgeable person believes that liberation arises from pure association
(shuddhasamprayoga), then that person is attached to the ultimate reality
(parasamayarata). ||165||  **Translation of the Sanskrit verse:**  If a
knowledgeable person believes that liberation arises from pure association
(shuddhasamprayoga) due to ignorance, then that person is attached to the
ultimate reality (parasamayarata). ||165||  **Commentary:**  Here, "pure
association" refers to the state of mind that is imbued with devotion towards
the liberated ones (arhatadi) like the Tirthankaras. If a knowledgeable person,
due to a tinge of ignorance, believes that liberation arises from this pure
association and strives for it, then even they are considered attached to the
ultimate reality because of the presence of a tinge of passion (raga).
Therefore, what about a person whose inner state is tainted by unbridled passion
(nirankusha raga)? Surely, they too would be considered attached to the ultimate
reality. ||165||  **Explanation of the Sanskrit terms:**  * **Moksha:**
Liberation from the cycle of birth and death. * **Samyakdarshan:** Right faith,
the correct understanding of reality. * **Samyakgyan:** Right knowledge, the
true understanding of the self and the world. * **Samyakcharitra:** Right
conduct, living a life of non-violence, truthfulness, and non-attachment. *
**Ratnatraya:** The three jewels of Jainism: right faith, right knowledge, and
right conduct. * **Shuddhatma:** The pure soul, the true self. *
**Panchaparameshthi:** The five supreme beings: the Tirthankaras, the Siddhas,
the Acharyas, the Upadhyayas, and the Sadhus. * **Mithyadarshan:** False faith,
a distorted view of reality. * **Vishaya:** Objects of sense perception. *
**Kṣaya:** Passions, negative emotions like anger, greed, and pride. *
**Parasamaya:** The ultimate reality, the true nature of existence. *
**Shuddhasamprayoga:** Pure association, a state of mind characterized by
devotion and purity. * **Parasamayarata:** Attached to the ultimate reality, a
state of being focused on the true nature of existence.

There are five verses following this, which explain the subtle time (sookshma
parsamaya). Among them, one verse is the essence of the topic, three verses
elaborate on it, and one verse summarizes it. Thus, there are nine verses in
total, which are a collection of verses on the topic.  Now, the nature of subtle
time is explained: If a knower (gnani) believes that liberation from suffering
(dukkha mokkha) is achieved through ignorance (agnaana) rather than through
devotion to the pure soul (shuddha atma), then that being (jiva) is attached to
the subtle time (parasamaya). Why is this so? Because devotion (bhakti) is the
association (samprayoga) with the pure (shuddha) - those who are pure in their
nature (shuddha buddhak swabhaava), those who are the embodiment of pure
consciousness (shuddha buddheka swabhaavaaraadhake), like the great ones
(vaarhadaadi). This association (samprayoga) is pure association (shuddha
samprayoga). Then, what is the state of such a being? They are attached to the
subtle time (parasamaya rato). This is the knower (gnani) as described earlier.
For example, if a person desires to remain in the state of perfect equanimity
(parama upeksha samyama) characterized by the contemplation of the pure soul
(nirvikaar shuddhaatma bhaavana), but is unable to do so, and instead engages in
devotion (bhakti) to the five great ones (pancha parameshthi) in the form of
praising their qualities (gunastavanaadi), then they become attached to the
subtle time (sookshma parsamaya parinata) and develop a passionate right view
(saraga samyagdrishti). However, if someone, even though capable of
contemplating the pure soul (shuddhaatma bhaavana), abandons it and believes
that liberation (moksha) is achieved solely through good deeds (shubhopayoga),
then they become attached to the gross time (sthoola parsamaya parinaama) and
become an ignorant (agnaani) false believer (mithyaavrishti). Consequently, due
to this ignorance (agnaana), the being (jiva) perishes.  As it is said: "Some
are lost due to ignorance (agnaana), some due to carelessness (pramada), some
due to the taint of knowledge (gnaanaalepa), and some are destroyed by their own
actions (naashita)." || 165 ||

392 If someone becomes a **Samyagdrusti** with **Saraag** (attachment) and
**Chulika** (subtle attachment) in the **Mokshamarg** (path to liberation), and
if they are able to contemplate the soul, even then, they will be liberated from
the world only through devotion, which is a **Shubhopayog** (beneficial use). If
they believe this absolutely, then due to the subtle **Parasamaya** (ultimate
time) effect, they will become ignorant and **Mithyadristi** (falsely seeing).
This proves that ignorance harms the soul. It is said:  How many souls are
corrupted by ignorance, how many are destroyed by carelessness, how many harm
themselves by the touch of knowledge, i.e., knowledge without experience, and
how many souls are destroyed by those who are themselves lost and wandering!
165.  The above **Shuddhasamprayog** (pure practice) is negated as a cause of
bondage, as it is not the path to liberation. One who is endowed with devotion
to **Arhat** (liberated soul), **Siddh** (liberated soul), **Chaitya** (image of
an Arhat), **Pravachan** (scripture), **Gan** (group of monks), **Naaan**
(knowledge), and **Bhakti** (devotion), binds much merit, but does not destroy
karma. 166.  One who is endowed with devotion to Arhat, Siddha, Chaitya,
Pravachan, Gan, Naaan, and Bhakti, even though he is engaged in
**Shuddhasamprayog**, due to the attachment to the soul, does not abandon the
**Shubhopayog** and binds much merit, but does not destroy all karma. Therefore,
even a particle of attachment should be abandoned, as it is the cause of
**Parasamaya** (ultimate time) activity. 166.  Meaning: One who is endowed with
devotion to Arhat, Siddha, Chaitya, Pravachan, Gan, and Naaan, binds much merit,
but does not actually destroy karma. 166.  Commentary: Here, the previously
mentioned **Shuddhasamprayog** is negated as a cause of bondage, as it is not
the path to liberation. Even though one is engaged in **Shuddhasamprayog**, due
to the attachment to the soul, he does not abandon the **Shubhopayog** and binds
much merit, but does not actually destroy all karma. Therefore, even a particle
of attachment should be abandoned, as it is the cause of **Parasamaya**
(ultimate time) activity. 166.  Summary: The above **Shuddhasamprayog** is
negated as a cause of bondage, as it is not the path to liberation. One who is
endowed with devotion to Arhat, Siddha, Chaitya, Pravachan, Gan, Naaan, and
Bhakti, binds much merit, but does not destroy karma. 166.

## 393 This sūtra shows that the devotion to the pure soul, as mentioned
earlier, leads to the bondage of karma, and thus it prohibits the attainment of
liberation through it.  **General Meaning with Anvaya:** (Arhant-siddh-cheddiy-
pavayan-ganna-na-bhatti-sampanno) One who is devoted to the Arhant Bhagwan, the
Siddha Paramatma, their images, Jain principles, the group of Munis, and
knowledge (bahusha) mostly (punnam) creates karmic bondage (bandhi) (du) but
(so) he (kamp-khayam) does not destroy karma.  **Specific Meaning:** The essence
of this sūtra is that liberation is attained through the experience of the pure
self, free from any influx. Therefore, liberation through attachment to any
object is prohibited. ||166||  **This sūtra indicates that the absence of the
realization of one's own true self is solely due to attachment.** For whoever
has even a tiny bit of attachment to external objects in their heart, even if
they are well-versed in all the scriptures, they will not know their own true
self. ||167||  **Anvaya:** (Yasyah hridaye) In whose heart (paradravyah) towards
external objects (anu-matrah va) even a tiny bit (lesha-matrah bhi) [raghah]
attachment (vidyate) exists (sah) he, (sarva-agam-dharah api) even if he is
well-versed in all the scriptures, (svakasyah samaayam na vijanati) does not
know (does not experience) his own true self.  **Commentary:** Here, the absence
of the realization of one's own true self is shown to be solely due to
attachment.  Whoever has even a tiny bit of attachment in their heart, even if
they are well-versed in all the scriptures, they do not truly realize their
pure, unattached nature and their own true self. Therefore, to realize one's
true self, just as one removes cotton stuck to a wick, one must gradually
eliminate even the smallest traces of attachment to external objects, including
those related to Arhathood. ||167||  **It is then explained that the realization
of the pure self is hindered by external objects.** For whoever has even a tiny
bit of attachment to external objects, whether good or bad, in their heart and
mind, they will not truly realize their own true self.

This is a passage from the Jain scripture, the Tattvartha Sutra, discussing the
root cause of suffering and the path to liberation.   **English Translation:**
**Verse 168:**  "Indeed, in this world, devotion to the Arhats (liberated souls)
and others does not occur without the influence of attachment (raga). When
attachment and its associated passions arise, the soul cannot be kept free from
the cycle of rebirth (samsara). And when the cycle of rebirth continues, there
is no restraint of auspicious and inauspicious karma. Therefore, this is the
enjoyment of the affliction of attachment, which is the root of the continuous
stream of suffering."  **Commentary:**  "Thus, it is taught that attachment is
the root of all suffering. For one who is unable to restrain the delusion of the
mind, without the awareness of one's own pure self, there is no restraint of
auspicious and inauspicious karma. Why? Because there is no restraint of
auspicious and inauspicious karma for one who is unable to restrain the delusion
of the mind, without the awareness of one's own pure self. For example, one who
does not cultivate the awareness of one's own self, which is eternally blissful
and of one nature, cannot restrain the spread of the intellect, which is in the
form of all the objects of knowledge, including illusion, falsehood, and the
causes of suffering. And without restraint of the intellect, there is no
restraint of auspicious and inauspicious karma. Therefore, it is established
that attachment and its associated passions are the root of all suffering."
**Verse 169:**  "Therefore, desiring liberation, becoming free from attachment
and ego, one should again cultivate devotion to the Siddhas (liberated souls).
By that, one attains liberation."  **Commentary:**  "Since it has been said that
attachment and its associated passions lead to delusion of the mind, and
delusion of the mind leads to karmic bondage, therefore, one who desires
liberation..."

396 The root of karma-bandha is the delusion of the mind, which is caused by the
attachment to the objects of the senses. This attachment must be completely
eradicated. When it is eradicated, the soul, which is free from attachment and
ego, attains the true devotion to the Siddhas, which is the state of being
established in the pure Self. This is the true nature of the Siddhas. Because of
this, the soul, which has completely eradicated karma-bandha, attains
liberation. ||169||  Anvaya-artha: Therefore, the soul, which desires
liberation, becomes free from attachment and ego, and thus attains devotion to
the Siddhas. Therefore, he attains liberation.  Tika: This verse explains the
complete eradication of the two defects.  It was previously stated that the
delusion of the mind is caused by the attachment to the objects of the senses,
and that this delusion leads to karma-bandha. Therefore, the soul, who desires
liberation, must completely eradicate the root of karma-bandha, which is the
delusion of the mind, which is caused by the attachment to the objects of the
senses. When this attachment is completely eradicated, the soul, who is free
from attachment and ego, attains the true devotion to the Siddhas, which is the
state of being established in the pure Self. This is the true nature of the
Siddhas. Because of this, the soul, which has completely eradicated karma-
bandha, attains liberation. ||169||  Therefore, the Acharya, in his explanation
of the subtle paryay, concludes by saying that the soul, who desires liberation,
must eradicate the root of the attachment to the objects of the senses, which is
the cause of the inflow of karma. The Acharya says that the soul, who desires
liberation, is free from attachment because he is free from the external and
internal attachment to the objects of the senses. He is also free from ego
because he is free from the delusion that arises from the attachment to the
objects of the senses. He then says that the soul, who desires liberation,
becomes free from attachment and ego, and thus attains devotion to the Siddhas.
This devotion is the true knowledge of the Self. Because of this devotion, the
soul attains liberation. ||169||  Thus, the five verses in the ninth chapter of
the Tattvartha Sutra are primarily concerned with the explanation of the subtle
paryay.  Hindi Ta: It is appropriate for the soul, who desires liberation, to
eradicate the root of the inflow of karma, which is the attachment to the
objects of the senses. Therefore, the Acharya concludes his explanation of the
subtle paryay by saying: Anvaya with general meaning: [Therefore] the soul, who
desires liberation, [becomes free from attachment] by being free from
attachment, [and] [becomes free from ego] by being free from ego, [then]
[attains devotion to the Siddhas]. In this way, he [attains liberation].

## Pancastikaya Prabhrut 397  **Special Meaning:** The four gathas starting with
"Annanado Nani" explain the cause of asrava through the web of vikalpa
(fluctuations) arising from raga (attachment) etc. Therefore, a person who
desires liberation should be free from external and internal possessions,
contrary to the essence of the soul, and free from the web of vikalpa arising
from moha (delusion) which is born from the rise of mamkara (ego) and ahankara
(sense of self), contrary to the luminous essence of the soul. He should
consider himself as a Siddha (liberated soul) and practice Siddha bhakti
(devotion to the liberated soul) in his pure spiritual qualities, believing that
his soul has infinite qualities. This leads to the attainment of pure soul,
which is the benefit of nirvana. || 169 ||  **Explanation:** This indicates the
presence of the cause of liberation through tradition, even though there is no
direct cause of liberation in the practice of parmasamaya (supreme practice) in
the form of devotion to Arhat etc.  **Verse 170:**  **With meaning:** The one
who has attained the knowledge of the Tirthankara, whose mind is illuminated by
the sutras, and who is engaged in austerity and restraint, is still far from
liberation.  **With meaning:** The one who has attained the knowledge of the
Tirthankara, whose mind is illuminated by the sutras, and who is engaged in
austerity and restraint, is still far from liberation.  **Explanation:** Whoever
is truly motivated for liberation, even though he has acquired an inconceivable
burden of austerity and restraint, and even though he has not developed the
power to ascend to the state of supreme detachment, cannot abandon the practice
of parmasamaya, which is attractive in the form of devotion to Arhat etc., along
with the nine substances, like a piece of cotton stuck to a wick. He does not
attain liberation directly, but attains it indirectly through the suffering of
the heavenly realms etc. || 170 ||  **Meaning of the verse:** Even though (he
is) engaged in austerity and restraint, (he has attained the knowledge of the
Tirthankara) whose mind is inclined towards the nine substances and the
Tirthankara, and (whose mind is illuminated by the sutras) who has a liking
(love) for the sutras, for that being, (liberation) is (far away).
**Commentary:** Here, even though there is no direct cause of liberation in the
practice of parmasamaya in the form of devotion to Arhat etc., the presence of
the cause of liberation through tradition is shown.  The being who is truly
motivated for liberation, even though he has acquired an inconceivable burden of
austerity and restraint, and even though he has not developed the power to
ascend to the state of supreme detachment, cannot abandon the practice of
parmasamaya, which is attractive in the form of devotion to Arhat etc., along
with the nine substances, like a piece of cotton stuck to a wick. He does not
attain liberation directly, but attains it indirectly through the suffering of
the heavenly realms etc. || 170 ||

## Translation:  **Panchaastikaya Prabhrut** 399  **Special Meaning:** One who
is free from the defilements of attachment, aversion, and delusion due to the
strength of external sensory restraint and the protection of living beings, and
who, without the fire of desires like fame, worship, profit, and their mental
counterparts, has become a renunciant muni by dwelling in his pure soul for the
sake of self-control, and who, through the strength of various external
austerities like fasting, and through the internal austerity of restraining the
desire for all external objects, practices tapas in the state of eternal bliss
and oneness. Even while practicing tapas, when he is unable to constantly dwell
in his true nature due to the lack of special strength like endurance, he
sometimes develops love for the scriptures that describe the soul and other
substances, sometimes, like a man who gives gifts and honors to men who come
near his wife who has gone to another country, he listens to the stories of the
liberated soul, the Tirthankaras, the great beings like the Ganadharas, Bharata,
Sagara, Rama, and the Pandavas, with the desire to win the liberated soul, the
woman, and to avoid evil attachment and to develop love for the good Dharma. In
the householder stage, he gives gifts and honors to the Acharyas, Upadhyayas,
and Sadhus who are devoted to the three jewels of faith, conduct, and knowledge.
Therefore, although he breaks through the cycle of endless births and deaths, if
he is not a liberated soul, he cannot destroy all his karmas in that very birth.
However, due to the effect of the stream of merit, he does not attain liberation
in that very birth but attains the position of Indra and other deities in
another birth. Even there, he considers the celestial chariots, palaces, and
other glories as insignificant, and going to the five great realms, he sees the
liberated, omniscient, and passionless Arhat Bhagwan in the Samavasarana and
bows to the Ganadharas and other devotees of the pure soul. Then, firmly
established in the pure Dharma, he does not abandon the contemplation of the
soul, which is worthy of the fourth stage of spiritual development, and remains
in the celestial realm until the time of his death. Then, at the end of his
lifespan, he comes down from heaven and attains the glory of a Chakravarti and
other kings in the human realm. Even then, due to the strength of the
contemplation of the pure soul that he had in his previous births, he does not
become attached to it. Then, abandoning worldly pleasures, he takes Jain
initiation and, through the method of non-dualistic samadhi, he dwells in his
pure soul, which is the nature of pure knowledge and vision, and attains
liberation. This is the meaning. || 170 ||  **Arhadyadi Bhaktimatra Ragajanita
Sakshanmokshasya Antarayadyotanamet**  **Arhant - Siddha - Chaitya Payan -
Bhakto Parena Niyamen** **Yo Kunati Tavokampa So Suralogam Samadir Yaad** || 171
||  **Arhat Siddha Chaitya Pravachana Bhaktah Parena Niyamen** **Yah Karoti
Tapas Karma Sa Suralogam Samadatte** || 171 ||  **Translation:**  This indicates
that mere devotion to the Arhat and others is an obstacle to direct liberation,
which is born of attachment.  One who is devoted to the Arhat, the liberated
soul, the holy place, and the teachings, but who does not practice self-control,
will attain the celestial realm. || 171 ||  One who is devoted to the Arhat, the
liberated soul, the holy place, and the teachings, but who practices austerities
with the intention of gaining karmic rewards, will attain the celestial realm.

400 The one who, being devoted to the Arhats, Siddhas, Chaityas (images of the
Arhats), and the Pravachana (scripture), performs intense austerities with
supreme restraint, is merely adorned with the taint of passion within. He is
deluded by the poison of worldly objects and attains the heavenly realm, which
is an obstacle to liberation. He is then cooked by the fires of passion for a
long time and suffers within. || 171 ||  Anvaya: [Ya:] The one who [Arhat Siddha

of the Arhats), and the Pravachana (scripture), [Parena Niyamen:] with supreme
restraint [Tapa Karma:] performs austerities [Karati:] does [Sa:] he [Suraloka:]
attain the heavenly realm.  Commentary: This is a revelation of the obstacle to
liberation, which is merely the passion arising from devotion to the Arhats,
etc. The one who, being truly devoted to the Arhats, etc., with a mind subject
to such devotion, performs intense austerities with supreme restraint, is merely
adorned with the taint of passion within. He is deluded by the poison of worldly
objects and attains the heavenly realm, which is an obstacle to liberation. He
is then cooked by the fires of passion for a long time and suffers within. ||
171 ||  Sanskrit Commentary: In the previous sutra, it was said that one who is
devoted to the Tirthankaras, etc., does not attain liberation in that very life,
but only acquires karmic bondage. This sutra reinforces that meaning. [Ya:] The
one who [Arhat Siddha Chaitya Pravachana Bhakta:] is devoted to the Arhats,
Siddhas, Chaityas (images of the Arhats), and the Pravachana (scripture),
[Parena:] with supreme excellence [Y: Kश्चित् करोति:] performs something. What
is that? [Tapa Karma:] Austerities. [Sa:] He [Niyamen:] by rule [Suraloka:]
attains the heavenly realm. This means that he attains the heavenly realm. In
this sutra, the one who, taking pure self as the object, performs liberation or
vows, austerities, etc., according to the scriptures, becomes a right-view
holder due to the result without cause. However, due to the lack of power to
destroy karmic bondage, he is unable to remain in the state of pure self.
Therefore, in the present life, he only acquires karmic bondage. In the next
life, due to the constant contemplation of the Supreme Self, he attains
liberation by rule. Conversely, even in the next life, there is no rule of
liberation for the one who is not devoted to the Supreme Self. This is the
meaning of the sutra. || 171 ||  Hindi Commentary: Uththānikā: In the previous
sutra, it was said that one who is devoted to the Tirthankaras, etc., does not
attain liberation in that very life, but only acquires karmic bondage. This
sutra reinforces that meaning.  Anvaya with General Meaning: [Jo] The one who
[Arhant Siddha Chediy Parvayan Bhatto] is devoted to the Arhant, Siddha, Arhat
image, and the Jina's teachings, [Parena] with supreme excellence [Tavokamm]
performs austerities, [Kunati] does [So] he [Niyamen] by rule [Suralogam]
attains the heavenly realm.

Panchastikaya Prabhrit Vishesha-artha:  This sutra conveys that whoever
practices vows, austerities, etc. by considering the pure soul as worthy of
attainment or by understanding moksha as worthy of attainment from the language
of the scriptures, is a samyagdrashti (right-visioned) with a pure intent,
devoid of ulterior motives. If they do not have the appropriate strength of
karmic bondage, etc., then despite being unable to stabilize in the nature of
the pure soul, they still accumulate merit in the present life. In a future
life, when the contemplation of the Supreme Self becomes stable, they are surely
liberated. However, one who is the opposite of this does not have the rule of
attaining moksha even in a future life.  In this way, two verses were completed
in the tenth place, primarily through the exposition of the person who is not a
charmashariri (embodied being).  This is the concluding summary of the essential
meaning of the scriptures, which indicates the path to moksha. Therefore, one
desirous of liberation should not have any attachment anywhere. By becoming free
from attachment, the aspirant crosses the ocean of worldly existence.  The
essence is that vairagya (detachment) is the direct cause of moksha.
Comprehending the attachment even in the state of the Arhat, etc. as similar to
the fire that burns the celestial abodes, the great one desirous of immediate
liberation completely renounces all attachment, becomes absolutely detached,
crosses the terrifying ocean of worldly existence scorched by the fire of karma,
and attains the nectar-like ocean of the pure self.  Enough with the
elaboration. There are indeed two essential meanings - the meaning of the sutra
and the meaning of the scripture. The meaning of the sutra has been expounded
verse by verse. The meaning of the scripture is as follows:  The essential
purpose of this supreme scripture is to impart the knowledge of the tattva
(reality) of moksha, which is the essence of all human goals. This is
accomplished by expounding the nature of the panchastikaya (five substances) and
shaddaravya (six substances), which reveals the inherent nature of all entities.
It also elucidates the concepts related to bandha (bondage) and moksha, the
means to moksha, the distinction between vyavahara (practical) and nischaya
(absolute) moksha paths, and the supreme state of vairagya (detachment), which
is the direct cause of moksha.   This vairagya, when followed in harmony with
the practical and absolute perspectives, leads to the desired fulfillment, and
not otherwise. The primary aspirants, through the perspective of vyavahara,
easily enter the ford, being habituated by the beginningless distinction between
the means and the goal to be achieved.

This is the path to liberation, the essence of the universe, the subtle and the
gross, the knowable and the unknowable. This is the path I choose, the path of
the liberated.  Those who are dedicated to this path, with their minds
illuminated by the understanding of the division of action, inaction, and the
agent of action, gradually eradicate the roots of delusion. Sometimes, due to
ignorance, pride, and carelessness, they become lax in their self-control and
are subjected to severe punishments to guide them back to the righteous path.
They repeatedly receive atonement for their transgressions.  Their minds,
constantly purified by faith, knowledge, and conduct, are like soiled garments
washed clean by the pure water flowing over a smooth stone. They gradually
attain the certainty of the non-existence of the duality of means and ends, and
find rest in the pure, radiant, and blissful Self, free from all the
complexities of rituals and external practices.  They gradually attain the state
of equanimity, transcend all attachments, and experience liberation directly.
Those who are attached to worldly affairs, however, are constantly troubled by
the perception of the duality of means and ends. Their minds, filled with the
seeds of faith in rituals and other beliefs, are clouded by a multitude of
thoughts and doubts. They are tossed about by the waves of the ocean of rituals
and practices. Sometimes they are attracted to something, sometimes they
contemplate, sometimes they act, sometimes they calm down, sometimes they become
agitated, sometimes they feel compassion, sometimes they become arrogant. They
are constantly engaged in dispelling doubts, uncertainties, and confusion. They
nurture their attachment to worldly life, and strive to maintain their position,
seeking affection and influence. They observe the time for study and practice,
often feigning humility, and are burdened by the weight of rituals. They are
careful to maintain their wealth and reputation, and are vigilant in their
conduct. They are dedicated to the five great vows of non-violence,
truthfulness, non-stealing, non-possession, and non-attachment. They are deeply
engaged in the practices of restraint and self-control. They are diligent in
their speech, actions, giving, receiving, and renunciation. They are constantly
striving to practice austerities, including fasting, simplicity, renunciation of
taste, avoidance of company, and solitary sleep and sitting. They are
disciplined by the practices of atonement, humility, non-attachment, non-
indulgence, study, and meditation. They are fully engaged in the rituals and
practices, driven by the desire for good karma. Even though they are primarily
motivated by karma, they still acquire good karma. They are unable to even
imagine the unity of knowledge, faith, and conduct, which transcends all rituals
and practices. Their minds are burdened by the weight of good karma, and they
continue to wander in the ocean of existence, destined to experience the
suffering of the heavenly realms.  As it is said:  "Those who abandon the
practice of the path, and who are attached to the world, are like those who are
lost in the wilderness. They do not know the essence of the path, which is the
purity of the mind."

404 There are two types of meaning of the *Mokshamarga Prapancha Suchi* -
*Sutratatparya* and *Shastratatparya*. The *Sutratatparya* is explained in each
*sutra* (each *gatha*), and the *Shastratatparya* is explained now.  The purpose
of this *Yatharth Parageshwar Shastra* is to explain the essence of *Moksha*
(liberation) in all *purusharthas* (goals of human life), which shows the nature
of all things through the explanation of the nature of the *Panchaastikaya*
(five bodies) and *Shaddravya* (six substances). It explains the nine substances
in detail, revealing the *bandha* (bondage) and *moksha* (liberation) related to
the *swami* (self), the *ayatan* (space) of *bandha* and *moksha*, and the
*vikalpa* (difference) of *bandha* and *moksha*. It clearly explains the
*Mokshamarga* (path to liberation) in the form of *nishcaya* (certainty) and
*vyavahar* (practicality), and its entire heart is situated in the
*paramveetraragapana* (supreme detachment) which is the cause of direct
*moksha*.  Therefore, the meaning of this *veetraragapana* is to follow it
without contradicting *vyavahar* and *nishcaya*, which leads to the desired
success, but not otherwise.  (The above is explained in detail)  Due to the
*bhedavasit buddhi* (intellect stained with differentiation) since time
immemorial, the primary *jivas* (souls) follow the *vyavahar* (practical) path,
taking refuge in the *bhinnsadhya sadhanabhava* (different means for different
ends), and happily (easily, smoothly) descend on the *tirtham* (pilgrimage) -
*Mokshamarga* (path to liberation).  For example, "(1) This is *shraddhey*
(worthy of faith), (2) This is *ashraddhey* (not worthy of faith), (3) This is
*shraddha karne wala* (one who has faith), and (4) This is *shraddha* (faith),
(1) This is *jney* (worthy of knowing), (2) This is *ajney* (not worthy of
knowing), (3) This is *jnata* (one who knows), and (4) This is *gyan*
(knowledge), (1) This is *acharaniy* (worthy of conduct), (2) This is
*anacharaniy* (not worthy of conduct), (3) This is *acharan karne wala* (one who
conducts), and (4) This is *acharan* (conduct), (1) This is *kartavya* (worthy
of doing), (2) This is *akartavya* (not worthy of doing), (3) This is *karta*
(doer), and (4) This is *karma* (action)." - By observing these divisions, in
which beautiful enthusiasm is aroused, they (primary *jivas*) gradually uproot
*mohamalla* (attachment, etc.), and perhaps due to ignorance (lack of complete
knowledge), they become overpowered by *mad* (passion) and *pramad*
(carelessness), and their *atmaadhikarya* (right over the soul) becomes weak
(excessive), so they use *prachand dandanetika* (penance) to guide them back to
the path of justice. They continuously strive, repeatedly performing
*prayaschitta* (penance) according to their faults, and through *shraddhan*
(faith), *gyan* (knowledge), and *charitra* (conduct) related to different
subjects (through these three gems of differentiation), they gradually acquire
*sanskar* (impressions) in their souls. Like a dirty cloth that is beaten on a
stone surface by a washerman, soaked in clean water, and rubbed with *kshar*
(soap), they gradually achieve purity (cleanliness) in their souls. Due to the
absence of *bhinnsadhya sadhanabhava* (different means for different ends) of
*nishchayanaya* (certainty), they find rest (stability) in the *bhagwan atma*
(divine soul), which is the form of the combined nature (non-differentiation) of
*darshan* (perception), *gyan* (knowledge), and *charitra* (conduct), which is
free from the pomp of rituals (due to the absence of rituals), is extremely pure
and conscious, and is full of independent joy.

From the five astikayas onwards, up to the 405th, the feeling of samarasibhava
gradually arises. Therefore, by attaining the supreme state of vitraragabhava,
they experience liberation directly.   This is called the **pravartan** (action)
and its **phala** (fruit) of the **kevalavyavaharabalambi** (ignorant) beings.
However, those who are **kevalavyavaharabalambi**, by observing the
**bhitrasadhyasadhanabhava** (the nature of the means to attain liberation),
constantly experience great **khed** (regret).   (1) Due to their mind being
constantly engaged in **shraddhanarupa adhyavasana** (firm determination) in
**dharma** (righteousness) etc.,   (2) Their **chaitanyavritti** (consciousness)
becomes **chitra-vichitra** (diverse) due to the **jal** (net) of **vichitra**
(various) **vikalpas** (thoughts) arising from the **sanskaras** (impressions)
of **dravya-shruta** (scriptural knowledge), and   (3) They remain **achalita**
(immobile) in the **dharmar** (pomp) of **pravartanarupa karmakanda**
(ritualistic practices) which are like **tan** (grass) in the form of
**samudaya** (collection) of **yati-acharale** (conduct of monks).   Therefore,
they sometimes take **ruchi** (interest) in something, sometimes **vikalpa**
(consider) something, sometimes engage in some **acharan** (conduct), sometimes
become **prashamta** (calm) for the sake of **darshanacharan** (seeing and
practicing), sometimes attain **sanveg** (enthusiasm), sometimes become
**anukampita** (compassionate), sometimes **dharan** (hold) **astikya** (faith),
and constantly strive to prevent the rise of **shanka** (doubt), **kanksha**
(desire), **vichchikittsa** (hesitation), and **muddhadrishtita** (ignorance).
They repeatedly increase their **utsaha** (enthusiasm) by **bha** (considering)
**upabrinhana** (strengthening), **sthitikaran** (stabilizing), **vatsalya**
(affection), and **pravana** (inclination).   They observe the **avlokan**
(observation) of **svadhyayakal** (time for self-study) for the sake of
**jnanaacharan** (knowledge and practice).   They **vistar** (expand) **vinaya**
(humility) in many ways.   They **dharana** (hold) **durdhar** (difficult)
**upadhana** (accessories).   They **prasarita** (spread) **bahuman** (respect)
properly.   They **nivarta** (prevent) **nihrvadoosha** (faults) completely.
They are extremely **savadhan** (careful) in the **shuddhi** (purity) of
**artha** (meaning), **vyanjan** (pronunciation), and **tadubhaya** (both).
For the sake of **charitraacharan** (conduct of character), they remain
**talliin** (immersed) in the **panchamahavrata** (five great vows) of
**sarvaviratirupa** (complete renunciation) of **himsa** (violence), **asatya**
(falsehood), **steya** (theft), **abrahma** (sexual misconduct), and
**parigraha** (possession).   They are extremely **udyoga** (industrious) in
**gupti** (secrets) whose **lakshana** (characteristic) is **samyak
yoganigraha** (proper control of the senses).   They **yukta** (apply)
**prayatna** (effort) completely in **samiti** (groups) of **irya** (walking),
**bhasha** (speech), **eshana** (desire), **adananiksepa** (giving and
receiving), and **utsarga** (abandonment).   For the sake of **tapaacharan**
(practice of austerities), they remain constantly **utsahi** (enthusiastic) in
**anashan** (fasting), **avamoudarya** (moderation), **vrittiparisankhyan**
(counting of breaths), **rasaparitaya** (renunciation of taste), **vivikta-
shayyasan** (solitary bed and seat), and **kayaklesha** (physical austerities).
They **ankushita** (control) their own **anta:karan** (inner mind) through
**prayashchitta** (penance), **vinaya** (humility), **vaiyavritti** (conduct of
a monk), **vyutsarga** (abandonment), **svadhyay** (self-study), and **dhyan**
(meditation).   For the sake of **viryaacharan** (conduct of effort), they
remain **sarva shakti vyapt** (all-powerful) in **karmakanda** (ritualistic
practices).   While doing so, due to their **karmachetnapraadhanapana** (being
dominated by karma), although they have completely **nivarana** (prevented) the
**ashubhakarmapravritti** (tendency towards evil karma), they have **grahana**
(accepted) the **shubhakarmapravritti** (tendency towards good karma) well.
However, they do not **utpanna** (generate) even a little **jnana-chetna**
(knowledge-consciousness) which is the **aikyaparinaati** (unified result) of
**darshan** (vision), **jnana** (knowledge), and **charitra** (conduct),
transcending the **adambar** (pomp) of all **kriyakanda** (actions).   They live
with a **mand** (dull) **chittavritti** (mind) burdened by **bahu punya** (much
merit).   Due to the **parampara** (tradition) of attaining **klesha**
(afflictions) of **devaloka** (heavenly realms) etc., they **bhraman** (wander)
in the **sansarsagar** (ocean of existence) for a very **dirghakal** (long
time).   It is also said:  **"Charan-karan-ppahana samaya-par-matthamuk-ka-va-
vara | Charan-karan-ssa saram nicchaya-sud-dhan jananti ||"**  **Meaning:**
Those who are **charan-karan** (action-oriented) and

## 406 **The Path to Liberation: A Guide to the Worldly (Now, the conduct and
its fruits of the ignorant beings who are only dependent on conviction are
described.)**  Now, those who are only dependent on conviction, while being
detached in their intellect from the pomp and show of all rituals, keep their
eyes downcast and remain at ease by observing everything with their own
intellect (i.e., they remain as they wish by imagining anything according to
their own mental constructs), they actually reject the nature of means that are
difficult to achieve and do not attain the nature of means that are easily
achievable. They remain in the middle (i.e., in the third state of evil, apart
from the good and pure), intoxicated with the intoxication of negligence, with a
lazy mind, like the intoxicated, like the unconscious, like the sleeping, like
those who have attained satisfaction after eating a lot of ghee, sugar, and
kheer (i.e., satisfied), with sluggishness (i.e., slowness, inactivity) arising
due to a fat body, with terrible intellectual delusion, with stupidity, whose
specific consciousness has been extinguished, like a plant, not relying on the
karma-consciousness of the Muni-Indra out of fear of the bondage of merit, and
not attaining rest in the knowledge-consciousness of ultimate non-action (only)
subject to manifest and unmanifest negligence, with the tendency of the
consciousness of the light (inferior) karmic fruits obtained, which prevails in
them, like a plant, they only bind themselves to sin. It is also said that:
"Those who rely on conviction, but do not know conviction (in reality), are lazy
in external conduct and destroy the results of conduct."  ** (Now, the conduct
of the knowledgeable beings who act according to the ground, with the harmony of
both conviction and conduct, is described.)**  But those who are great souls,
always striving for non-rebirth (liberation), not relying on only one of
conviction and conduct (i.e., not being only dependent on conviction or only
dependent on conduct), being extremely moderate, facing the creation of rest in
the pure consciousness-like self-principle, preventing the rise of negligence,
with the greatness of the transformation of the ritualistic conduct that follows
the rise of negligence, remaining extremely indifferent, as far as possible,
experiencing the self with the self in the self, always remaining appropriate,
they (i.e., those great souls) actually renounce karma gradually according to
the rest in their own nature, remaining extremely free from negligence, being
extremely still, to whom the simile of a plant is given, yet who have completely
eradicated (destroyed) the experience of karmic fruits, remaining indifferent to
the experience of karma, being completely filled with the essential joy arising
from the experience of knowledge, quickly crossing the ocean of the world,
become the enjoyers of the eternal fruits (i.e., the bliss of Nirvana) of the
word-Brahman. || 172 ||

407 This text states that the essence of the Pancastikaya Prabhruta Shastra is
freedom from attachment (Vitaraga). Therefore, since this text shows the path to
liberation (Moksha) as being freedom from attachment, a person who desires
liberation (Ninchudika) should not be attached to anything at all. By being free
from attachment (Vitaraga), he becomes free from attachment (Vitaraga) through
the absence of attachment (Raga). A worthy being (Bhavya) crosses the ocean of
existence (Bhavasagara). For example, since this Shastra shows freedom from
attachment (Vitaraga) as the essence of the explanation of the path to
liberation (Moksha), a worthy being (Bhavya) who desires liberation (Moksha) and
is characterized by the term "Samayasara" which signifies the manifestation of
infinite qualities like perfect knowledge (Kevalgyana) and who is a worthy being
(Arhada) etc., should not be attached to his own perception (Samvitti). By being
free from attachment (Vitaraga) through the light of pure consciousness
(Niruparaga Chijjyoti), he attains liberation (Moksha) which is characterized by
infinite knowledge (Anantgyana) etc., and transcends the ocean of existence
(Samsarasagara) which is ignited by the flames of the tree of suffering
(Vadavanalasikha) and is filled with the salty water of suffering (Ksharanira)
which is the obstacle to the enjoyment of the sweet taste of supreme bliss
(Paramananda) which is the only form of happiness (Sukharasa) and is filled with
the salty water of suffering (Ksharanira) which is the obstacle to the enjoyment
of the sweet taste of supreme bliss (Paramananda) which is the only form of

408 **Index of the Path to Liberation, Chapter, with Commentary**  (Therefore)
because (he is desireless) he who is devoid of desire (in all things) does not
have any (attachment) in any of the objects (he is a worthy being) that worthy
being (for this reason) becomes (freed from attachment) freed from attachment
(and crosses) crosses the ocean of existence.  **Special Meaning:** Because this
scripture, in relation to the explanation of the path to liberation, shows the
path to liberation as the state of being freed from attachment, which is the
light of pure consciousness without any attributes, therefore, the worthy being
who desires liberation, which is worthy of being spoken of in terms of the
essence of time, the manifestation of infinite qualities like perfect knowledge,
etc., does not have any attachment in the form of self-experience even in the
Arhats, etc. - because of this state of pure consciousness, which is free from
attachment and luminous, that being, freed from attachment, crosses the ocean of
existence and attains liberation, which is the form of infinite knowledge and
other qualities. This ocean of existence is the opposite of the eternal and
imperishable, it is filled with various kinds of aquatic beings in the form of
birth, old age, death, etc., it is full of the bitter water of hellish
suffering, which prevents the enjoyment of the one taste of supreme bliss, which
is free from attachment, it is full of the chain of waves of all auspicious and
inauspicious choices, which are the objects of the five senses, which destroy
the supreme concentration, which is free from choices like attachment, etc., and
within which the peak of the great fire of various kinds of mental suffering,
which causes agitation, is burning, instead of the supreme bliss, which is free
from agitation.  In this way, as mentioned earlier, the meaning of this
scripture should be understood as liberation from attachment. That liberation
from attachment is achieved through both the theoretical and practical aspects,
which are mutually dependent on each other - liberation cannot be achieved in
isolation without dependence. The meaning of this is that those who, without any
dependence on the path to liberation, which is the theoretical aspect of pure
knowledge, vision, and the nature of the pure self, which is the nature of the
pure self, only consider the practical aspect of auspicious conduct as the path
to liberation, they, with this understanding, only experience the suffering of
the heavenly realms, etc., and continue to wander in this world through
tradition. But those who believe that the path to liberation is the experience
of the pure self, and when they do not have the power to practice the path to
liberation in theory, then they follow the auspicious conduct, which is the
means of achieving the theoretical aspect, then they are those who have right
vision with attachment, and then they attain liberation through tradition. In
this way, two statements have been made, mainly to refute the isolated aspect of
practice, and those who, taking the theoretical aspect in isolation, do not
attain the benefit of the pure self, which is the supreme concentration, free
from choices like attachment, etc., but still follow the six essential
practices, such as Samayika, etc., which are worthy of the conduct of an
ascetic, and the practice of giving, etc., which is worthy of the conduct of a
lay follower,

The **Pancastikaya** (Five Principles) refutes the **402** practices like
worship, etc. They are corrupted in both **knowledge** and **conduct**, and they
do not know any state other than the state fit for **knowledge** and
**conduct**, thus they bind themselves to **sin**. Those who consider the
**knowledge** of the pure soul as the path to **liberation** and the **conduct**
of the pure soul as the path to **liberation**, are considered to be on the path
to **liberation**. However, due to the rise of **attachment** to **conduct**,
they are not equal to those who follow the pure **conduct** with the expectation
of the feeling of the pure soul from both good and bad **conduct**, even though
they are not able to do so. Nevertheless, such **right-seeing** individuals, who
are engaged in **charity**, **worship**, etc., with **attachment** to **right-
belief**, etc., attain **liberation** through tradition. Thus, by refuting the
**isolation** of **knowledge**, two statements are made, which proves that
**knowledge** and **conduct** are worthy of being considered as **means** and
**ends** to each other. Through this, the **knowledgeable** soul attains
**liberation** only by the power of **supreme meditation** free from
**attachment**, etc. || 172 ||  Thus, the statement is made by **contracting**
the meaning of the **scripture**. In this way, the **verse** is spoken in the
eleventh place, mainly describing the meaning of what was said in five
statements. **The indication of the affirmation of the doer is to be completed.
I have spoken the essence of the discourse, the **Pancastikaya** collection, the
**sutra**, to inspire the **path**, the **effect**, and the **devotion** to the
**discourse**. || 173 || **The essence of the discourse, the **Pancastikaya**
collection, the **sutra**, was spoken by me, inspired by the **devotion** to the
**discourse**, for the purpose of **influencing** the **path**. || 173 || The
**path** is the supreme **command** of the **divine**, which is inclined towards
the making of supreme **detachment**. Its **influence** is the **manifestation**
through **propaganda** or the **raising** through the **excellent** **result**.
For this purpose, the **sutra** is spoken by me, which is the essence of the
**discourse**, which is very extensive, being indicative of all the **truths**
of the **things**, being **moved** by the **heart** **flowing** with the
**supreme** **faith**. This is because it is known to the **omniscient**
**Lord**. Thus, the **author** of the **scripture**, having reached the end of
what was begun, becomes completely **fulfilled** and rests in the pure **form**
of **supreme** **non-action**. || 173 || Thus, the **second** **Shrutakhanda**
ends with the **description** of the **path** to **liberation** with the
**nine** **categories** of **objects** in the **time** **explanation**. || This
**time** **explanation** of the **Pancastikaya** collection is completed with
the **explanation** of the **truths** of the **things** accumulated by one's own
**power**. There is nothing to be done for the **hidden** **form** of the
**immortal** **moon** **sun**. || 8 ||

410 **Mokshamārga Prapancha Sūchika Chūlikā** - Anvayārtha -
(Pravachanabhaktiprachoditenā mayā) Inspired by the devotion of the discourse, I
(Mārga-prabhāvanārtha) for the purpose of influencing the path (Pravachanasāram)
the essence of the discourse (Panchaastikasangrahaṃ Sūtram) the
'Panchaastikayasangraha' sūtra (Bhaṇitam) said. Tīkā - This is the conclusion
indicating the fulfillment of the author's promise. 'Mārga - the supreme
detachment, is the name of the supreme command of the skillful and efficient
Paramēśvari, which is to be illuminated by its influence and proclamation, or by
its excellent culmination, for that purpose ( - for the purpose of influencing
the path), I, who was very agitated in my mind with the speed of attachment from
the side of the supreme āgama, said this sūtra called 'Panchaastikayasangraha' -
which is a 'sūtra' because it was taught by the omniscient Lord (first time
taught), and because it is the proponent of the essence of all things (the true
nature of all things) in brief, it is also the essence of a very extensive
discourse. Mār Śāvakah. Śrīmanatkundakundācāryadeva) having attained the end of
the work begun, being very satisfied, rests ( - remains stable) in the pure form
of supreme non-action, such is our faith (i.e. we have such faith). || 173 ||
_Thus, the second Śrutaskaṇḍha named Mokshamārga Prapanchavarṇana, with the
addition of nine substances, ends in the commentary named Samayavyākhyā. (Now,
Śrī Amṛtacandraācāryadeva concludes the commentary by saying a final verse with
the meaning - 'This commentary has been done by Śabda, not by Amṛtacandrasuri')_
Ślokārtha - Śabda, who has well spoken the essence ( - true nature) of things
with his power, has explained that time ( - explanation of the meaning of time
or the commentary on the Panchaastikayasangrahaśāstra), Amṛtacandrasuri, who is
hidden in form ( - hidden in the form of knowledge only), has no duty in it (8)
Saṃ. Tā. - Ath Śrīkundakundācāryadevaḥ, fulfilling his own promise, concludes
the work, the Panchaastikayasangraha - sūtra. What is special? The essence of
the discourse. For what purpose? For the purpose of influencing the path. Thus -
Mokshamārga is the experience of the pure self, characterized by detachment from
the body, the world, and enjoyment. Its influence is its own experience and the
revelation of it to others. For that purpose, I, the doer, inspired by the
devotion of the supreme āgama, have explained this Panchaastikayasāstra. What is
its characteristic? Because of its brief explanation of the
Panchaastikayashadtravyādi, it is the essence of the discourse of the
Dvādaśāṅga. This is the meaning. || 173 || Thus, the twelve verses are gone, in
the form of the conclusion of the work. Thus, the third Mahādhikāra is
concluded. ||

411 **Pancastikaya Prabhrit** Hindi Ta. - Uththānikā - Further it is said that
Śrīkundakundācāryadeva, fulfilling his promise, concludes the text.  (Anvaya
Sahit Sāmānyārtha) - (Mayā) I, Kundakundācārya, (Pavaṇabhattipracodideṇa)
inspired by the devotion to the Āgama, (Maggappabhāvaṇatuṁ) for the propagation
of Jina Dharma, (Padayaṇasāraṁ) having spoken the essence of the Āgama,
(Pancattthiyasanghaṁ Suttam) the Pancastikaya Sangraha Sutra, (Bhaṇiyaṁ) have
described. **Viśeṣārtha** - The path to liberation is indeed the form of
detachment from the worldly body and enjoyments, or it is the form of pure self-
realization. Its propagation is that one should experience it oneself and
enlighten others. For the propagation of such a path to liberation, I, inspired
by devotion to the Paramāgama, have spoken this scripture called Pancastikaya,
in which the five Astikayas and the six Dravyas etc. have been explained in
brief, illuminating all things. Therefore, this is the essence of the other
twelve-limbed Āgama.  173.  Thus, concluding the text, the verse is spoken in
the twelfth place. Here, the third Mahādhikāra is complete.  Saṁ. Ta. - Ath

## Translation:  412 The eight limbs of yoga, namely, **Mokshamarga**,
**Prapancha**, **Suchika**, **Chulika**, **Yada**, **Yatha**, **Iti**, and
**Ashtaanga**, are the means of achieving liberation. A concise explanation of
these is given in the **Tattvanushaasanadhyaana** text as follows: "When the
mind, senses, and object of meditation are still, one-pointed concentration is
called **dhyana**. The fruit of **dhyana** is the destruction of **samvara** and
**nirjara."  There are three types of meditators and meditations, namely,
**jghanya**, **madhyama**, and **utkrista**, as explained in the
**Tattvanushaasanadhyaana** text. This is also evident from the term **tiyo**
(third) in the **Maaranekala** text, which refers to the **dhyanasamgri**
(materials of meditation) as being of three types: **jghanya**, **madhyama**,
and **utkrista**.  Alternatively, in a very concise way, there are two types of
meditators: those who begin with **shuddhaatmabhavana** (meditation on the pure
self) are called **prarambhayogi** (beginner yogis) and those who attain the
**nirvikalpa** (without modifications) **shuddhaatma** (pure self) state are
called **nishpannayogi** (accomplished yogis).  In the language of **adhyatma**
(spiritual knowledge), the meditator, meditation, and object of meditation are
to be understood as **samvaranirjara** (destruction of **samvara** and
**nirjara**), **sadhakara** (means of achieving liberation), and
**vikalparahita** (without modifications), respectively. The fruits of
meditation are sevenfold: **paramananda** (supreme bliss), **ekalakshanasukha**
(bliss characterized by oneness), **vridhi** (increase),
**nirvikarasvasamvedana** (awareness of the self without modifications),
**jnaanavridhi** (increase in knowledge), **buddhi** (intellect), and
**saptathir** (sevenfold).  Furthermore, the characteristics of the meditator
mentioned elsewhere, as described by teachers and those who have completed their
practice, are to be considered as included here.  Now, the stages of a
**ghatakala** (one who destroys the karmas) are explained in the language of
**agama** (Jain scriptures). When someone, with the intention of practicing the
fourfold **radhana** (spiritual practices), becomes free from the **acharya**
(spiritual teacher) and **parigraha** (attachment), and receives **jindiksha**
(initiation into Jainism), then after initiation, they receive instruction in
the **achara** (conduct), **radhana** (spiritual practices), **charana**
(conduct), **karan** (action), and **grantha** (scriptures) to understand the
fourfold **radhana**. After receiving this instruction, they practice the
**charana** and **karan** as explained in the scriptures, and with the help of
**vyakhyana** (explanation), they nurture their **shiष्यगण** (group of
disciples) with **panchabhavana** (five types of meditation). This is called the
**ganaposhanakala** (stage of nurturing disciples).  The five types of
**bhavana** (meditation) are: **tapobhavana** (meditation on austerity),
**shrutabhavana** (meditation on scriptures), **sattvabhavana** (meditation on
virtue), **ekatvabhavana** (meditation on oneness), and **santoshabhavana**
(meditation on contentment).  **Tapobhavana** is the practice of twelve types of
austerities, including **anashana** (fasting). Its fruit is the conquest of
**kṣaya** (passions) and **viṣaya** (objects of sense).  **Shrutabhavana** is of
four types: **prathamaniyoga** (study of the first **niyoga**),
**charananiyoga** (study of the **charana**), **karananiyoga** (study of the
**karan**), and **dravyaniyoga** (study of the **dravya**). **Prathamaniyoga**
is the study of the **trishatshashtilaka** (63 **shalaka**), **purusha** (soul),
and **purana** (ancient history). **Charananioga** is the study of the
**upasaka** (lay follower), **adhyayana** (study), **charara** (conduct),
**radhana** (spiritual practices), and other scriptures, as well as the
**deshacharitra** (conduct of the land) and **sakalacharitra** (complete
conduct). **Karananiyoga** is the study of the **jinantara** (other
**tirthankaras**), **triloka** (three worlds), **saraloka** (all worlds),
**vibhagaloka** (division of worlds), **lokaniyoga** (allocation of worlds), and
other scriptures. **Dravyaniyoga** is the study of the **praabhrutattva**
(fundamental principles), **arthasiddhanta** (philosophy of reality), and other
scriptures, as well as the **jiva** (soul), **dravya** (substance), and other
topics. The fruit of **shrutabhavana** is the removal of doubt, delusion, and
confusion regarding the **jiva** and other **tattva** (principles), or the
knowledge of **heyopadeya** (what is to be abandoned and what is to be
accepted).  It is said: "The **samvara** (restraint) of the **bhavana**
(meditation) that is for the benefit of the self, the ninefold **samvega**
(spiritual enthusiasm), **ni:kampata** (steadiness), **tapobhavana** (meditation
on austerity), and the teaching of others are the fruits of **shrutabhavana**."
**Sattvabhavana** is the practice of **mulottaraguna** (virtues) and other
**anushtana** (practices), and its fruit is the ability to achieve liberation
even in the face of severe **upasarga** (obstacles) and **parishaha**
(hardships), as exemplified by the **Pandavas**.  **Ekatvabhavana** is the
meditation on oneness, as expressed in the following verse: "My self is one,
characterized by **nana** (knowledge) and **darshana** (vision). All other
things are external, characterized by **sanjoga** (association)." The fruit of
**ekatvabhavana** is the removal of delusion regarding oneself, others, and
everything else.  It is said: "Just as a wise person, seeing their

## The Fivefold Body and the Six Stages of Time  **The Fivefold Body
(Panchaastikaya) and the Six Stages of Time (Shatkala) are not applicable to the
413 (referring to a specific text or section).**  **The meaning here is:** "From
the beginning, the middle, and the end, the knowledge, the conduct, and the
fivefold body, the beginning, the middle, and the end, the restraint, the yoga,"
and so on.  **Where the explanation is in accordance with the three jewels of
non-duality (Abhedaratnatraya) as explained in the essence of the scriptures
(Agamasara), that is called Adhyatma Shastra (spiritual science).** The six
stages of time are explained briefly in relation to this.  **Where the three
jewels of non-duality, the nature of the six substances (Shatdravya), right
faith (Samyak Shraddha), and the different types of vows (Navrata) are
explained, that is called Agama Shastra (scriptural science).** This is the
external means of achieving the internal practice of the three jewels of non-
duality. The six stages of time are also explained briefly in relation to this.
**Specifically, the detailed explanation of both should be understood from other
texts according to the order explained by the previous teachers.**  **This is
the summary of the commentary (Tatparyavritti) by Acharya Jayasena.**  **First,
the first major section (Mahaadhikari) is called "Panchaastikaya Shatdravya
Praatipadaka" (Explaining the Fivefold Body and the Six Substances), which
consists of 111 verses and eight sub-sections (Antaradhikari).**  **Then, the
second major section is called "Navapadarth Praatipadaka" (Explaining the Nine
Categories of Objects), which consists of 50 verses and ten sub-sections.**
**Then, the third major section is called "Aashthala Ikshiswaroop Mokshamarg
Praatipadaka" (Explaining the Eight Stages, the Nature of the Seer, and the Path
to Liberation), which consists of 20 verses.**  **Thus, the Fivefold Body
(Panchaastikaya) is completed with a total of 181 verses in three major
sections.**  **This commentary (Tatparyavritti) on the Fivefold Body
(Panchaastikaya) is completed on the 1st day of the bright fortnight of Ashwin,
Vikram Samvat 1369 (corresponding to October 13, 1412 CE).**  **Now, the
commentator says that this summary of the Fivefold Body (Panchaastikaya) is
explained for the benefit of the interested student (Ruchidhari Shishya).**
**At the time of receiving education, one is called a student (Shishya).**
Therefore, to explain the characteristics of a student, the different stages of
initiation or education of those who worship the Supreme Soul (Paramatma) are
explained.  **There are six stages of time (Shatkala):**  1. **Deekshakal
(Initiation Stage):** When a near-liberated soul (Bhavyajiva) who has attained
the three jewels of certainty (Nishchay) and conduct (Vyavahar) approaches the
Acharya (teacher) and renounces external and internal possessions to receive
Jain initiation, this is the initiation stage.  2. **Shikshakala (Education
Stage):** After initiation, when one receives education in the scriptures
(Adhyatma Shastra) to gain deeper knowledge of the three jewels of certainty and
conduct, as well as the nature of the Supreme Soul (Paramatma), this is the
education stage.  3. **Ganpooshanakala (Nourishing the Group Stage):** After
education, when one remains steadfast in the path of liberation (Mokshamarg) and
nourishes the near-liberated souls (Bhavyaprana) who are seeking the path of
liberation by teaching them the truth of the Supreme Soul (Paramatma), this is
the nourishing the group stage.  4. **Atmasanskarkala (Self-Refinement Stage):**
After nourishing the group, when one renounces their group (Gan) or community
(Sangha) and refines their own nature (Atmaswabhav) by dwelling in their true
nature, this is the self-refinement stage.

##  Chapter 424: The Path to Liberation - A Detailed Explanation  **5.
Sallekhana:** After self-purification, Sallekhana is a state of being where one
dwells in the state of the Supreme Soul, free from passions like anger and
possessing infinite knowledge and other qualities. It involves a gradual
reduction of attachments and desires.  **Kayaklesha Sallekhana** involves
intentionally causing physical discomfort and emaciation. The period during
which these practices are undertaken is known as the **Sallekhana period**.
**6. Uttamārtha Kāla:** After Sallekhana, the practice of **Tapascharya**
(austerity) involves four aspects:  * **Shraddhā** (faith) in the true nature of
the soul as pure knowledge and perception. * **Jnāna** (knowledge) of the soul's
true nature. * **Āchār** (conduct) aligned with this knowledge. * **Nirodha**
(restraint) of desires for external objects.  This practice is undertaken for
liberation in the current life for those who are **Charamashariri** (those who
are destined to attain liberation in this life). For those who are not
Charamashariri, it helps them attain the necessary qualifications for liberation
in a future life. This period is known as **Uttamārtha Kāla**.  These six
periods (**Sallekhana Kāla** and **Uttamārtha Kāla**) are not necessarily
experienced sequentially. Some may attain **Kevalajnāna** (perfect knowledge)
during the first period, others during the second, and so on.  **Dhyāna
(Meditation):**  There are eight aspects of meditation:  * **Dhyātā** (the
meditator) * **Dhyāna** (the act of meditation) * **Phalam** (the fruit of
meditation) * **Dhyeyam** (the object of meditation) * **Yatra** (where to
meditate) * **Yasyam** (when to meditate) * **Yathā** (how to meditate) *
**Āsana** (the posture)  **A concise explanation:**  * **Dhyātā** is one who
controls their senses and mind. * **Dhyeyam** is the true nature of reality. *
**Dhyāna** is focused contemplation. * **Phalam** is the attainment of
**Samvara** (control over passions) and **Nirjara** (elimination of karmic
impurities).  This is explained in detail in the text **Tattvanushasan** which
also describes three types of **Dhyātā** and three types of **Dhyāna** based on
the quality of the meditator. This is due to the fact that the materials of
meditation (**dravya**, **kshetra**, **kāla**, **bhāva**) are also of three
types.  **Two types of meditators:**  * **Prarabdha Yogi:** Those who are in the
initial stages of meditation, with subtle **vikalpa** (fluctuations of mind). *
**Nishpanna Yogi:** Those who have attained a state of pure consciousness, free
from **vikalpa**.  In summary, one should understand the **Dhyātā**, **Dhyāna**,
**Dhyeyam**, and **Phalam** of meditation in the language of spirituality. The
fruit of meditation is the attainment of **Samvara** and **Nirjara**, leading to
the growth of **paramānanda** (supreme bliss) free from passions and
fluctuations.

415 Panchalika is the attainment of the knowledge of the five types of
liberation, which is free from the cycle of birth and death and is free from
change, and the attainment of the seven types of supernatural powers, such as
intellect. _Other texts also describe three types of meditators. For example,
the disciple, the beginner, the practitioner, and the accomplished yogi. Their
description should also be understood as being included in this statement as
much as possible. Now, according to the language of the Agamas, there are six
periods of time_ 1- When someone, in the presence of the four types of right
faith, knowledge, conduct, and penance, goes to an Acharya who is the guardian
of the five vows, and renounces internal and external possessions, and takes the
Jain initiation, that is the period of initiation. 2- After initiation, when one
learns from the scriptures that are helpful for the practice of the four types
of penance and for the practice of conduct, that is the period of education. 3-
After education, when one nourishes the disciples by practicing the teachings
that are helpful for conduct, and by explaining them, with the five types of
contemplation, that is the period of nourishing the community. There are five
types of contemplation: penance, scripture, character, unity, and contentment.
1- To perform the twelve types of pure penance, such as fasting, is the
contemplation of penance. The fruit of this contemplation is victory over the
senses and passions. 2- To study the four types of Agamas, namely, the
Pratyamanuyoga, the Charanamanuyoga, the Karanamanuyoga, and the Dravyamanuyoga,
is the contemplation of scripture. The explanation of the Puranas of the thirty-
six types of men is the Pratyamanuyoga. The explanation of the conduct of the
country and the conduct of all beings through the scriptures of the study of the
object of worship and the practice of conduct is called the Charanamanuyoga. The
explanation of the world through the Jinantar, the Trilokasar, the division of
the world, etc., is the Karanamanuyoga. The explanation of the six substances,
such as the soul, and the seven principles, through the Prabhrit, i.e., the
Samayaprabhrit, etc., and the Tattvarthasutra, etc., is the Dravyamanuyoga. The
fruit of the contemplation of this scripture is that there is a firm conclusion
without doubt, delusion, or confusion regarding the relationship of the soul and
other principles, or regarding the principle that is to be abandoned or the
principle that is to be attained. The fruit of the contemplation of this
scripture is said in other texts: "The contemplation of penance, which is for
the benefit of the self, is a new and fresh impulse. The contemplation of
penance is the teaching of the other, the knowledge of the other."

## The Path to Liberation: A Guide to Jain Principles  **Index of Concepts and
Their Meanings**  **1. Understanding the Scriptures:** A person who understands
the scriptures gains six benefits:  (1) **Faith in Self-Benefit:**  They develop
strong faith in the benefits of following the path. (2) **Control of Inflows:**
They control the influx of karmic matter. (3) **Growth in Dharma:** They
continuously grow in their adherence to the principles of Dharma. (4)
**Effortless Results:** They achieve their goals effortlessly. (5) **Desire for
Austerity:** They develop a strong desire to practice austerities. (6) **Ability
to Teach Others:** They become capable of teaching others.  **2. Fearless
Conduct:**  Fearless conduct in upholding the fundamental and secondary virtues
is known as **Sattva-Bhavana**. This leads to unwavering courage and enthusiasm
in pursuing liberation, even in the face of severe hardships and trials, like
the Pandavas.  **3. Oneness with the Soul:**  Recognizing the soul as a
singular, eternal entity, characterized by knowledge and perception, is
**Ekatva-Bhavana**. As stated in the scripture:  "My soul is one, alone,
imperishable, possessing the qualities of knowledge and perception. All other
experiences, arising from external connections, are external to me."  This leads
to detachment from both loved ones and strangers, as stated:  "Just as a wise
person, possessing Ekatva-Bhavana, does not become attached even when witnessing
the mockery of his sister, so too, a Jina-follower does not become attached."
**4. Contentment:**  Maintaining equanimity in the face of praise and blame, and
finding contentment in whatever benefits one receives, such as food and drink,
is **Santasha-Bhavana**. This leads to liberation from the cycle of birth and
death, as it allows one to experience the supreme bliss of the soul, free from
the attachments of worldly pleasures.  **5. Self-Transformation:**  A person who
desires to transform their soul through the practice of **Gana-Poshana**
(nurturing the community) may leave their current group and join another group
or monastic order. This is known as **Atma-Sanskara-Kala** (the time of self-
transformation).  **6. Self-Discipline:**  During **Atma-Sanskara-Kala**, one
practices self-discipline through adherence to the principles outlined in the
scriptures, including the practice of **Sallekhana** (voluntary fasting unto
death). This is known as **Sallekhana-Kala** (the time of self-discipline).
**7. Ultimate Goal:**  After **Sallekhana**, one completes the final stage of
their journey through meditation and other practices, guided by the four types
of **Aradhana** (worship). This is known as **Uttam-Artha-Kala** (the time of
the ultimate goal).

The five astikayas, starting with the first, attain four types of worship in the
beginning itself. There is no rule of six times. Here, the meaning is that the
scripture which explains the essence of the Agamas, taking the evidence of the
verses written below, in accordance with the feelings of the three jewels, with
words and meanings, is called Adhyatma Shastra.  "My soul is in my knowledge, my
soul is in my vision, my soul is in my conduct. My soul is in my renunciation,
my soul is in my detachment, my soul is in my yoga."  - This means that wherever
the soul is, all these things are there.  The description of the six times,
based on the Adhyatma Shastra, has already been done briefly.  The scripture
which describes the nature of the three jewels, in the form of faith, knowledge,
and conduct, of the six substances, etc., spoken by the omniscient, free from
passions, is called Agama Shastra.  This statement is the external means of
spiritual conduct based on the three jewels.  The six times are also mentioned
briefly based on this.  If you want to know more, it is worth knowing the
explanation of the six times, in both Agama and Adhyatma forms, from other
scriptures, according to the order spoken by the previous Acharyas.  In this
way, the first Maha Adhikar, which speaks of the five astikayas and six
substances, through eight internal chapters, in one hundred and eleven verses,
is called Tatparya Vritti, written by Shri Jayasenacharya.  After that, the
second Maha Adhikar, which speaks of nine substances, through ten internal
chapters, in fifty verses, is called.  Then, the third Maha Adhikar, which
speaks of the nature of liberation and the path to liberation, through twelve
locations, in twenty verses, is called.  In this way, the five astikayas,
starting with the first, are completed in one hundred and eighty-one verses, in
three chapters.  There are 173 verses in the time explanation.
