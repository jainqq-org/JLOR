Padmapurana Acharya Ravishena [First Part]  || The entire secret of the path of
knowledge and liberation is revealed. The divine Kanya (Goddess) Vasu, the
destroyer of the enemy, is worshipped. || 73 || Thus ends the twelve names of
the Acharya Vishnu. || 12 ||  Then, crossing over, the highly respected ones,
distressed by the sweet and bitter experiences, preceded by thousands of
followers, approached the abode of Prabhavana. They stayed there as per their
liking. || 2 ||  (There) the thousands of weeping ones, whose faces were not
anointed, showed their inability. But the mother (Goddess) did not accept it.
Quickly she became pleased. || 4 ||  On being told this by the mouths of the
Lokapalas (guardians of the world), they were amazed! The Lokapalas laughed
heartily and said, "We shall release you from this bondage. ||   For whom the
lord of the gods, the pure one, free from thorns, has come from the city of the
gods, how can this worldly lord obstruct him? Filled with reverence, they said,
"We shall release you from this, for there is no other way." || 11 ||  Seeing
this, the Lokpala did not do anything. || 12 ||  Then, being humble, he said to
the cycle of transmigration, "Here the imperishable, nectar-like letters are not
more than that. How can the violation of the command be?" || 14 ||  "If the
gurus are not in the ultimate truth, then the one who is worthy of worship gives
me a seat. The ninefold vows are not to be abandoned. || 16 ||  My mind is
distressed. Who is my fourth born now? The best among the brothers, the best
among the brothers, the best among the brothers." || 20 ||  The Lokapalas were
just as they were before. "Is there anything more than this in your
discernment?" || 21 ||  "Let this one be tired in Varanasi, where the land is
made sacred." Then the sweet words came out. "Certainly, the birth is new. The
best among the devotees, may your desire be fulfilled. Not at all, there is no
defect in you. Equal to the capable one. The one who creates fame, the two
faults, the two faults, what is your choice?" || 22 ||  But the birth on the
earth cannot be abandoned with pride. A

In the Jain tradition, Maryadapurushotam Ram is considered one of the 63 Shalaka
Purushas. One of his names was also Padma. This name is more prevalent in Jain
Puranas and Charitakavyas. Jain poets have presented Ram's character in various
languages like Prakrit, Sanskrit, Apabhramsha, etc., under names like
Paumachariyam, Paumachariyu, Padma Purana, Padmacharit, etc. Acharya Ravishena's
(7th century) present work, Padma Purana, is considered one of the most
excellent character-based epics in Sanskrit. Even though it is a Purana, this
work is so extraordinary in terms of poetic art, psychoanalysis, character
portrayal, etc., that it cannot be compared to any other Purana Kavya. The
poetic beauty in it is so profound that this poetic stream, emanating from the
mental snow-capped mountains as the poet's inner voice, seems to be the
Mandakini itself. From the perspective of subject matter, the poet has depicted
the Vidhyadharaloka, Anjana-Pavananjay, Hanuman, Sukoshal, etc., along with the
main plot, which has increased the interest of the work so much that one does
not feel like stopping after starting to read it once. Edited by Purana-paragami
Dr. (Pan.) Pannalal Jain Sahityacharya with a preface, appendix, etc., and
translated into Hindi, this work has been published in three volumes by
Bharatiya Gyanpith. This is another new edition of the work, keeping in mind the
expectation and need of scholars, researchers, and self-study enthusiasts.

## Editorial [First Edition]  The Ramayana has been the most ancient, extensive,
revered, and interesting subject in Indian literature. If we measure ancient
Sanskrit and Prakrit literature from this perspective, then perhaps more than
half of it will be found to be connected, originated, or inspired by this story
in some form. In the Vedic tradition, the Valmiki Ramayana is considered the
oldest epic. The most excellent epic of that tradition is Kalidasa's
'Raghuvamsa', whose subject is the same Rama story. And the two excellent plays
of the great poet Bhavabhuti, 'Mahavira Charita' and 'Uttara-Ramacharita', are
also entirely based on the Ramayana. Although this story is not found to be as
extensive in the Buddhist tradition, it is narrated in the famous 'Jataka'
section of Pali literature, called 'Dasaratha Jataka'. And in it, Lord Buddha
himself is considered to be Rama Pandit in a previous birth. This story is
concise and unique in its own way in some aspects. Its greatest peculiarity is
considering both Rama and Sita as brother and sister, and their marriage after
returning from exile. In the Shakya dynasty, from which Lord Buddha was born,
there are mentions of the practice of brother-sister marriage. This story was
also very popular among the mixed Semitic races. According to Jain Puranas, the
marriage of brother and sister in the Bhoga-bhumis has been a stable system.  In
the Jain tradition, Rama is counted among the sixty-three Shalaka-purushas as
Vasudeva, and great Puranas have been written about his life story. Rama's name
was also Padma, and this name is more commonly used for him in Jain Puranas.
The oldest Jain Purana related to the Ramayana is the Padma Purana written in
Sanskrit by Ravishena, the Pauma-Chariya written in Prakrit by Vimalsuri, and
the 'Pauma-Chariu' written in Apabhramsha by Swayambhu. This character is also
found in the Sanskrit Mahapurana by Jinasena Gunabhadra, the Apabhramsha
Mahapurana by Pushpadanta, and the Sanskrit Trishatishataka Shalaka Purusha
Charita by Hemachandra. From the perspective of the similarity and dissimilarity
of the story, we can divide this literature into two categories. One category
includes the works of Vimalsuri, Ravishena, Swayambhu, and Hemachandra, and the
other category includes the works of Gunabhadra and Pushpadanta. The biggest
peculiarity of the works of this second category compared to the first is that
they consider Rama's father Dasharatha to be the king of Banaras and describe
Sita as born from the womb of Mandodari, the queen of Ravana. Why this
difference in belief arose is a subject of study.  Regarding the two oldest and
greatest works related to the Ramayana, the Padma Purana written in Sanskrit by
Ravishenacharya and the Paumachariyam written in Prakrit by Vimalsuri, many
thought-provoking points arise. The plot of both is entirely the same. Not only
this, but by looking at both together, there is no doubt that they are merely
linguistic adaptations of each other. Who translated whose work could be known
from their chronological order of composition. But a difficulty has arisen in
this matter. Ravishena completed his work in 733 CE. This is mentioned in the
text itself, and no one doubts it. But the date of completion of his work, 60
CE, mentioned by Vimalsuri, has been accepted by Dr. Winternitz, but many other
scholars are not willing to accept it. German scholar Dr. Hermann Jacobi, who
first edited this text, expressed his doubt that the form of Prakrit language
that appears in this text and the use of certain special words in it, suggests
that this work is not from the first century CE but from the third or fourth
century CE. According to Dr. Wulner, this text indicates the Apabhramsha period
due to its word formation. Pandit Keshalal Dhruva has studied the various meters
used in this text, which also supports Dr. Wulner's opinion.

##  English Translation:  6 Padma Purana bows to the opinion. The implication is
that there is doubt and controversy regarding the time of composition of the
Prakrit Paumachari. It is only certain that Udyotan Suri, in his work called
Kuvalayamala, which he completed in Saka Samvat 700, Vikrama Samvat 835,
mentions both Ravishena's work and Paumachari. Therefore, it can be said with
certainty that Paumachari was composed before Vikrama Samvat 835.  This
chronological information leaves the precedence of the Padma Purana and
Paumachari undecided. Therefore, it cannot be said with certainty who translated
whose work. Pandit Nathuramji Premi had some thoughts on this in an article
titled "Padmacharit and Paumachari" published in 1942 in Anekant, year 5, Kiran
1-2, and later in his "Jain Literature and History" [First Edition 1942, Second
Edition 1956]. The editor of the present work has mentioned the important points
that Premiji has made on this subject in his introduction. But the important
discussion that Premiji has made in his article, which sheds some light on the
precedence of the two works, has been completely forgotten here. In short,
Premiji has pointed out three things. One is that there are many examples in
ancient Jain literature of translations from Prakrit to Sanskrit, but there are
no examples of translations from Sanskrit to Prakrit on such a large scale.
Secondly, the Paumachari is concise, while the Padma Purana is detailed. And
thirdly, the story of the origin of the 'Man' [Brahmin] found in Ravishena's
Padma Purana [4, 122] suggests its Prakrit source, because the word 'Mahan' is
Prakrit and its etymology can only be understood from the Prakrit expression
'Mahan' mat marose, as found in the Prakrit Paumachari. The word 'Mahan' is not
accepted in Sanskrit, nor is there any use of this word in the Ravishena sect or
tradition. On the contrary, this word is used extensively in Prakrit Jain Agam
texts. This leads us to believe that Ravishenacharya has retained it as it is in
Sanskrit based on the Paumachari. This subject is not to be overlooked, but
deserves special attention and further study.  1 One aspect of the comparative
study of the two works is that while Ravishena's work is entirely Digambara
tradition, what is the sectarian arrangement of Vimalsuri's Paumachari? Some
scholars have studied the Paumachari from this perspective. As a result, there
are some things in the text that are in line with the Digambara tradition, some
with the Svetambara tradition, and some that are contrary to both, possibly
pointing to a third tradition. These have been mentioned in the introduction.
In addition to these, the new points that have come to our attention are as
follows:  1. In Paumachari 2,22, Lord Mahavira is said to have come from the
womb of Trisaladevi. As follows:  Tassa ya bahugunakaliya bhajja tisallatti
ruva-sampanna. Tie gabbhammi jino ayaao charim-samayami. || 2,22  This is
completely in line with the Digambara tradition, but only partially agrees with
the Svetambara tradition, as there is also mention of the Lord coming from the
womb of Devananda.  2. In Paumachari 2,36-37, it is said that after Lord
Mahavira attained Kevalgyan, he preached and wandered to the Vipulachal
mountain. As follows:  Evam so muni-vasaho atta-maha-padihere parierio. Viharai
jinid bhanu bohinto bhavia-kamalai. || Aya-vihui sahio gana ganaharasyala-sangha
parierio. Viharanto cichay patto viul-giridam mahaviro. || 2,36-37

## Editorial  This point is in accordance with the Svetambara belief and against
the Digambara belief, because here it is believed that only after the knowledge
arose, the Lord came to Mount Vipulachal after staying silent for sixty-six days
and it was here that his first sermon took place.  In Paumachari 3,62, there is
a mention of the dreams of Rishabhdev's mother, Marudevi, before his birth.
Here, the number of dreams has been counted as fifteen by Premji and the editor
of the present book, which they have said is different from both the Svetambara
and Digambara beliefs. But in reality, this is not the case. The incident of the
dreams of the mother of Jin Bhagwan is mentioned in another place in the book
where the birth of Tirthankara Muni Suvrata Nath is described. Ram is considered
to have been in his Tirthankal. The mention of these dreams is as follows:
"Ahasa Suhan Patta Rayanie Pachchhimmammi Jamasmi. Pechchai Chaudas Sumine
Pasath-Jogen Kallani." (21, 12)  "Gay-Vasaha Siha - Abhisheya-Dam-Sasi Dinayaram
Jhayam Kumbham. Pauma-Sar-Sagar - Viman Bhavan Rayanuchchay- Simhin Cha." (21,
13)  Here, the author himself has said that the mother had fourteen dreams,
which he has also counted. If there is any difference between these and
Marudevi's dreams, it is only that what is called 'Abhisheka Dam' here is
mentioned as 'Varshiri-Dam' there. The aforementioned scholars have considered
this as two separate dreams, Lakshmi and a garland of flowers, and thus counted
the number of dreams as fifteen. But from the mention of the dreams at the time
of the birth of Muni Suvrata Nath, it becomes clear that 'Varshri-Dam' and
'Abhisheka-Dam' are both indicative of the same beautiful or auspicious garland,
thus proving the number of dreams to be fourteen. The verse in Paumachari 21,
13, which counts the dreams, is exactly the same as the one found in 'Chhathe
Shrutaang Naya-Dhammakhao' (1, 1). When we compare these dreams with the dreams
mentioned in the Padma Purana (3,124-139), the order of the dreams is exactly
the same, and the places where there is a difference in number and names are,
firstly, the one with 'Varshri-Dam', where Sri Lakshmi and garlands of flowers
are considered as two separate dreams. Secondly, where 'Jhayam' (flag) is
mentioned, 'Matsya' (fish) is found, which indicates a difference in reading or
error in 'Jhas' (fish) and 'Jhay' (flag). And 'Simhasan' (throne) has been added
between 'Sagar' (ocean) and 'Viman' (aircraft). It seems to us that the
difference in the names and number of dreams is similar to the difference in the
number of heavens, 12 and 16, which was once considered to be indicative of
sectarian differences, but now, since both are mentioned together in
Tiloayapanatti, it is not considered to be indicative of sectarian differences.
This matter needs to be considered.  Regarding the sect of the author of
Paumachari, Premji's point is also worth noting that an ancient commentator
called the Apabhramsha poet Svayambhu, who followed this story, as belonging to
the Yapuliya (Yapaniya) sect. It is not surprising that Vimalsuri belongs to the
same tradition. It should be kept in mind that the Yapaniya sect was almost
completely merged into the Digambara sect, and this is proven by inscriptions.
The effort made by Pandit Pannalalji Sahityacharya in preparing this edition of
the Padma Purana with translation is commendable. We especially congratulate the
President of Gyanpeeth, Smt. Rmaraniji, for the rapid pace at which this ancient
literature is being published in a beautiful manner by Gyanpeeth. We also thank
the Minister, Director, and other workers of Gyanpeeth from the bottom of our
hearts for their dedication.  Heeralal Jain A. Ne, Upadhye Granthamala Editor

## Editorial [Second Edition]  The first part of the 'Padma Purana' was
published eighteen years ago in 1958. At that time, its editorial was written by
Dr. Hiralal Jain and Dr. A.N. Upadhye. Both of them have now passed away.
Therefore, I have had to bear their burden.  The thought-provoking points they
raised in their editorial regarding the Sanskrit 'Padma Purana' and the Prakrit
'Paumachariy' are still relevant today. At that time, we had aligned the first
two Parvas of the 'Padma Purana' with the Prakrit 'Paumachariy', marking the
verse numbers of the 'Paumachariy' in our copy of the 'Padma Purana'. That is
still before us. The verses from number 32 to 89 of the first Parva of the
'Paumachariy' are present in the first Parva of the 'Padma Purana' from verse
numbers 43 to 101. There is only a difference of two. The transformation of
verses 44 and 47 of the 'Padma Purana' is not present in the 'Paumachariy'. Such
uniformity cannot happen without following. Some minor changes are also seen. In
the 'Paumachariy', verse number 51 has the word 'Munivarena'. In the 'Padma
Purana', in its place, it is "Digambarena".  In the second Parva, during the
description of Lord Mahavira's birth ceremony, it is mentioned that at the time
of the ceremony on Mount Meru, the child shook Meru with his big toe. Such a
description is not found elsewhere in the Digambar tradition's literature. In
the Svetambar literature, twenty reasons for the bondage of the Tirthankara
nature are considered. Accordingly, twenty numbers are also specified in the
'Paumachariy', but in the 'Padma Purana', sixteen reasons are mentioned
according to the Digambar belief. A comparative study of both reveals other such
points that are thought-provoking.  The influence of Samantabhadra's works is
also sometimes visible. For example, when reading verse 92 in the 14th Parva,
the verse of Samantabhadra's 'Swayambhustotra', 'Doshaya Nallam Kanika Vishaya',
etc., comes to mind, and the 60th verse of this same Parva reminds one of
'Ratnakaranda Shravakachar's 'Kshitigatamiva Vatabijam'. In this fourteenth
Parva, the Muni Raj gives Dharma Upadesh to Ravana when he asks, and in it, so
much emphasis is given on the abandonment of alcohol, meat, honey, and night
meals that such emphasis is not seen elsewhere. Perhaps the reason for this is
that elsewhere, demons are called nocturnal. However,  The story of Rama is
found everywhere in an interesting form. The moral teachings that the
storyteller has given to the people in this interesting form are invaluable for
humanity.  Today, there is a discussion among scholars about whether the
Ramayana is a true event? And there are various speculations on this. Scholars
are entangled in discussions, but ordinary men and women, all inspired by the
pure life of Rama and Sita, make their lives meaningful. Rama, a son and husband
like him, and Sita, a devoted wife like her, are symbols of India's bright
ideals. As long as the spotless ideal of Rama and Sita lives in India, Ravanas,
the slayers of women, cannot be respected in this country.  The President of the
Bharatiya Gyanapith, Smt. Ramarani, was a daughter of that same Sati Sita - a
shining symbol of Indian womanhood. The effect of the cycle of time, that she
too, like Sita, became a resident of heaven and left her husband, Sah Shanti
Prasadji, like Rama, alone. We remember her with great respect. Her dedication
to the upliftment of Indian literature is unforgettable. Now, Sahuji has taken
on her burden, so there is hope and faith that the publication work of the
Mootidevi Granthamala will continue to flourish. The Minister of the Gyanapith,
Ba. Lakshmichandraji, is constantly striving for it as before.  - Kailashchandra

## Editorial (Second Edition)  Sri Ravishenacharya, by composing the Padma
Purana, has greatly benefited all beings. The eighth Balabhadra, Sri
Ramachandraji, was known as Padma. This text is known as Padmacharit or Padma
Purana after him. Ramachandraji's brother Lakshmana, the ruler of the three
divisions of Bharat Kshetra, was the eighth Narayana. The love between Narayana
and Balabhadra is world-renowned. These great souls, born in Ayodhya, adorned
the land of India in the Tirtha of Bhagwan Manisuvratnath. Even after a long
time, they are worthy of reverence for every Indian.  Ramachandraji's life is
filled with extraordinary events. He is worshipped as Maryadapurushotam. He was
completely obedient to his father, King Dasharatha. Upon receiving the order of
fourteen years of exile, he went to the forest without any protest. He
considered exile to be the best course of action, believing that Bharat's
kingdom would not prosper while he was alive. The devoted wife Sita and
Lakshmana, filled with brotherly love, were his companions in exile. The Padma
Purana clearly shows how many destitute kings he protected during his exile.
Lakshmana was the embodiment of brotherly love, while Sita was the epitome of
the natural adornment of the Indian woman, the virtue of Pativrata Dharma.
Ravana, the king of Lanka, abducted Sita from Dandaka Van. To retrieve her,
Ramachandraji waged a righteous war against Ravana. In this righteous war,
Ravana's younger brother Vibhishana, the prominent Sugriva of the Vanarvansha,
Hanuman, and the Vidhyadharas like Viradhit, all provided full support. The
victory achieved by Rama-Lakshmana, who were earthbound, over the celestial
Vidhyadharas, is a testament to their extraordinary inner strength.  After
Ravana's death, Ramachandraji treated his family with affection. He declared
that he had to fight Ravana only to oppose injustice. After the war ended, the
comfort he provided to Ravana's widowed queens and Vibhishana, who was
overwhelmed by the loss of his brother, reveals his noble nature.  He was a
staunch advocate of the happiness of the people and the protection of justice.
This is why, when some people presented the argument of Avarnavada, he had the
pregnant Sita abandoned in a terrifying forest. One should understand that
Sita's Panyoday means that even in that desolate forest, she was provided with
means of protection. He did not hesitate even for a moment to abandon the same
Sita for whom he had fought a terrible war against Ravana, driven by the
sentiment of the people's happiness.  Among the Purana texts, the Padma Purana,
composed by Ravishenacharya, holds a prominent place. It is read with great
devotion by people of all ages. The Hindu society also has a natural reverence
for the Ramakatha. There is hardly any temple where a copy of the Padma Purana
is not found.  The first edition of the Padma Purana, edited by me, was
published by the Bharatiya Gyanpeeth in 1958. [2]

10 Padma Purana It was cold. But now this second edition is being published
because the copies are unavailable. This should be understood as the religious
devotion or literary devotion of the founder of Jnanapith, Shri Shanti Prasadji
Sahu, and its director, Shri Lakshmichandraji Adika, that they are engaged in
the publication of Jinvani with great zeal and dedication. In a short time,
Jnanapith has published such a vast amount of literature while protecting the
standard of publication, which many other institutions together could not do.
The contribution of the late Shri Ramaji, the chairperson of Jnanapith, to this
publishing institution will be remembered forever. Not only did she contribute
to the publication of Jinvani, but she also spent thousands of rupees with
proper arrangements for the renovation of ancient pilgrimage sites like Papoura,
Ahar, etc. She had the capacity to build many more Jain temples, but instead of
building new ones, she considered it better to renovate the pre-existing
temples. I hope that this second edition will also end like the first edition,
increasing the faith of the people. I wished that this edition would also be
adorned with appendices like the second editions of Adipurana and Uttarapurana,
but due to the urgency of publication and my own busyness, I could not prepare
the appendices. I regret this. Varnibhavan, Sagar 1-8-1606   Vinit Pannalal

## Introduction  The editing of the Padmacarita was done based on the following
manuscripts [1]  **Introduction of Manuscript 'K'**  This manuscript belongs to
the Digambar Jain Saraswati Bhandar, Dharmpura, Delhi. It was obtained through
the kind efforts of Shri Pandit Parmanandji Shastri. It contains 246 leaves of
1246 inches in size. Initially, there are 15-16 lines per leaf and 40 characters
per line, but later there are 24 lines per leaf and 57-58 characters per line.
The numbers of most of the verses are given in red ink, but only black ink is
used in the later part. This book was completed on the 7th Wednesday of
Paushvadi Samvat 1775 by Sukhananda, son of Man Singh, resident of Bhusawar. The
scribe of the book does not seem to be knowledgeable in Sanskrit language,
therefore many errors have occurred in the writing. The following inscription is
found at the end of this book:  _“Thus, the Shri Padmapuran is complete. Written
by Sukhananda, son of Man Singh, resident of Suyan, Bhusawar, in the Motr Vainda
script, written on the 7th Wednesday of Paushvadi Samvat 1775. May it give
auspiciousness and prosperity. Whoever sees this book, I have written it.
Whether it is correct or incorrect, my fault is not to be given. [1] The
qualities of a gentleman are to be taken. [2] This is truly done by him, which
is a giver of liberation and happiness.”_  The code name of this manuscript is
'K'.  **Introduction of Manuscript 'Kh'**  This manuscript belongs to the Shri
Digambar Jain Saraswati Bhavan Panchayati Mandir Masjid Khajur, Delhi. It was
obtained through the courtesy of Shri Pandit Parmanandji Shastri. It contains
510 leaves of 1145 inches in size. There are 14 lines per leaf and 40-41
characters per line. There is no mention of the year of copying or the scribe at
the end of the book. In the middle of this manuscript, several leaves have
become worn out, due to which they have been re-written by another writer. The
ancient script is mostly correct, but the newly added leaves have more errors.
At the beginning of this manuscript, there is also a Sanskrit commentary on 1-2
verses. The code name of this manuscript is 'Kh'.  **Introduction of Manuscript
'J'**  This manuscript belongs to the Shri Atishaya Kshetra Mahaveerji. It was
obtained through the courtesy of Shri Pandit Chainsukhdasji. It contains 554
leaves of 1245 size. Looking at the paper of the manuscript, it is clear that
this manuscript is very...

##  English Translation:  **12** **Padma Purana**  This manuscript is ancient,
but it does not contain any information about the scribe or the date of writing.
It seems that a page is missing from the end of this manuscript, otherwise, the
date and scribe's information would have been available. Due to the age of the
book, 44 new pages have been added at the beginning. These 44 pages have 13
lines per page and 40 to 45 characters per line. The original pages have 12
lines and 35 to 38 characters per line. Most of the script has been corrected.
This manuscript also contains a Sanskrit commentary on the first 1-2 verses,
similar to the 'Kha' manuscript. The code name of this manuscript is 'J'.  **[4]
Introduction to the 'B' Manuscript**  This book belongs to Pandit Dhannalal
Rishabhchandra Ramchandra of Bombay. This book has 265 pages, each measuring
13x6 inches. Each page has 19 lines and 55 to 60 characters per line. The date
of writing and the scribe's name are not available. However, it seems that the
scribe was knowledgeable in Sanskrit, as there are very few errors in the
script. Almost all the text has been written correctly. There are also
annotations on difficult passages in between. This manuscript has been of great
help in editing this edition. Its code name is 'B'.  **[5] Introduction to the
Commentary Manuscript**  This manuscript belongs to the Shri Di. Jain Saraswati
Bhandar, Dharmpura, Delhi. It was obtained through the courtesy of Shri Pandit
Parmanandji. This is a commentary manuscript. It has 58 pages, each measuring
10.5 inches. Very brief commentaries are given on the difficult passages of the
Padmacharit. The script of this book was completed on Sunday, the 5th of Paush,
Vikram Samvat 1894. It was written in Lashkar. The name of the scribe is not
mentioned. Regarding its creation, it is written at the end:  "Laat Wagad Shri
Pravachan Sen Panditan Padmacharitam Samakarnnya Balatkaragan Shreenandyaacharya
SatvashiShyena Shrichandramunin Shrimadvikramditya Samvatsare
Saptaashityadhikasahastra (Parimitam Shrimadharaayam Shrimato Rajye Bhojadevasya
Padmacharite)."  This means that this commentary was composed by Shri
Chandramuni, a disciple of Shri Nandi Acharya, in the year 1087 Vikram Samvat,
in Dharanagari, during the reign of King Bhoj. Due to the scribe's carelessness,
there are many errors in the script.  **[6] Introduction to the 'M' Manuscript**
This manuscript was published in three volumes in Vikram Samvat 1985 by Shri
Sahityaratna Pandit Darbarilalji Nyayatirith (Swami 'Satyabhakta' Vardha) from
the Shri Danveer Seth Manikchand Granthamala, Bombay. It is not known which
manuscripts were used by the said Panditji for editing this manuscript, but
there are many errors. Its code name is 'M'.  While taking and comparing the
readings of these manuscripts, wherever doubts remained, Pandit K. Bhujabali
Shastri had it compared with the palm leaf manuscript located in Moodbidri. In
this way, this edition has been edited by comparing it with many handwritten
manuscripts.  **Sanskrit Literature - Ocean**  Sanskrit literature is as vast as
an endless ocean. Just as there are many gems within the ocean, similarly, there
are Puranas, Kavya, Nyaya, Dharma, Vyakaran, Natak, etc. within the ocean of
Sanskrit literature.

## Introduction  There are many gems like Ayurveda, Astrology, etc. in
existence. You will not find a subject in ancient Sanskrit on which someone has
not written. The Sanskrit literature is vast, but even though Jain Sanskrit
literature is comparatively small in quantity, it is of a high quality. The main
characteristic of Jain literature is that the description of the subject matter
is heart-touching, it presents the facts of the subject matter, and it is
beneficial to all living beings.  ## Ramayana Literature  Maryadapurushotam
Ramachandra has been such a popular figure that he has been described not only
in the literature of India but also outside India with respect. He is not only
mentioned in Jain literature but also in Vedic and Buddhist literature. High-
quality texts have been written on this subject in ancient languages like
Sanskrit, Prakrit, Apabhramsha, etc., and in various regional languages of
India. Not only Puranas but also Kavya, Mahakavya, Natak, Upanatak, etc., have
been written in good numbers on this subject. Any writer who has taken recourse
to the Ramayana has infused life into his dull words. The example of Bhatti
Kavya is present.  ## Different Streams of Ramayana  This story has been written
in its own way by the followers of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, and all
three religions consider Rama as their ideal, great man. The general opinion of
most scholars is that the first basis of the Ramayana is Valmiki Ramayana. After
that, this story has been briefly recorded in the Mahabharata, Brahma Purana,
Padma Purana, Agni Purana, Vayu Purana, and all other Puranas with some changes.
Apart from this, many Ramayana texts have been written under the names Adhyatma
Ramayana, Anand Ramayana, Adbhut Ramayana. Based on these, the Tibetan and
Khothani Ramayana, the oldest work of Hindesh 'Ramayana Kaka Vin', the modern
'Serat Ram' of Java, and the Ramayana stories of Indochina, Siam, Burma, and Sri
Lanka have also been written. The Ramayana story of Valmiki Ramayana is famous
everywhere. Therefore, it is inappropriate to mention it. Yes, the story of
Sita's birth written in Adbhut Ramayana is unique, so I am presenting it here.
It is written that there was a sage named Gritsamad in Dandakaranya. His wife
prayed to him that Lakshmi be born from our womb. Hearing the wife's prayer, the
sage started keeping milk in a pot every day. At that time, Ravana arrived there
one day. To conquer the sage, he pierced the sage's body with the tips of his
arrows, extracting drop by drop of blood from his body and filling it in the
same pot. Ravana took the pot with him and gave it to Mandodari, saying, "This
blood is more potent than poison." After some time, Mandodari felt that her
husband did not love her truly, so in despair of life, she drank that blood. But
due to its effect, she did not die but became pregnant. Mandodari was frightened
by the conception in the absence of her husband and tried to hide it. Finally,
one day she went to Kurukshetra by plane and buried that womb in the ground.
Later, while plowing, that womb-born girl was found by King Janak, and he raised
her. This is Sita. In fact, this story of Adbhut Ramayana is amazing. There are
many other stories about Sita's birth, which I will mention in a separate
chapter. Among the Buddhists, the Pali language 'Jataka Kathavanna' has a brief
account of the Ramayana in the Dasaratha Jataka -

In the Padma Purana, King Dasharatha ruled righteously in Varanasi. His eldest
queen had three children: two sons [Rampandit and Lakshman] and a daughter [Sita
Devi]. After the queen's death, the king appointed another woman as his chief
queen. She gave birth to a son [Bharat Kumar]. On this occasion, the king
granted her a boon. When Bharat was seven years old, the queen requested the
kingdom for her son. The king flatly refused. But when the queen continued to
plead for it day after day, the king, fearing her schemes, called his two sons
and said, "Staying here might bring you harm, so go to another kingdom or forest
and live there. After my death, return and claim the kingdom." At that time, the
king summoned astrologers and asked them about his death. Upon receiving the
answer of twelve years, he said, "My sons, return after twelve years and claim
the throne." After paying their respects to their father, the two brothers were
about to leave when Sita Devi also bid farewell to her father and joined them.
Many others accompanied them. They returned and reached the Himalayas, where
they built an ashram and resided. After nine years, Dasharatha died due to grief
over his sons. The queen failed to make Bharat king as the ministers and Bharat
himself opposed it. Then, Bharat, with his four-armed army, went to the forest
to bring Ram. At that time, Ram was alone. Bharat told him the whole story of
his father's death and began to weep, but Rampandit neither grieved nor cried.
In the evening, Lakshman and Sita returned. Hearing of their father's death,
both were deeply saddened. To console them, Rampandit preached the Dharma of
impermanence. Hearing this, everyone was relieved of their sorrow. Later,
despite Bharat's repeated requests, Rampandit decided to stay in the forest,
saying, "My father ordered me to rule after twelve years, so I cannot return and
fulfill his command now. I will return after three years."  When Bharat also
refused to accept the throne, Rampandit gave him his Tridanda-Tridanda and said,
"These will rule until my return." Taking the Tridanda, Bharat returned to
Varanasi with Lakshman, Sita, and others. The ministers performed their duties
in the presence of these Tridanda. Whenever injustice occurred, the Tridanda
would strike each other, and when a just decision was made, they would become
silent.  After three years, Rampandit returned and married his sister Sita.
After ruling for sixteen thousand years, he ascended to heaven. At the end of
the Jataka, the Buddha explains the connection of the Jataka as follows: At that
time, King Shuddhodana was King Dasharatha. Mahamaya [Buddha's mother] was Ram's
mother, Yashodhara [Rahul's mother] was Sita, Anand was Bharat, and I was
Rampandit.  Similarly, in the "Anamakam Jataka," the story is told without
mentioning any specific character, but it is related to Ram's life. The special
feature of this Jataka is that Ram is not exiled by his father due to his
stepmother. He leaves the kingdom himself after hearing about his maternal
uncle's preparations for an attack.  Similarly, within the Chinese Tripitaka,
there is a collection of 121 Avadanas called "Tsa-Pau-Tsang-King." This
collection was translated into Chinese in 472 AD. It also contains a
"Dasharathakatha." It also mentions the Ramayana, with the special feature that
it does not mention Sita or any other princess.   Three... 1. In the third
century AD, "Anamakam Jataka" was translated into Chinese by Kang-Seng-Hui.
Although the original Indian text is unavailable, the Chinese translation is
preserved in the book "Lielu-Si King." [See the Taisho edition of the Chinese
Tripitaka No. 152]

## Introduction  It has not been done. The description of Dasharatha's four
queens comes - among them, Rama was born to the chief queen, Raman [Roman-
Lakshman] to the second queen, Bharata to the third queen, and Shatrughna to the
fourth. Due to the fear of the length of the writing, I am not giving the story
of 'Anamka Jataka' and 'Dasharathakatha'. _ In this way, we see three forms of
the Ramayana in Hindu and Buddhist literature - one of Valmiki Ramayana, the
second of Adbhut Ramayana, and the third of Buddhist Jataka.  ## Two Forms of
Jain Ramayana  _ Similarly, two streams of Ramayana are available in Jain
literature - one of Vimalsuri's 'Paumachariya' and Ravishena's 'Padmacharit',
and the other of Gunabhadra's 'Uttarapurana'. _ In the Shwetambar tradition,
some facts related to the lives of Tirthankaras and other Shalaka Purushas are
found in the 'Sthananga Sutra', which was taken as the basis for the creation of
'Trishatti Mahapurana' etc. by Shwetambar Acharya Hemchandra etc. In the
Digambar tradition, we find an ancient collection of the characters of
Tirthankaras etc. in the form of a list in the Prakrit language 'Tiloyapannatti'
text. This text also contains the main facts of the lives of 9 Narayana, 9
Pratinarayana, 9 Balabhadra, and 11 Rudras. Based on these and the stories heard
from their Guru Parampara, various Puranakaras have created many Puranas.
Vimalsuri has written in the introduction of 'Paumachariya' that "I, who is
bound in the list and has come from the Acharya Parampara, tell the entire
Padmacharit briefly according to the chronological order." It is clear from his
mention that he created 'Paumachariya' taking 'Namavali' as the main basis. The
character of Tirthankaras and other Shalaka Purushas, which is mentioned in the
form of a list in 'Tiloyapannatti', has also been given a place in their
respective texts by later Puranakaras. Ravishena has assimilated that Bhava in
the twentieth chapter of 'Padmacharit'. The mention of the subject of the
creation of this text at the end of this text proves that it was written in Veer
Nirvana Samvat 530, Vikram Samvat 60, but Western experts like Dr. Herman
Jacobi, Dr. Keith, Dr. Buhler etc., looking at its language style and use of
words, consider it to be written in the third-fourth century AD. After this,
Acharya Ravishena created the Sanskrit 'Padmacharit' in Veer Nirvana Samvat 1204
and Vikram Samvat 734. The stream of the story presented in these two texts can
be divided into the following six parts: [1] Description of the Vidhyadhar Kand,
Rakshas and Vanar lineage, [2] Birth and marriage of Rama and Sita, [3] Forest
wandering, [4] Sita's abduction and search, [5] War, [6] Uttar Charit. Their
brief story summary is as follows:  ## [1] Vidhyadhar Kand  First, King Shrenik
expresses his desire to know the true form of the Ramayana from Gautam Swami,
the first Ganadhar of Bhagwan Mahavira. In response, Gautam Swami tells the
Ramayana. In the beginning, the description of the Vidhyadhar Lok, Rakshas
lineage, Vanar lineage, and Ravana's lineage is given. The Rakshas lineage king
Ratnashrava and Keksi have four children - Ravana, Kumbhakarna, Chandranakha,
and Vibhishan. When Ratnashrava first saw his son Ravana, he saw ten heads in
the infant who was wearing a garland, so he was named Dashanan or Dashग्रीव. His

## Chapter 16  The Padma Purana describes how Ravana and his brothers went to
learn various sciences. Ravana acquired many sciences and returned. He then
married Mandodari and 6000 other women and conquered many kings in his
Digvijaya. In this account, Indra, Yama, Varuna, etc. are not gods but ordinary
Vidyaadhar kings. During this conquest, Ravana rejected the love proposal of a
woman named Nalakuvar, claiming to be superior. He heard the teachings of a
Kevali and vowed not to enjoy any woman who did not desire him. Ravana shattered
Indra's pride. The arrogance of Bali, a king, turned into detachment due to
Ravana's attack. Bali renounced the world and took the Daigambari initiation,
making Sugriva the king. Hanuman's true birth and his childhood antics amazed
everyone. Hanuman fought against Varuna on Ravana's behalf and married
Anangakusuma, the daughter of Chandra Nakha. Khara Dushan married Ravana's
sister, Chandranakha. Later, they had a son named Shambhuka.  ## [2] Birth and
Marriage of Rama and Sita  This chapter begins with the lineage of Janaka and
Dasharatha, followed by the mention of Dasharatha's three wives: 1. Kaushalya,
2. Sumitra, and 3. Suprabha. One day, Ravana learned that his death would be
caused by the descendants of King Janaka and Dasharatha. Ravana sent his brother
Vibhishan to kill them. However, before Vibhishan arrived, Narada warned both
kings, who left their palaces, leaving behind statues resembling their bodies.
Vibhishan, mistaking the statues for the real kings, killed them and threw their
heads into the salt sea, feeling secure. During his travels, King Dasharatha
reached Kekayi's Swayamvara. Kekayi placed a garland around Dasharatha's neck,
which angered other kings. This led to a war between them and Dasharatha. Kekayi
was a valiant woman and drove Dasharatha's chariot herself. King Dasharatha,
with his prowess and cunning, won the war and returned to Ayodhya to rule.
Dasharatha, cleverly pleasing Kekayi, asked her to ask for a boon, which he
promised to grant. He kept the boon safe in the royal treasury. Dasharatha had
four queens, including Kekayi, and they gave birth to four sons: Rama from
Kaushalya, Lakshmana from Sumitra, Bharata from Kekayi, and Shatrughna from
Suprabha.  King Janaka's wife, the queen of Videha, gave birth to a daughter,
Sita, and a son, Bhamandal. At birth, Bhamandal was abducted by an enemy from
his previous life. Bhamandal was found by a Vidyaadhar, who raised him. Seeing
Sita's portrait through Narada's grace, Bhamandal developed a strong affection
for her. He tricked Janaka into coming to the Vidyaadhar realm. Despite
Bhamandal's father's request, Janaka refused to give him his daughter, as he had
already promised her to Rama, the son of King Dasharatha. Finally, the
Vidyaadhar proposed a condition: if Rama could string the Vajraavarta bow, he
would get Sita; otherwise, they would forcefully take her for their son. Janaka
reluctantly agreed to this condition. The Swayamvara took place, and Rama strung
the bow. He married Sita. Dasharatha decided to give the kingdom to Rama. Then,
Kekayi, using the boon she had saved in the royal treasury, demanded that
Bharata be made the king. Hearing this, Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita left for the
south. They helped many troubled kings along the way. Kekayi and Bharata went to
the forest and requested Rama to return, but their efforts were in vain.

## Introduction [3] Forest Journey This section describes numerous battles
fought by Rama and Lakshmana. In one instance, they save Vajrakarn from
Chandrase, the son of Singhodara, and in another, they free Balakhilya from the
prison of a Mlechchha king. They also disguise themselves as dancers and
humiliate Raja Ativirya, who opposed Bharata. Meanwhile, Lakshmana marries
several princesses along the way. They reside in Dandaka forest, provide food to
the sages, and establish contact with Jatayu. 17 [4] The Abduction and the
Search Shambuka, the son of Chandranala and Saradushan, performs penance for
twelve years in a bamboo grove to attain the Suryahaas sword. As a result of his
penance, the sword appears. Lakshmana, by chance, arrives there and, before
Shambuka can take the sword, tests it by striking the same bamboo grove where
Shambuka is seated. This results in Shambuka's death. Chandranakha, upon
arriving to offer food, witnesses his death and grieves deeply. She becomes
infatuated with Rama and Lakshmana and proposes love, but when she fails, she
returns to her husband and informs him of her son's death. Lakshmana engages in
battle with Khara and Dushan. At Khara's call, Ravana arrives to assist. In the
midst of this, Ravana is captivated by Sita and devises a plan to abduct her.
Using his knowledge of magic, he learns that Lakshmana has established a signal
of a lion's roar to call Rama for help. Ravana, through a deceptive lion's roar,
sends Rama to Lakshmana's side and abducts Sita. Seeing Sita alone, After Sita's
abduction, Rama is deeply distressed. He befriends Sugriva. A Vidyaadhar named
Saahasagati, assuming Sugriva's form through magic, attempts to seize Sugriva's
wife and kingdom. Rama kills him, allowing Sugriva to reclaim his wife and
kingdom, becoming Rama's devotee. Following Sugriva's orders, they search for
Sita. The Vidyaadhar Ratnajaati informs them that Ravana has abducted Sita. At
that time, Ravana was very powerful, so Sugriva and other Vidyaadhars retreat
from battle. However, they recall the words of the Kevali Anantvirya, who said
that whoever lifts the stone will be the one to kill Ravana. Lakshmana lifts the
stone, proving his strength. Sugriva and others are convinced. All the
Vanarvanshi Vidyaadhars stand with Rama against Ravana. Hanuman, carrying Rama's
message, reaches Sita and brings her message back to Rama.  [5] The War With the
help of Sugriva and other Vidyaadhars, the entire army reaches Lanka through the
sky. Ravana demonstrates his mastery of the Bahurupini Vidya (the art of
assuming multiple forms). Hanuman and others try to hinder his mastery, but
Ravana remains steadfast and completes the Vidya. He then engages in a conflict
with Vibhishan, who ultimately abandons Ravana and joins Rama. Rama vows to make
Vibhishan the king of Lanka. A fierce battle ensues on both sides. Lakshmana is
struck by a weapon, but recovers with the water from Vishalya's bath.
Lakshmana's affection for Vishalya deepens. Finally, Ravana throws the
Lakshmanpur Chakra, but it circles around and lands in Lakshmana's hand.
Lakshmana uses the same Chakra to end Ravana's life. Lakshmana, after killing
Prati Narayan, manifests as Narayan. [3]

## Chapter 18  [6] Uttara Charit  In Ayodhya, Ram and Lakshman return and begin
ruling. Bharat, renouncing the world, takes initiation. Ram, troubled by public
opinion, abandons pregnant Sita in the forest. Sita takes shelter with King
Vajrangh. There, she gives birth to two sons, Lavana and Ankush. When they grow
up, Lavana and Ankush fight with Ram and Lakshman. Finally, at Narada's request,
father and sons reconcile. At the urging of Hanuman, Sugreev, Vibhishan, etc.,
Ram calls Sita. Sita undergoes the fire ordeal and then becomes an Arhatika.
Through tapasya, she attains the sixteenth heaven and becomes Prati-Indra. One
day, two Devas, Narayana and Balabhadra, come to test the love of Ram and
Lakshman. They falsely tell Lakshman that Ram has died. Hearing this, Lakshman
dies. Overwhelmed by grief for his brother, Ram wanders for six months carrying
Lakshman's body. Finally, through the efforts of the Deva who was the commander
of the army of Krtaantavaktra, the truth is revealed, and Lakshman is cremated.
Ram, renouncing the world, performs tapasya and attains liberation.  **From the
Padma Purana**  This narrative has widespread circulation in the Jain community.
The Jain Ramayana by Hemchandracharya, which is a part of the Trishatisalaaka
Purusha Charit, is developed along the lines of this narrative. The Rama Purana
by Jindas, the Rama Charit by Padmadev Vijay Gani, and the Ramakatha found in
various Kathas are all influenced by this narrative. The Paumachariu in
Apabhramsha language by Svayambhu Deva and the Karnataka Padma Ramayana by
Nagachand are also in line with this narrative.  **The second narrative is from
the Uttara Purana by Gunabhadracharya.** Gunabhadra was a disciple of Jinasena.
The mention "Kavi Parameshvara Nigadit Gadyakatha Matrukam Purocharitam" in
Jinasena's work clarifies that he composed the Adi Purana based on the prose
"Vagartha Sangrah" Purana by Kavi Parameshvara. Jinasena passed away before
completing the Adi Purana, so the remaining Adi Purana and the Uttara Purana
were composed by his enlightened disciple Gunabhadra. It is highly likely that
Gunabhadra also used Kavi Parameshvara's "Vagartha Sangrah Purana" as the basis
for composing the Uttara Purana, but this work is currently unavailable.
Therefore, Gunabhadra's name comes first as the originator of this second
narrative of the Ramakatha. In the 67th and 69th chapters of the Uttara Purana,
in 1167 verses, Ram and Lakshman are described as the eighth Balabhadra and
Narayana. This description differs from the descriptions in the Paumachariu and
Padma Charit. A notable point is that Sita is not considered the daughter of
Janaka but the daughter of Ravana and Mandodari. We will discuss Sita's birth in
a separate section later. It will be clear that "Sita was the daughter of
Ravana" was not only Gunabhadra's opinion but is also mentioned in the Tibetan
Ramayana and other texts. Therefore, it is likely that this second version of
the Ramakatha had gained significant popularity during Gunabhadra's time, and he
received this opinion from his Guru Parampara. Therefore, he has mentioned it
according to the Acharya Parampara. Although reading this narrative after
reading the first narrative of the Padma Charit might seem strange, this
narrative does not seem entirely baseless. In the Apabhramsha language
Mahapurana, the great poet Pushpadanta, in the Kannada language Trishatisalaaka
Purusha Purana, Chamunda Raya, and in the Punyasrava Kathasar, Nagaraj, have all
written their works following Gunabhadra's narrative.  **The brief plot of the
Uttara Purana is as follows:**  King Dasharatha of Varanasi has four sons: Ram
from the womb of Kausalya, Lakshman from the womb of Sumitra, and later, when
Dasharatha establishes his capital in Saketa, Bharat and Shatrughna are also
born from some queen.   1. Although Ravishena has written about Lakshman as the
son of Sumitra, he sometimes mentions him as the son of Kaikeyi, for example, in
this verse:  "Sumitra's son, but sometimes when he refers to him as the son of
Kaikeyi..."

## English Translation:  19 They are born from the womb. Here, the names of
Bharat and Shatrughna's mother are not given. Dashanan, the destroyer of ten, is
the son of Pulatsya from the Vidhyadhar lineage. One day, he sees Manimati, the
daughter of Amitvega, performing austerities and, becoming attached to her,
tries to obstruct her practice. Manimati resolves, "I will be born as his
daughter and kill him." After death, she enters the womb of Mandodari, Ravana's
queen. After her birth, astrologers tell Ravana that this daughter will destroy
him. Therefore, fearing this, Ravana orders Maricha to abandon her somewhere.
Placing the girl in a casket, Maricha buries it in the Mithila country. Due to
the tip of a plow getting entangled, the casket is revealed and brought to the
king by the people. Janak opens the casket, sees the girl, names her Sita, and
raises her as his daughter. After a long time, Janak invites Rama and Lakshmana
to protect his yagna. After the yagna is completed, Rama and Sita are married.
After this, Rama marries seven other maidens, and Lakshmana marries sixteen
royal princesses, including Prithvi Devi. Both, following Dasharatha's order,
reside in Varanasi.  **Introduction**  Hearing the description of Sita's beauty
from Narada, Ravana resolves to abduct her. To test Sita's mind, Shurpnakha is
sent, but seeing Sita's chastity, she returns to Ravana, saying that it is
impossible to sway Sita's mind. When Rama and Sita are strolling in the
Chitrakoot garden near Varanasi, Maricha, assuming the form of a golden deer,
lures Rama away. Meanwhile, Ravana, taking Rama's form, tells Sita that he has
sent a golden chariot and orders her to board it. This chariot is actually the
Pushpak Vimana, which takes Sita to Lanka. Ravana does not touch Sita because
the touch of a chaste woman destroys his celestial flying ability.  Dasharatha
learns through a dream that Ravana has abducted Sita and sends this news to
Rama. Meanwhile, Sugriva and Hanuman arrive to seek help against the demon.
Hanuman goes to Lanka, consoles Sita, and returns. [There is no mention of the
burning of Lanka.] After this, Lakshmana kills the demon, and Sugriva gains
control of his kingdom. Now, the army of monkeys sets out towards Lanka with
Rama's army. At the end of the detailed description of the war, Lakshmana
beheads Ravana with his chakra. After this, Lakshmana conquers the world,
becomes a semi-universal emperor [Narayana], and returns to Ayodhya. Lakshmana
has sixteen thousand wives, and Rama has eight thousand. Sita has eight sons.
[There is no mention of Sita's abandonment.] Lakshmana dies of an incurable
disease and goes to hell due to the killing of Ravana. Rama, after crowning his
son, Prithvisundar, on the throne and Sita's son, Ajitangaya, as the crown
prince, takes initiation and attains liberation. Sita, along with many queens,
also takes initiation and goes to the heaven of Achyuta.  This Ramayana of the
Uttarapurana is not prevalent in the Shvetambar sect. The Ramayana in Acharya
Hemchandra's Trishatishalaka Purushacharita is completely in line with the story
of the 'Paumachariya' or Padmacharita. It seems that both 'Paumachariya' and
'Padmacharita' were available to Hemchandracharya. Gunabhadracharya  It is said
that Ravana, with his excellent arrows, stopped the son of Kekaya, who was like
a mountain cloud. [Verse 94, Chapter 74] The son of Kekaya, who was seated in
the sky, released the Mahendra weapon. [Verse 100, Chapter 4]  An investigation
of the text reveals that Ravishaena has written the name of Bharat's mother as
'Kekaya' and has referred to Lakshmana's mother with both the names 'Sumitra'
and 'Kekaya'.

The *Padma Purana* predates Hemachandracharya, so it is likely that he would
have encountered the *Paumachariyu* and *Padmacharit* before him. However, it
remains a mystery why he did not incorporate them into his own narrative.  The
*Paumachariyu* and *Padmacharit* Ramakatha largely follows the Valmiki Ramayana,
as both texts clearly indicate that King Shrenik encouraged Gautam Swami to tell
the true story of Rama. This suggests that a Ramakatha was prevalent in society
at the time, which depicted Ravana, Kumbhakarna, etc. as carnivorous demons, and
Sugriva, Hanuman, etc. as monkeys. Furthermore, historians have placed the
Valmiki Ramayana in the pre-Christian era, making it possible for the authors of
the *Paumachariyu* and *Padmacharit* to have encountered it. The description of
Sita's birth in the *Uttara Purana* resembles the style of the *Vishnu Purana*.
The fact that Dasharatha was the king of Banaras aligns with the Buddhist
Jataka. However, unlike the *Uttara Purana*, the Buddhist Jataka does not
include Sita's abandonment or the birth of Lava and Kusha. In essence, the three
prevalent streams of the Ramakatha in India have existed in the Jain community
since ancient times.  **Various Accounts of Sita's Birth**  These streams
exhibit significant variations regarding Sita's birth, making it appropriate to
compile these differences in this column.  The following beliefs regarding
Sita's birth are available:  [1] Sita is the daughter of Janaka.  This is
mentioned in the Ramakatha of the *Mahabharata* and *Harivansha*, the
*Paumachariyu*, *Padmacharit*, and the *Adi Ramayana*.  [2] Sita is the daughter
of the Earth.  This is mentioned in the Valmiki Ramayana and other Ramakatha
based on it. The northern text of the Valmiki Ramayana also mentions her as the
mental daughter of Janaka and Menaka, but the origin of a human being from the
Earth seems completely incongruous.  [3] Sita is the daughter of Ravana.  This
is mentioned in the *Uttara Purana*, *Vishnu Purana*, *Maha Bhagavata Purana*,
*Kashmiri Ramayana*, *Tibetan Ramayana*, and *Khotanese Ramayana*.  [4] Sita was
born from a lotus.  This is mentioned in the *Adbhuta Ramayana*, and its
detailed story has been previously discussed.  [5] Sita was born from the womb
of Mandodari, who received the blood of a sage.  This is mentioned in the
*Dashavatar Charit*.  [6] Sita was born from fire.  This is mentioned in the
*Anand Ramayana*.

## Introduction [7] Sita is the daughter of Dasharatha. This Dasharatha Jataka
is written in Java's Ramkeling, Malay's Seriram, and the Hikayat Maharaja
Ravana. The story of Dasharatha Jataka has already been given. I am not giving
other stories due to the fear of writing extensively.  ## The Padmacharita and
Acharya Ravishena The Sanskrit Padmacharita is a very ancient text in Digambar
Katha literature. The protagonists of the text are the eighth Balabhadra Padma
(Rama) and the eighth Narayan Lakshmana. Both these individuals are revered by
the people, so whatever the poet has written about them is like a Mandakini
flowing from the mental Himalayas, as if it were the inner voice of the poet.
Acharya Ravishena, taking the opportunity, has depicted the characters of
Vidhyadharaloka, Anjana-Pavananjay, Hanuman, and Sukoshal, etc., which has
increased the interest of the text so much that one does not feel like leaving
it once they start reading it.  Its author is Acharya Ravishena. He has not
mentioned any of his sangha or ganagachchha, nor has he discussed the place,
etc., but from the name Senant, it seems that he might have belonged to the Sen
sangha. It seems that the full names of his guru parampara would be Indrasen,
Divakarasen, Arhatsen, and Lakshmanasen. He has mentioned his guru parampara in
the latter half of the 167th shloka of the 123rd parva of this Padmacharita as
follows: 'Aasi Dindragurodiwakarayati: Shishyo'sya chahanmuni Tasmal
Lakshmanasenasanmuniradah Shishyo Ravistu Smritam'. Meaning: Divakar Yati was
the guru of Indraguru, Arhatmuni was the disciple of Divakar Yati, Lakshmanasen
was the disciple of Arhatmuni, and Ravishena was the disciple of Lakshmanasen.
Who were all these people from which province? Who were their parents, etc.? And
what was their domestic life like? We do not know any of this. When was the
Padmacharita completed? He has mentioned this in the 181st shloka of the 123rd
parva as follows: "Dwishataabhyadhike sama sahasra
samatite'ardhachaturythavarshayukte. Jinbhaaskara Vardhamanasiddhe Charitam
Padmamuneridaam Nibaddham ||181|| Meaning: This charita of Padmamuni was written
after 1203 years and 6 months had passed since the nirvana of Jin Surya Bhagwan
Mahavira. Thus, its composition was completed in 734 Vikram Samvat. Udyotan
Suri, who came after him, has mentioned Ravishena, the author of Padmacharita,
and Jatilmuni, the author of Varangacharita, in his Kuvalayamala, which was
written in 835 VS. Similarly, Jinsen, the author of Harivansh Purana, has also
mentioned Ravishena well in his Harivansh Purana, which was written in 840 VS.

## Chapter 22: The Basis of the Padmacharita  This chapter discusses the basis
of the Padmacharita. Ravishena himself, in the 41st and 42nd verses of the first
chapter, mentions this as follows:  "This meaning, spoken by Vardhamana
Jinendra, was received by Indrabhuiti, the Gautama Ganadhara. Then it was
received by Sudharma, the son of Dharini, then by Prabhava, and then by the best
speaker, the Anuttarvagmi, the great orator,  Kitidhara Acharya. After that,
Ravishena Acharya, having obtained their writings, made this effort manifest."
(41-42)  In the 166th verse of the 123rd chapter, he also mentions this in the
same way:  "The truth that was spoken by the revered Vardhamana Jinendra, who is
worshipped by all the worlds, was spoken by Indrabhuiti, the Gautama Ganadhara,
for Sudharma and Jambuswami. This was later revealed by his disciple, the
Anuttarvagmi, the great orator, Kitidhara Muni. This account of the Padma Muni
is a cause for welfare, for the growth of the meditation of the virtuous, and is
the best auspiciousness." (166)  Here, one should understand that Kitidhara is
referred to by the epithet Anuttarvagmi.  The self-born poet, in his Apabhramsha
language 'Paumachariu', composed his work based on Ravishena's Padmacharita.
Ravishena, while mentioning the basis of the literary tradition in the
Padmacharita, wrote the 41st and 42nd verses in the first chapter. Keeping these
verses in mind, the self-born poet also wrote the following verse:  "From the
mouth of Vardhamana, this story of Rama has come."  1. While translating the
41st and 42nd verses of the first chapter, the reading 'tato'anuttarvagminam'
was imagined for the sake of the meaning of the word Anuttarvagmi in the 167th
verse of the 123rd chapter. However, all the manuscripts have the reading
'tato'anuttarvagminam'. Therefore, it seems appropriate to consider
'Anuttarvagminam' as an epithet of Kiti. 'Anuttarvagminam' means the best
speaker. In the 167th verse of the 123rd chapter, one should understand that
Kitidhara is referred to by this epithet Anuttarvagmi, because Kiti is not
mentioned separately there. The self-born poet, in his Apabhramsha
'Paumachariu', also considered 'Anuttarvaae' as an epithet of Kitidhara in the
phrase 'Kittinarena Anuttarvaae'. According to this correction, the reader
should correct the translation of the 41st and 42nd verses of the first chapter.
I am grateful to the honorable Dr. A.N. Upadhyaya for bringing this to my
attention.

## Introduction  This is a stream of the Ramayana story, which originated from
the cave of the mouth of Vardhamana Jina. It then reached Indrabhuti Acharya,
then Gunalankrita Sudharma Acharya, then Prabhava, then the eloquent and supreme
speaker Koti Dhar. After that, it was immersed in the same Ramayana stream by
the grace of Ravishena Acharya.  This way, the mention of Ravishena, who is
supported by the self-existent, indicates that the basis of his Padmacarita is
the Ramayana story narrated by Acharya Koti Dhar. But who is this Kirti Dhar?
His mention is not found in the Acharya tradition. And where did his Ramayana
go? Nothing is known about it. It is possible that it was lost like the 'Vagarth
Sangrah Parana' of the poet Parameshwar.  ## Paumachariya and Padmacarita  On
the one hand, we know that the basis of Ravishena's Padmacarita, which he
presented, is the Ramayana story presented by Muni Kirti Dhar. On the other
hand, when we see the same story, the same style of presentation, the same
purpose, the same name, and the same meaning of the verses in many places in the
Prakrit 'Paumachariya' of Vimal Suri, a kind of doubt arises. The time of the
creation of the Paumachariya, as given by Vimal Suri, indicates that it was
written in Vikram Samvat 60, and Ravishena's Padmacarita appears 674 years
later. If Ravishena used the Paumachariya as a basis for his Padmacarita, then
he should have mentioned the name of the Jain Acharya with gratitude. But he has
mentioned someone else's name... This is a matter of consideration.  I don't
want to believe that the Paumachariya was created at the time mentioned by Vimal
Suri. In the Anekant Varsh 5 Kiran 10-11, a significant article titled
'Paumachariya ka Antah Parikshan' was published by Shri Pan. Paramanandji
Shastri Sarsawa. With the permission of Shastriji, I am presenting that article
here in his own words, so that readers can get the right material for
consideration.  ## Internal Examination of Paumachariya  'Paumachariya' is a
biography written in Prakrit language, which depicts the story of Ramachandra
well. The author of this book is Vimal Suri. The author has not given any
special introduction of himself in this book, but has only stated that - "Vijay
was the disciple of Acharya 'Rah', who accepted the harmony of his own time and
the time of others, and I, 'Vimal', the disciple of Vijay, the descendant of
Nail-Kul-Nandikara, have composed this book." Although many story books have
been written by different poets about this story, but all the available ones are
considered to be later than the composition of Paumachariya. Because this book
mentions the time of creation of the book as 530 years after the Nirvana of
Veer, i.e. Vikram Samvat 60. The author has stated that in this book, he has
narrated the same Ramayana story in Prakrit language with sutras and verses,
which was told by Lord Mahavira in ancient times, which later...  1. Rah

## The Padma Purana  **Chapter 24**  This was spoken by Indra-bhuiti, the chief
Ganadhara, to the disciples from the Dharma-shaya, and it remained in the world
through the Sadhu-parampara until that time.  **Time of Composition**  **3**
There is a great difference of opinion among scholars regarding the time of
composition of this text. Some scholars, like Dr. Winternitz, consider the time
specified in the text to be correct. However, Western scholars like Dr. Herman
Jacobi, etc., based on the style of composition, language, literature, etc.,
consider its time of composition to be the 3rd-4th century CE. Some scholars,
like Dr. Keith, etc., point to the presence of words like "Dinar" and some Greek
words related to astrology in the text, and therefore consider it to be from 300
CE or later. And the expert in prosody, Shri Diwan Bahadur Keshav Lal Dhruva,
expresses strong doubts about the said time of composition, considering it to be
a much later composition. In his writing, he has stated that the use of the
Gahini, Sharabha, etc., meters at the end of each chapter, the Yamaka in the
Giti, and the word "Vimala" at the end of the chapters, are all indicative of
its modern nature. Apart from these, many other scholars are doubtful about its
time of composition - they hesitate to accept the time specified in the text,
and thus its time of composition remains in the realm of doubt. In such a
situation, the time mentioned in the text cannot be readily accepted.  **4**
After examining the available opinions of scholars regarding the time of the
text, I have examined the internal literature of the text, and based on that, I
have reached the conclusion that the said time of composition of the text is not
correct - it is definitely the result of some mistake or error by the author or
scribe. And it is also possible that the incorrect propagation of the number of
years of Vira Nirvana, like the Saka era, is the reason for this. But whatever
it may be, the internal examination of the text has revealed to me other
specific reasons for the incorrectness of the said time, which are divided into
three parts:  **(1)** The Paumachariya was not composed before the Digambara-
Svetambara sect split.  **(2)** The text adopts the beliefs of the Digambara
Acharya Kundakunda.  **(3)** The text follows the Tattvartha Sutra of Umashvatik
very closely.  Now I will explain these three types of reasons in order.
**(1)** According to the Digambara belief, the Digambara-Svetambara sect split
occurred in Vikram Samvat 136, and according to the Svetambara belief, it
occurred in Samvat 139. Before this split, in the Jain literature, for the Jain
Sadhus:  1. "Panchaiva ya vasasaya dusamae tis varis sanjutta. Vire siddhimupgae
tao nibaddham imam chariyam || 103 || Eyam virajinena ramchariyam siddham
mahattham pura, Pacchakhandalabhuina u kahiyam sisas dhammasayam. Bhuo

## Introduction 25 The terms 'Digambar' and 'Svetambar' are not explicitly used
anywhere. If the word 'Svetambar' (Siyambar) is found in this text for a Jain
monk, it indicates that this text was not written before Vikram Samvat 136, the
time when the Digambar and Svetambar sects were not yet established. There is a
clear example of such usage in the 22nd chapter of the text. For example: >
Pechchha paribhamantō dāhiṇadesē siyamvaram paṇao | > Tassa sagāsē dhammam
suṇīūṇ tao samāḍhatto ||78|| > Aha bhai muni varadō śiśuṇ sudhammam jiṇehi
parikahyam | Jeṭho ya samaṇadhammo sāvayadhammo ya aṇujeṭho || 79 ||  This
passage describes a Jain monk who was encountered by the dethroned king Saudās
while traveling in the south, and from whom he took the vows of a lay follower.
This monk is referred to as a Svetambar monk. Therefore, this text cannot be a
composition from before Vikram Samvat 136.  Here, I would like to point out that
the Svetambar scholar Muni Kalyanvijayji, in his book 'Shraman Bhagwan
Mahavira', writes that before the 7th century Vikram era, neither the Digambar
nor the Svetambar traditions used the terms 'Digambar' and 'Svetambar' for each
other. This is evident from his following statement: > "It was from this time
(from the beginning of the 7th century Vikram era to the end of the 10th
century) that the practice of calling each other Digambar and Svetambar began."
|| Page 307  If Muni Kalyanvijayji's research is accurate, then the composition
of the Paumachariy cannot be before the 7th century Vikram era, not just Vikram
Samvat 136. The oldest mention of this text so far is found in the text
'Kuvalayamala', which was written in Shaka Samvat 700, equivalent to Vikram
Samvat 835.  (2) Shri Kundakunda is the chief Acharya of the Digambar sect. In
his 'Charitpahuḍ', while describing the Sagara Dharma, he mentions Sallekhana as
the fourth Shikshavrata. This belief is not mentioned in any text before him,
and therefore it is considered to be his unique belief. This belief of his has
been adopted by Vimalsuri, the author of 'Paumachariy'. This belief is not
mentioned anywhere in the Svetambar Agam Sutras. The following statement from a
letter received by Mukhtar Sahib from Muni Punyavijayji also reveals the same: >
"Sallekhana is not included as a Shikshavrata in the twelve vows in any of the
Svetambar Agams."  There is a lot of similarity between the verses of
'Charitpahuḍ' related to Sagara Dharma and those found in 'Paumachariy', as
evident from the comparison below: ― [4]  > Pancheṇuvvayā guṇavvayāī havanti tah
tiṣṇi | Sikkhavay cattāriy sanjamacaraṇam ca sāyaram ||23|| > Tasakāya hē thūlē
mōsē adattalē ya | Parihāro para mahilā pariggahārambha parimāṇam || 24 || >
Disavidisamaṇapaḍhamaṁ aṇatya iṇḍassa vajjaṇam vidiyam | Bhogopabhoga parimā
iyameva guṇavvayā tiṣṇi || 25 ||

26 Padmapurana Samaiya, the first, Vidiya, the second, and Posaha, the third,
are said. The fourth is Sallekhana at the end. ||26|| -Charittrapahuḍ Five are
the Anuvvaya, three are the Gunavvaya, it is said. Four are the Sikkhavaani, the
Jina's wishes. ||112|| Thullayaram, Panivahan, Musavaayam, Adattadaan, and
Parajuvaai's Nivatti, Santoshavayam, the fifth. ||113|| Disivi-disa's Niyamo,
Anaththadandas's Vajjan, and Uvabhog-parimaanam, these three are the Gunavvaya.
||114|| Samaiya, Uvvaas-Posaha, Atihisanvibhaago, and Samahimaran at the end,
these four are the Sikkhaasuvaya. ||115|| -Paumcharia U.14 Apart from this, the
following verse from Acharya Kundakunda's Pravachnasara is also available in
Paumcharia with some word changes. The karma that the ignorant one eats, with
thousands of crores of births, that karma the wise one eats with a single
breath. ||38|| -Pravachnasara A. 3 The karma that the ignorant tapaswi eats,
with thousands of crores of births, that karma the wise one eats with a single
breath, the great one. ||177|| -Paumcharia U. 102 In such a situation, the
composition of Paumcharia cannot be before Kundakunda. The time of Kundakunda is
found to be approximately the latter half of the first century and the early
half of the second century of the Vikram era. It cannot be said to be after the
third century in any way. In such a situation, the time of the creation of
Paumcharia, which is said to be 6 CE, does not seem to be consistent. Muni
Kalyanvijayji has stated the time of Kundakunda to be the sixth century CE.
According to his belief, he will either have to state Paumcharia to be a text
after the sixth century CE or show Sallekhana (Samadhimaran) as the fourth
Sikkhaavrat in some Shvetambara text written before 60 CE. Otherwise, the time
of Kundakunda will have to be accepted as before 60 CE. [3] Comparing the sutras
of the Tattvarth Sutra written by Umashvati with some places in Paumcharia, a
great similarity in words and a good understanding of the style of the statement
sequence is found. And this similarity of words, etc., does not have as much
connection with the Shvetambara commentary-accepted text as it seems to have
with the Digambara Sutra text. Not only this, but also the sutras which have not
been given a place in the commentary-accepted text and about which the
commentators of the commentary, Haribhadra and Siddhasena Gani, state in their
commentary that here some other scholars put many new sutras on their own for
the sake of expansion, many of these sutras are found in this text according to
the Digambara tradition-accepted Sutra text. Here, for the information of the
readers, some comparisons of the sutras of Tattvarth Sutra and the verses of
Paumcharia are given below. 1. See, Anekanta Varsh 2 Kiran 1 First Article, 'Who

## Introduction  The language of the Iriya is the same as that of the Aayana.
The pronunciation is the same as the Panchamiya, which is 71.  - Paumachariy U.
14:  "External austerities are:  abstinence from food, beauty, occupation,
counting, taste, renunciation, secluded bed and seat, and bodily afflictions.
||19||  Penance, humility, conduct, self-study, renunciation, meditation, and
higher austerities are the internal ones. ||20||"  Tattvarth. A. 9: "Anasana
means bodily affliction, which is the same as the twenty-two kinds of bodily
afflictions. Renunciation of taste is the same as secluded bed and seat. ||74||
Penance, humility, conduct, self-study, renunciation, meditation, and higher
austerities are the internal ones. ||75||"  - Paumachariy U. 14:  It is clear
from this comparison that many of the verses of the Paumachariy are based on the
sutras of the Tattvarth Sutra. At the end of the book, the author has also
stated in the sentence "Ettahe Vimaleṇa Sutta Sahiyam Gaahanivaddham Kayam" that
he has compiled the sutras into verses. In such a situation, it is certain that
this book was written after the Tattvarth Sutra. The author of the Tattvarth
Sutra, Acharya Umasvati, was also a follower of Shri Kundakunda Acharya - he was
in the lineage of Kundakunda, as is evident from many inscriptions in
Shravanabelagola, etc. And therefore, the time of its composition given in the
Paumachariy becomes even more objectionable and certainly appears to be the
result of some mistake or error.  Some special features of the book:  On
examining the Paumachariy, it appears that some of the points are specifically
related to the beliefs of the Digambara sect, some are specifically related to
the beliefs of the Svetambara sect, and some are different from the beliefs of
both. Here I would like to present all of them for the consideration of
scholars, so that they can be helped in deciding which sect this book actually
belongs to; because it has not yet been fully decided whether the author of this
book was a Digambara, Svetambara, or Yapaniya Acharya. Some scholars consider
this book to be Svetambara, some Digambara, and some Yapaniya.  [A]  Digambara
sect related:  [1]  In the first chapter of the book, a verse describing the
origin of the story is found as follows:  "Vīrasas Pavaṛṭhāṇam Vipulagirimatthae
Maṇabhirāme. Tāha Indabhūi Kahiyam Seṇiya Raṇassa Nīsesam. ||34||"  This states
that when the Samavasaran of the Veer Bhagwan was situated on the Vipulachal
mountain, then Indra-bhuiti, the Gautam Ganadhar, told all this to King Shrenik.
This method of introducing the story is specifically related to the Digambara
sect. Almost all the books of the Digambara sect, in which the origin of the
story is mentioned, 1. See, Shravanabelagola inscriptions no. 40, 105, 108. 2.
This has also been accepted by the Svetambara historical scholar Shri Mohanlal
Dalichandraji Desai, Advocate Bombay, in his article "Kumarapalanā Samyanē Ek
Apbhraṃśa Kāvya" and has also been given as a reason for considering the author
of the said poetic work "Pradyumna Charit" to be a Digambara. See, "Jainacharya
Shri Atmanand-Janma Shatabdi-Smārak Granth" Gujarati article, p. 260.

##  Translation:  **30**  The Padma Purana mentions the event of the Veer
Bhagwan's Samavasaran on the Vipulachal mountain and the narration of the story
by Indrabhuiti-Gautam to King Shrenik in response to his question. However, the
tradition of the Svetambara scriptures differs from this. They mention the
story's origin as being told by Sudharma Swami to Jambu Swami, as evident in the
following verse from the Vasudeva Hindi of Sanghadas Gani:  "Tath tatra
Suhammasamina Jambu namas padhamanuyogay titthayarachchakkavatti
dasaravansaparuvangayam Vasudevachariyam kahiyam tti tasseva........tti."  The
Svetambaras claim that the original Agam scriptures were composed by Sudharma
Swami, while the Digambara tradition attributes their creation to Gautam
Ganadhar-Indrabhuiti.  **[2]** In the second chapter of the text, while
describing the Shikshavrata, the Samadhimaran Sallekhana Vrata is mentioned as
the fourth Shikshavrata. As stated:  "Samadhyam cha upavasaposaho
atihisanvibhago ya. Ante samahimaran sikkha suvayai chattari || 115 ||"  This
belief of considering Samadhimaran Sallekhana Vrata as a Shikshavrata is
specific to the Digambara sect. Clear evidence of this is found in the
Charitpahuḍ of Acharya Kundakunda, the Adipurana of Jinsen, the Ratnamala of
Shivkotika, the Bhavasangrah of Devasen, and the Shravakachar of Vasunandi. This
is also mentioned in the Varang Charit of Jayasimhanandi. The Svetambara Agam
Sutras do not mention this as a Shikshavrata anywhere, as evident in the
following statement from a letter written by Muni Shri Punyavijayaji to Mukhtar
Shri Jugalkishor:  "The Svetambara Agam does not include Sallekhana as a
Shikshavrata among the 12 Vratas anywhere." Therefore, this belief is
specifically associated with the Digambara sect.  **[b] Svetambara Sect
Related**  **[1]** The 82nd verse of the second chapter of this text mentions 20
reasons for the bondage of the Tirthankara nature. Although their names are not
mentioned in the text, this belief of 20 reasons is associated with the
Svetambara sect because their knowledgeable scriptures like Dharmakatha, etc.,
list 20 reasons. The Digambara sect's Shatkhandadi scriptures universally
mention 16 reasons.  **[2]** The 58th verse of the fourth chapter of the text
mentions 64,000 queens of Bharat Chakravarti. This number of queens is also
associated with the Svetambara sect. The Digambara sect mentions 96,000 queens.
**[3]** The 34th verse of the 73rd chapter of the text mentions the death of
Ravana on Jyeshtha Krishna Ekadashi. This belief seems to be in accordance with
the Svetambara sect, as Hemchandra Acharya also mentions this in his
"Trishashtisalakapurushacharitra."  1. See, Mukhtar Shri Jugalkishor's book
"Jainacharyon ka Shasan Bhed" chapter "Gunavrata and Shikshavrata." 2. "Vinsam
Jin Karanahan Bhaveo." 3. "Chausatthi Sahasssai Juwainam Paramruvadharinam." 4.
"Jettsass Bahulpakkhe Divassass Chauthbhagammi. Egarisi Divase Ravanamaaranam
Viyanahhi."

## Introduction  [31] The *Parushcharitra* mentions this date. It is also
possible that Hemachandracharya followed this text in his own work. Whatever the
case may be, there is no mention of this date in the Digambara sect, nor is it
found in the Valmiki Ramayana.  [4] In the 22nd chapter of the text (previously
quoted verses no. 77-78), the meat-eating king Soudasa is described as a
Shvetambara while he receives the Dharma-upadesha from the Jina Muni Maharaj
while traveling in the south.  In addition to these points, the text also
mentions the 12 Kalpas (Swagas) as a belief. Some scholars have pointed out this
as a Shvetambara belief; however, ancient texts like *Tiloyapannatti* and
*Varangacharitra* of the Digambara sect also mention 12 Swargas. The Digambara
sect accepts both the beliefs of 12 and 16 Swargas, along with their respective
Indras and their territories. This is clearly explained in the three verses no.
452, 453, 454 of *Triloksar*.  [5] In the 102nd chapter of this text, after
mentioning the Kalpas and Navagraha, the mention of Aditya and other Anudishas
is found as follows:  > *Kappanam pun uri navagevejjai manabhiramai. > Tan vi
anuddhisai pureo aiccha pamuhai.* ||145||  This belief of Anudishas is also
specifically related to the Digambara sect. All the texts of the Digambara sect
like *Patkhandagam*, *Dhavla*, *Tiloyapannatti*, *Lokavibhag*, and *Triloksar*
have the provision of Anudishas, while there is no mention of them in the
Shvetambara Agamas. Upadhyaya Muni Shri Atmaramji, in his book *Tattvarthsutra
Jainagam Samanvay*, published with Hindi translation, has clearly accepted on
page 119 that "the existence of nine Anudishas is not accepted in the Agam
texts."  [6] In the second chapter of this text, while narrating the birth story
of Veer Bhagwan, there is no mention of his being married. Instead, it clearly
states that when he left his childhood and turned thirty years old, he attained
*Vairagya* (dispassion) and took *Deeksha* (renunciation).  Furthermore, in the
twentieth chapter, he is counted among the Kumar Shramanas - the Jain
Tirthankaras who were celibate - along with Vasupujya, Malli, Arishtanemi, and
Parshva, who left their homes and became monks during their childhood. This
belief of Veer Prabhu not being married is also specifically related to the
Digambara sect, as there is no provision of his marriage in any Digambara text.
They unanimously declare him as unmarried, while the Shvetambara texts generally
describe him as married. In *Kalpasutra*:  > *Trishathi. Pu. Ch. 7-376 > 1. Tada

## English Translation:  32 Padmapurana  The text mentions the names of their
wives, daughters, and granddaughters. This is another point that the necessary
appointment [Verse No. 221-222], whose time of creation is not before the sixth
century, also mentions. Veer Bhagwan has been included in the Kumar Shramanas,
but this seems to be an acceptance of the Digambar belief. [7] In this text, in
the 83rd chapter, while describing the initiation of King Bharat, a verse is
given as follows: ``` Aṇṇao gurūṇam bharhao kāuṇ tatth'alaṁkāram. Nisśesasanga
rahi'o luñcai dhīro ṇipayakese || 5 || ``` This actually mentions Bharat Maharaj
renouncing all possessions and cutting his hair, giving up clothes and
ornaments, but the reading "kāuṇ tatth'alaṁkāra" here seems to be the result of
some mistake or change, otherwise, it would be incongruous to talk about being
free from all attachments while wearing ornaments and adorning oneself. Also,
the word "tatth" seems redundant. Therefore, this mention points towards the
Digambar belief.  Some different types: [1] This text mentions 15 dreams that
Marudevi, the mother of Bhagwan Rishabhdev, had, while the Svetambar sect
mentions 14 and the Digambar sect mentions 16. According to the Digambar belief,
there is a lack of a dream called "Simhasan" and according to the Svetambar
belief, there should be either "Viman" or "Bhawan". [2] In the following verse
of the 105th chapter of the text, the time difference between the Mahabharata
and the Ramayana is mentioned as 64,000 years. As follows: ``` C'ausatthi
sahas'sāiṁ varisa'ṇam antaraṁ samakkhāyam. Titth'ayare hi mahāyas'a
bharatarāmāyaṇātu || 16 || ``` This time difference is not supported by either
tradition, and it contradicts the time difference between the Tirthankaras
described by the author himself, because the Ramayana originated in the time of
the 20th Tirthankara Muni Suvrat, and the Mahabharata originated in the time of
the 22nd Tirthankara Neminath, and the author himself has mentioned the time
difference between the two Tirthankaras as 11 lakhs in the 20th, as follows: ```
Ch'ac'ceva samasaha'ss'a vīs'aiyam antaraṁ samuddiṭṭhaṁ. Pañceva hava'i lak'khā
jiṇantaraṁ ega vīs'aimam || 81 || ``` [3] In the following verse of the second
chapter, the origin of Kevalgyan from the destruction of Ashtakarma is mentioned
by Bhagwan Mahavira, as is evident from the following verse: ``` Aha aṭṭha karma
rahi'assa tassa jhāṇovajogajutta'ssa. Sayaljagajjoyakaram kevalaṇāṇam samuppanaṁ
|| 30 || ``` This statement is contradicted by both sects, because both sects
believe that Kevalgyan originates from the destruction of four ghatiyas karmas,
while moksha occurs from the destruction of Ashtakarma.  It is hoped that
scholars will consider all these points and be inclined to make a special
decision regarding the time of creation of the text and the relationship of the
author.

## Introduction ## Main Characters of Padmacharit  Although the main protagonist
of Padmacharit is the eighth Balabhadra Padma (Rama), the interaction with him
brings forth the beautiful character portrayals of many characters in the story,
which are extremely helpful for humans to achieve humanity. In this column, I am
introducing ten such characters briefly.  [1] **Ravana**  After losing to Indra,
the Vidhyadhar, he starts living in Mali Alankarpur (Patal Lanka). There, he has
a son named Ratna Shrava, who gets married to Kekasi when he grows up. This
couple, Ratna Shrava and Kekasi, are the parents of Ravana. Ravana was a brave
warrior from childhood. Kumbhakarna and Vibhishan were his younger brothers, and
Chandranakha was his younger sister. One day, Ravana was sitting in Kekasi's lap
when Vaishravana Vidhyadhar's chariot passed by in the sky. Seeing its grandeur,
Ravana asked his mother, "Mother! Who is this influential man going by?" His
mother, while introducing him, said, "He is your maternal uncle, very powerful.
He killed your father's brother and took Lanka from him. We are forced to spend
our days in this Patal Lanka." The vision of past glory starts dancing before
Kekasi's eyes, and thinking about the present situation, tears start flowing
from her eyes. Seeing his mother's sorrowful state, Ravana and Kumbhakarna
console her. Ravana goes to the dense forest to master various skills. The
unclothed Yaksha of Jambu Dwip tests him rigorously. He presents various
obstacles, troubles, and terrifying scenes. Sometimes, he tries to weaken his
resolve by showing him the miserable state of his mother and father, and
sometimes, he tries to frighten him by showing him the terrifying forms of
lions, tigers, snakes, etc. But, blessed is Ravana! He endures all the troubles
and does not deviate from his goal even for a moment. He returns after mastering
many skills. He was handsome, so he had relationships with many princesses. He
marries a pure and thoughtful girl like Mandodari. Ravana takes a vow from
Anantvirya Kevali that he will not touch any woman who does not want him.
Ravana's wisdom attracts the reader when he rejects the love proposal of
Nalakuvar's wife and gives her a beautiful lesson. Hearing the news of Narada's
plight in King Marutvak's violent Yagna, Ravana rushes to protect him and
destroys his hypocritical Yagna, promoting true Dharma. In the war with Varuna,
Kumbhakarna brings the women and children of Varuna's city as prisoners before
Ravana. Ravana reprimands Kumbhakarna, and his words are very touching. He says,
"Good man! You had a fight with Varuna, but why did you put innocent citizens'
women in such trouble? Why did you insult them? If you want your well-being,
return them to their homes with respect." After defeating many kings in his
conquest, Ravana captures Indra. The next day, Indra's father comes to his
residence. Ravana treats him with such humility as if he is the embodiment of
humility. The way Acharya Ravishena portrays his humility at that time touches
the heart. In this way, we see that Ravana eliminates the arrogant rival
Vidhyadharas and establishes his rule over the three parts of the southern
region of Bharat Kshetra and the Vijayadhar mountain. He was not a Rakshasa, but
a descendant of the Rakshasa clan. Valmiki has declared him a Rakshasa, stating
the facts.  According to the principle of "Bhavitavyaata Baliyasi", Ravana sees
Rama's wife Sita and becomes infatuated with her. He abducts her by deceit. He
keeps Sita in the Ashoka Vatika of Lanka and tries to win her over in every way
possible...

## English Translation:  **34** **Padma Purana**  He remains steadfast in the
vow he took before the Kevali even at that time and does not even touch his body
against Sita's wishes. With the rise of sin, Ravana's power of discernment is
lost, he becomes intoxicated with pride, rejects the wise counsel of Mandodari,
and scorns his brother Vibhishana, a wise and righteous man, forcing him to
leave Lanka. The army of Rama and the Vidyadharas surround Lanka from all sides.
Ravana demonstrates the Bahurupini Vidya in the temple of Shantinath. Inspired
by Lakshmana, many Vidyadharas create havoc in Lanka, but Ravana remains
steadfast like a mountain and demonstrates the Bahurupini Vidya. In the end, his
merit does not stand by him. The Sudarshan Chakra of Vishnu reaches Lakshmana,
and he kills Ravana. With Ravana's death, the first chapter of Rama's life ends.
**[2] Mandodari**  In the city of Asurasangeet, located on the southern range of
Vijay Parvat, King May, also known as Hemavati, resides. Mandodari is his
daughter. When King May, after consulting with his ministers, decides to marry
Mandodari to Ravana, Ravana was staying in the Bhima forest. May takes Mandodari
with him to meet Ravana. Mandodari's beauty captivates Ravana's heart. Their
marriage takes place according to the rituals. Mandodari becomes Ravana's queen
due to her virtues. We see that Mandodari is a very intelligent and wise woman.
She repeatedly guides Ravana towards the right path by giving him wise counsel.
Just as a single offering of water calms the rising milk, Mandodari's advice has
calmed Ravana's anger on many occasions. While Ravana was away from Lanka, Khara
and Dushana abducted Ravana's sister, Chandranakha. Upon returning to Lanka,
Ravana, upon hearing this news, becomes enraged and prepares to attack Khara and
Dushana. At that time, Mandodari's gentle and wise counsel calms Ravana's anger
in an instant. Acharya Ravishena's depiction of Mandodari's foresight and wisdom
is truly remarkable, as the reader will see for themselves by reading this
chapter. When Ravana returns to Lanka after abducting Sita, Mandodari tries in
various ways to bring her misguided husband back to the right path, which is
truly astonishing. Indrajit and Meghvahan are her sons. After Ravana's death,
when her two sons take initiation from the great sage Anantvirya, she is deeply
saddened, but the Arya named Shashikanta consoles her with her peaceful words,
leading her to become an Aryika along with many other women. Now, the queen of
the three-world-ruling Ravana adorns herself with only a white saree. In the
end, she performs penance and ascends to heaven.  **[3] King Dasharatha**  King
Dasharatha is the son of King Anaranya of Ayodhya. He is known for his simple
nature, handsome physique, and courageous spirit. He has four wives: Kaushalya
(Aparajita), Kekaya, Sumitra, and Suprabha, and they give birth to four sons:
Rama, Bharata, Lakshmana, and Shatrughna. He is a true friend, a veritable ocean
of friendship. The Mlechchas attack King Janaka. Upon hearing the news of his
friend's plight, King Dasharatha, with full preparation, rushes to Janaka's aid,
and the Mlechchas, defeated and destroyed, flee their country. Inspired by King
Dasharatha's support and friendship, King Janaka decides to give his daughter
Sita to Dasharatha's son, Rama. Due to the Narad's Lila, Janaka has to face many
struggles with the Vidyadharas in this matter.

## Introduction 35 However, according to destiny, everything happens as it
should. Rama, after stringing the bow, marries Sita. King Dasharatha is very
pleased with Kekaya's skill in warfare and grants her her desired boon. This
leads to her detachment. The opportunity to give Rama the kingdom arises.
Kekaya's rebellious spirit surges, and she demands that her son Bharata be given
the kingdom. Dasharatha, bound by his promise to grant her a boon, agrees to
Kekaya's request. Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita leave for the forest. The
lamentations of Rama and Lakshmana's mothers and the bitter criticisms of the
people do not deter King Dasharatha from his truth. After Rama's departure, he
takes initiation and seeks self-liberation. In this episode, Valmiki criticizes
King Dasharatha for his lust for Kekaya, but Ravishena, in his portrayal of
Rama's father, does not allow anything to be said that would make him fall from
the pinnacle of glory.  [4] Kekaya Kekaya is a woman skilled in all arts.
Acharya Ravishena has dedicated an entire chapter to describing her skills. Her
son's name is Bharata. She is a complete scholar of psychology. When Rama and
Lakshmana are married with great pomp and ceremony in Mithila, she understands
Bharata's state of mind and tells King Dasharatha in private to arrange
Bharata's marriage to the daughter of Kanak, Janak's brother. King Dasharatha
does as Kekaya commands. Although Kekaya's heart is filled with jealousy towards
her co-wife, she later regrets her actions. She goes to the forest with Bharata
and many other vassals to bring Rama and Lakshmana back. She pleads and begs,
but Rama does not budge. Instead, he explains the situation and reinstates
Bharata as king. Kekaya, repenting her actions, returns.  [5] King Janak Janak,
the king of Mithila, is Sita's father. He is very wise and protective of his
self-respect. Due to Narada's playfulness, Bhamandala, a Vidyadhara who was
Janak's son born from a previous life, saw Sita's portrait and was captivated by
her. A Vidyadhara, taking the form of a magical horse, enters Janak's court. The
Vidyadhara says, "You should marry off your daughter." But Janak, with courage,
says, "I have already promised Sita to Dasharatha's son." In this episode,
Janak's self-respect is evident as he criticizes the earth-bound beings and the
Vidyadharas. In the presence of the Vidyadharas, he scolds them, saying, "If the
Vidyadharas are proud of their ability to fly in the sky, then even crows fly in
the sky. If the Vidyadharas are superior, then why don't they take birth as
Tirthankaras?" Acharya Ravishena's immediate outburst is very intriguing.
Finally, Janak accepts the condition of stringing the Vajravart bow and returns
to Mithila. The Swayamvara takes place, Rama strings the bow, and he marries
Sita. The Vidyadharas return with their faces downcast. Bhamandala, angered by
his father's silence, decides to abduct Sita and comes with his army. But
remembering his lineage, his heart changes. He hears about his past life from a
sage. In Ayodhya, Bhamandala meets his sister Sita. King Dasharatha summons
Janak. Who can describe the joy that King Janak and Queen Videha experience at
the reunion with their son born from a previous life after a long separation?
Yet, the stream of affection that Acharya Ravishena pours out at that time is...

36   In the Padma Purana   The heart-wrenching nature of the story is
extraordinary. After this, King Janaka of Mithila sets out for conquest with
Kanaka, along with Bhamaṇḍala.   [6] Rāma   Rāma is the rightful son of Queen
Kausalya, the undefeated wife of King Daśaratha. He is the protagonist of this
text. By nature, he is simple and valiant. King Daśaratha, desiring to renounce
worldly life, prepares to take initiation, but Bharata wishes to renounce before
him. Father Daśaratha and Rāma try to explain to him, and Rāma, with the
affection and tenderness befitting his importance, persuades Bharata. Somehow,
Bharata calms down.   Preparations for Rāma's coronation are made. Kekaya wishes
to crown her son Bharata. Due to his promise, Daśaratha feels compelled. When
Rāma learns of this, he immediately departs for the forest with equanimity. "Our
father is the rightful king; we must obey his command," reflects Rāma, and there
is no turmoil in his heart. Although a seed of rebellion arises in Lakṣmaṇa's
heart, thinking their father is unjustly swayed by a woman, he remains silent
after witnessing Rāma's calmness.   When Rāma is called for the coronation, no
signs of joy appear on his face, and when he receives the order to go to the
forest, no mark of sorrow shows. Rāma departs for the forest with Sītā and
Lakṣmaṇa, yet his heart harbors not even a trace of resentment toward Bharata.
King Amitavīrya, campaigning against Bharata, becomes known. When Rāma learns
this, he secretly attempts to protect Bharata. At that time, he openly speaks to
Lakṣmaṇa, Sītā, and Lakṣmaṇa's brothers, delivering a long discourse that
reveals there is none like those who, like clouds in the night, conceal
themselves yet do good for others. Consequently, he enters Amitavīrya's court
disguised as a dancer, first enchanting him with his art, then defeating him. In
the yajnashālā of Kapila the Brahmin, weary Rāma wishes to rest but is met with
such hostility by the Brahmin that he sets off straight for the forest. Although
Lakṣmaṇa, enraged, wishes to overpower Kapila, there is no sign of diminishment
in Rāma's seriousness. He explains to Lakṣmaṇa beautifully.   Rāma's stay in the
city created by the Yākṣas and his rescue of the same Kapila Brahmin reminds one
of Sudāma's story. After Sītā's abduction, despite some agitation within Rāma,
there arises a time during the Rāma-Rāvaṇa war when some people request Rāma's
command to obstruct Rāvaṇa; Rāma disapproves, considering such an act abhorrent.
Victory is attained in battle. Rāma says, "Brother! Enmity toward Rāvaṇa was
only until death, now what is the reason for hostility?" Saying this, he
performs the last rites and advises everyone. By saying, "This is how it is
meant to be," he pacifies them all. He assumes the throne. Due to fear of public
opinion, Sītā is abandoned. Rāma remains sorrowful within like a covered pot,
while outwardly everything continues as usual. Thus we see that Rāma, despite
suffering, desires to uphold societal norms, earning him the name of Maryādā
Puruṣottama in the world. He orders Sītā for the Agni Parīkṣā, yet upon seeing
the towering flames, he becomes overwhelmed with compassion and says to
Lakṣmaṇa, "Lakṣmaṇa! May Sītā not get burned!" After the death of Lakṣmaṇa, his
love makes him almost mad for six months. Afterward, he becomes alert and
assumes initiation. In the meantime, Sītā completes her penance and takes birth
in the celestial realm of Acyuta. She is seen to be very composed in her efforts
to distract him with her changeable nature, in the mastery of the disguise arts.
Upon the return of Vibhīṣaṇa, Maṇḍodarī, and others to Ayodhya...

The introduction tries but all is in vain. After all, only those who attain
**Keval Jnana** become consumers of the path of liberation. Every event in
Rama's life and each of his actions are meant to elevate humanity. This is why
even after such a long interval, Rama remains the object of faith for everyone.
[7] Sita Sita, the daughter of Janaka, is the ideal wife of Rama. If Rama is an
ocean of seriousness, then Sita is a river of compassion. Sita is famous for her
character. When Sita sees Lakshmana and his brothers agitated against King
Amitaviry, she delivers a profound discourse. Rama supports her and tells
Lakshmana that what Sita has said is heart-touching, full of foresight, and
worthy of consideration. Lakshmana tightly binds the enemy of Vajrakarma,
Singhordar, and throws him before Rama and Sita. Seeing his condition, the
tenderness of a woman bursts forth through her words, making Singhordar tremble.
37 Indeed This is In the Dandaka forest, on the banks of the Karnarava river,
Sita prepares food. Seeing the arrival of the **Charan** and **Riddhi-dhari**
sages, her joy knows no bounds. She shows Rama the sages and, with devotion,
offers them food. The machinations of Chandranakha become the cause of Sita's
abduction. Ravana, through deceit, abducts Sita. In Ravana's Ashoka Vatika,
various temptations are presented before Sita, but she rejects them all. With
the vow, "Until Rama's message arrives, I will abstain from food and water," she
sits like a goddess. Hanuman arrives with Rama's message. His joy knows no
bounds. War ensues, Ravana is killed, Sita is reunited with Rama, and upon
returning to Ayodhya, Sita becomes pregnant after some time. Fearing public
opinion, Rama sends her away to a dense forest. Even then, not a single word
against Rama escapes her lips. She says, "It is the fault of my destiny." She
sends a message through Lakshmana, "Just as you have abandoned me due to
people's words, do not abandon the **Lokottara Dharma**. **Samyagdrishti** men
do not struggle with external causes but with their inner causes." This is why
Sita, even in the face of this great humiliation, saw her own fault, not Rama's.
What would she do alone in a deserted forest? Rama did not even consider this.
He takes Sita home as his sister, and there, Sita, through her valiant sons,
reveals the identity of Rama and Lakshmana to her valiant father. Sita undergoes
the fire ordeal. Lakshmana returns. The pregnant woman is alone. Hearing Sita's
lament, King Vajranjangh arrives there. She gives birth to twin sons. The sons
are raised with great love. | They introduce themselves by fighting their father
and defeating him. Narada arrives, and this reunion of father and sons fills the
heart with emotion. Due to Sita's **Sati** character, the fire pit becomes a
pool of water. This divine miracle spreads the glory of Sita's character
everywhere. Rama says, "Beloved, let's go home," but Sita says, "I have seen
home, now I will see the forest." She goes to the forest and becomes an
**Aryika**. Sita's pure soul, through the influence of **Tap**, becomes **Prati-
Indra** in the **Achyut** heaven. In this way, we find Sita as an ideal woman.
[8] Lakshmana Lakshmana is the son of Queen Sumitra, wife of King Dasharatha. He
has a natural love for Rama. Behind this love, we find Lakshmana sacrificing all
his happiness. Seeing Rama ready for exile, Lakshmana follows him. Although
initially, he feels some resentment towards his father, he later finds
satisfaction in thinking, "My elder brother understands what is right and wrong.
My duty is to go with him."

## English Translation:  **38** In the forest exile, Lakshmana takes utmost care
of Rama and Sita's well-being. He arranges for their food and other necessities.
He is an embodiment of valor, with no trace of fear in his heart. He is
completely devoted to Rama's commands. If there is any talk of marriage or other
such matters at any king's court during the exile, he clearly states, "Ask my
elder brother." During the war in Lanka, when Lakshmana is injured, Rama is
deeply distressed and weeps in sorrow. However, his grief is alleviated by
bathing in the waters of the Vishalya river. He obtains Ravana's chakra and uses
it to destroy Ravana. Through his conquests, he establishes his dominion over
the three divisions of Bharat. He is so devoted to Rama that he leaves his body
only upon hearing the false news of Rama's death. Although he has a fiery
nature, his fierceness is considered admirable in the presence of his elder
brother, who is an ocean of composure.  **[9] Bharat** King Bharat is the son of
Dasharatha and Kaikeyi. He is far removed from his mother's deceit and
pettiness. Kaikeyi did everything to make him king, but he refused to accept the
throne. He is always seen with a melancholic expression, longing for home.
During Rama's exile, he diligently ruled the kingdom. He is a protector of
social conduct and decorum. After Rama's return from exile, he renounced worldly
life and embraced asceticism.  **[10] Hanuman** Hanuman's association with
Rama's story is like a jewel-studded ornament. Valmiki's description of Hanuman
is incongruous and an inadequate portrayal of a great soul. He is the crown
jewel of the Vanara lineage, a Tadbhava-Moksha-gami (one who is destined for
liberation) Vidhyadhara (celestial being). Describing him as a mere monkey is an
unwise and unappealing choice. His father is Pavananjay (the wind god) and his
mother is Anjana. Anjana endured immense suffering for 22 years due to her
husband's absence, and later faced the harsh treatment of her mother-in-law,
Ketumati, in the forest. Reading about her hardships would move any
compassionate person to tears. Acharya Ravishena's portrayal of Anjana's
character evokes a powerful stream of pathos, significantly enhancing the
grandeur of the original text. After Sita's abduction, Hanuman comes into
contact with Rama and serves him with utmost dedication until Rama's return to
Ayodhya. Hanuman is a great soul with a long lifespan.  **[11] Vibhishana**
Vibhishana is Ravana's younger brother. He is an embodiment of righteousness and
ethics. Having learned from a seer that "Ravana's death will be at the hands of
Dasharatha and Janaka's descendants," he comes to Bharat to destroy them.
However, Narada's grace ensures that Dasharatha and Janaka are informed
beforehand, so they leave their palaces and install effigies of themselves.
Vibhishana, mistaking the effigies for the real Dasharatha and Janaka, cuts off
their heads with his sword, feeling satisfied. But when his conscience awakens,
he deeply regrets his actions. When Ravana abducts Sita and takes her to Lanka,
Vibhishana tries to reason with him, urging him to release her. But Ravana
refuses to listen and even insults Vibhishana. This leads Vibhishana to leave
Ravana and join Rama. Rama is deeply impressed by Vibhishana's morality. Thus,
we see Ravana and Vibhishana, born from the same mother, as contrasting figures,
representing darkness and light respectively.

## Introduction  **The Literary Form of Padmacarita**  The language of
Padmacarita is imbued with grace and is extremely captivating. After seeing the
Padmacarita published in the Manikchand Granthamala, I initially believed that
it had a greater looseness in language compared to Valmiki Ramayana. However,
when I compared it with the manuscripts, the pure text came to light, and my
belief was eradicated. The poet has done a remarkable job in describing the
forest, river, army, and war. The description of Chitrakoot mountain, Ganga
river, and seasons like spring, as done by Acharya Ravishena, is not seen even
in epics. The introduction is getting lengthy, otherwise, I would have presented
all those verses before the readers where the poet's pen has done wonders. After
reading Vimal Suri's 'Paumchariy', when we read Ravishena's Padmacarita, it
becomes clear how he has made his work so elegant and suitable for poetry.
**This Translation and Acknowledgement**  In the introduction of Mahapurana, I
wrote that in the Digambar Jain sect, Mahapurana, Padmapurana, and
Harivanshpurana, all three are the crown jewels of Purana literature. While
experiencing joy in editing and translating Mahapurana, I had drawn the
attention of society towards the editing and publication of the remaining two
Puranas. It is a matter of joy that the organizers of the Bharatiya Gyanpeeth
liked my point, and they agreed to publish these two Puranas from Gyanpeeth.
Pandit Foolchandji, a connoisseur of Jain principles and a compassionate
scholar, also drew the attention of the organizers of Gyanpeeth towards this.
Therefore, I am very grateful to all these great souls. The editing of the book
cannot be done without manuscripts, so I wrote to my fellow scholar friend
Pandit Parmanandji Delhi for manuscripts. He brought two manuscripts from the
Delhi repositories, one with Shri Chandra's annotations and one from his
personal library, 'Paumchariy', and came to Sagar himself. The remaining two
manuscripts were also obtained from Bombay and Jaipur, so I am very grateful to
those great souls who provided this resource material. I have taken textual
variations based on four manuscripts and one printed copy. This time, I had to
work alone in taking textual variations, so it took a lot of time and effort.
From the beginning to the 28th chapter, I prepared the manuscript of the
original verses myself, but due to the strict demand of the authorities of the
'B' manuscript to send it quickly, I had to mark the textual variations of other
books on the printed original copy from Manikchand Granthamala. Book editing is
a practice of literary service. Scholars can do it according to their
convenience, and then someone like me, who has to be constantly involved in many
other tasks, takes a little longer. In the meantime, the repeated demand to send
it quickly from the authorities of the manuscripts starts to bother. I consider
it better if their manuscript is used in the creation of a book rather than
being kept in the shelves of Saraswati Bhavan. Thus, I have made full use of the
manuscript for the time it was received, and I express my sincere gratitude to
the senders and protectors of those manuscripts. The eleventh chapter of
Padmacarita is full of philosophical ideas. I did not understand the meaning of
three or four verses, which Pandit Foolchandji has explained, so I am grateful
to him.  Writing an introduction requires historical knowledge, and I consider
myself completely ignorant in this subject. Whatever has been written in the
introduction is based on the knowledge of the learned scholar Shri Nathuramji
Premi, Bombay.

Padma Purana, This work is based on the Ramayana story written by Mित्रवर वं.
परमानन्दजी शास्त्री and Dr. Reverend Father Kamil Bulke M.J.M.A., D.Phil., Head
of the Hindi Department, St. Xavier's College Ranchi. In many places, we have
adopted their words, so I express my gratitude to these scholars. The Hindi
translation by the poet Daulatramji is widely circulated in the Jain community.
There is hardly any Jain temple where this commentary on the Padma Purana is not
found. Although this commentary is not perfect, it is written with a simple
approach, but it has provided significant help in translation and connecting the
story. Therefore, I express my deep gratitude to the late poet Daulatramji. I am
a very ignorant and insignificant human being, so it is possible that there are
errors in the editing and translation. Therefore, I apologize to the scholars
for this. 40 Sagar Phalguna Shukla 3. Veer Nirvana 2284  }  Vinit - Pannalal

## The Padma Purana: A Summary of Chapters 5-8  **Chapter 5**  This chapter
briefly describes the four great lineages: 1) Ikshvaku, 2) Rishi or Chandra, 3)
Vidyaadhara, and 4) Hari. It focuses on the Vidyaadhara lineage, specifically
mentioning the sages Vidyudh and Sanjayant. It also includes descriptions of
Ajitanatha Bhagwan, Sagar Chakravarti, Purnadhan, Sulochana, Sahasranayan, and
Meghvahan. The chapter details the animosity between Meghvahan and Sahasranayan
in their previous lives. It concludes with the story of how the demons Bheem and
Subheem helped Meghvahan acquire the Rakshas Dweep (Demon Island) and the
expansion of the Rakshas lineage.  **Chapter 6**  This chapter provides a
detailed account of the Vanar (monkey) lineage.  **Chapter 7**  This chapter
narrates the birth of Indra Vidyaadhara in the city of Rathnapura, the capital
of King Sahasrar. It describes his influence, power, and achievements.
**Chapter 8**  This chapter focuses on the demon king Mali, ruler of Lanka, and
his conflict with Indra. It describes their battle, Mali's death, the emergence
of the Lokapalas (Guardians of the World), and Vaishravana's residence in Lanka.
It also recounts how Sumali, defeated by Indra, settled in Alankarpur and
fathered a son named Ratna Shrava. Ratna Shrava's wife, Caikasi, gave birth to
Dasanan, Kumbhakarna, Chandranakha, and Vibhishan. The chapter further details
how Vaishravana, witnessing their aerial journey, helped them acquire various
skills. It also describes how the Anavrit Yaksha (Uncovered Yaksha) caused
trouble, but Dasanan and his siblings remained steadfast and mastered many
skills. The chapter concludes with the rise of Dasanan's influence within the
Rakshas lineage.  **Chapter 8 (Continued)**  This chapter continues with the
story of King May, ruler of Asursangeetnagar, and his daughter Mandodari. It
describes Mandodari's marriage to Dasanan. The chapter then narrates Dasanan's
water-play with six thousand maidens in the Vapi (pond) built on the Meghrav
mountain and his subsequent marriage to them. It also describes the marriages of
Kumbhakarna and Vibhishan. The chapter concludes with Kumbhakarna's destruction
of Vaishravana's cities, Vaishravana's complaint to Sumali, Dasanan's harsh

## The Padma Purana:  **Chapter Thirteen:** Indra, bound by Ravana, is freed by
his father Sahasraraka in Ravana's court. Indra shows humility towards
Sahasraraka. Indra sits in a Jain temple, where he encounters the Nirvanasangama
Muni. Indra inquires about his past lives, receives initiation, and attains
Nirvana.  **Chapter Fourteen:** Ravana returns from Mount Meru with his
entourage. On the way, on the Suvarnagiri mountain, Anantbal Muni attains
Kevalgyan. He describes the Dharma, stating, "I will not force a woman who does
not desire me." Ravana accepts this vow.  **Chapter Fifteen:** The story of
Hanuman. In Aditya-pur, King Prahlad and his wife Ketumati have a son,
Pavananjay. The chapter describes King Mahendra on Mount Dantagiri (also known
as Mahendra-giri). Due to a heart-wrenching incident, Mahendra's queen gives
birth to Anjana. The chapter details the marriage of Pavananjay and Anjana,
including the incident where Mishrakeshi, a messenger, sows discord between
Pavananjay and Anjana.  **Chapter Sixteen:** Anjana's suffering due to
separation from Pavananjay. Ravana fights with Varuna, and Pavananjay joins the
battle. On the way, he sees a Chakwai bird mourning for its mate at Manasarovar,
reminding him of Anjana's plight. He secretly goes to her. A friend informs
Anjana of Pavananjay's arrival. Pavananjay apologizes and they reunite. The
chapter describes their love and intimacy.  **Chapter Seventeen:** Anjana's
pregnancy becomes evident, and Ketumati accuses her of disgrace and throws her
out. Anjana goes to her father's house, but he refuses to shelter her after
learning about her pregnancy. Anjana, accompanied by her friend Vasantmalini,
goes to a forest and reaches a mountain. They encounter a Muni who tells them
about their past lives. The Muni consoles them and leaves. Anjana and her friend
stay in a cave. A lion approaches, but a Gandharva protects them. The Gandharva
plays music. Anjana gives birth to a son. A Vidhyadhara named Prati-Surya
arrives and they meet. An astrologer predicts the future of Hanuman based on his
birth chart. They all travel in a flying chariot with Prati-Surya. Hanuman falls
from the chariot, shattering a rock.

## The Padma Purana, Composed by Acharya Shrimad Ravishena  **First Chapter**
**Perfect, Complete, and Meaningful, the Cause of Perfection is Supreme. It is a
treatise on Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct.** ||1||  I bow to
the Great Hero, Mahavira, whose saffron-colored hair, like rays of light, adorn
the crowns of the Indra, and who is the source of auspiciousness in all three
worlds. ||2||  I bow to the first Tirthankara of the descending time cycle,
Rishabha Jinendra, the best among the Jinas, the Yogi, the creator of all
knowledge, and the self-existent. ||3||  I bow to Ajitanatha, the victor over
all internal and external enemies, and to Sambhavanatha, who bears the
meaningful name, from whom peace (sham) is attained. ||4||  I bow to Abhinandan,
who brings joy to the entire world, and to Sumatinatha Jinendra, the holder of
Right Knowledge, who refutes other doctrines. ||5||  I bow to Padma Prabha,
whose radiance is like the lotus blossoms bathed in the rays of the rising sun,
and to Supaashva, the omniscient, whose ribs were very beautiful. ||6||  I bow
to the supreme Chandra Prabha, whose body shone like the full moon of the autumn
season, and to Pushpadanta, whose teeth were radiant like blooming white lotus
flowers. ||7||  I bow to Sheetalanatha Jinendra, who was cool, the giver of
peaceful meditation, and to Shreyans, the auspicious one, the teacher of Dharma.
||8||  **The essence of the Padma Purana is according to the Shruti, which is
the eternal knowledge, and it is the repository of infinite virtues of
knowledge, bliss, and consciousness.** - Daulatramji  **Those who are self-
fulfilled, whose grace fulfills the desires of the noble souls, who expound
Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct, whose saffron-colored hair,
like rays of light, adorn the crowns of the Indras, and who are the source of
auspiciousness in all three worlds, to such Mahavira, I bow.** ||1-2||  **Those
who were Yogis, the creators of all knowledge, and self-existent, to such
Rishabha Jinendra, the first Tirthankara of the descending time cycle, I bow.**
||3||  **Those who have conquered all internal and external enemies, to such
Ajitanatha, and those who bear the meaningful name, from whom peace (sham) is
attained, to such Sambhavanatha, I bow.** ||4||  **Those who bring joy to the
entire world, to such Abhinandan, and those who are the holders of Right
Knowledge, and who refute other doctrines, to such Sumatinatha Jinendra, I
bow.** ||5||  **Those whose radiance is like the lotus blossoms bathed in the
rays of the rising sun, to such Padma Prabha, and those whose ribs were very
beautiful, to such Supaashva, the omniscient, I bow.** ||6||  **Those whose body
shone like the full moon of the autumn season, to such supreme Chandra Prabha,
and those whose teeth were radiant like blooming white lotus flowers, to such
Pushpadanta, I bow.** ||7||  **Those who were cool, the givers of peaceful
meditation, to such Sheetalanatha Jinendra, and those who were auspicious, the
teachers of Dharma, to such Shreyans, I bow.** ||8||

I bow to the glorious Shreyansanath Bhagwan, who taught the Dharma. ||8||  I bow
to Vasupujya Bhagwan, who was the lord of the righteous and was worshipped by
Kubera, and to Vimala Nath Bhagwan, who was free from the impurities of the root
of birth, such as false beliefs and other defilements. ||9||  I bow to Anantnath
Jinendra, who possessed infinite knowledge and whose vision was extremely
beautiful, to Dharmanath Swami, who was the permanent foundation of Dharma, and
to Shanti Nath Tirthankara, who conquered his enemies through peace. ||10||  I
bow to Kunthunath Bhagwan, who revealed the benefit for all beings, including
Kunthu, and to Aranath Jinendra, who attained infinite bliss after being
liberated from all suffering. ||11||  I bow to Mallinath Bhagwan, who was the
unparalleled wrestler to destroy the world, and to Naminath Swami, who was free
from impurities and was worshipped by all beings, and was the guru of both gods
and demons. ||12||  I bow to the twenty-second Tirthankara, Arishtanemi, who was
like a wheel (nemi) to destroy the heavy burden of suffering (arisht), and who
possessed extraordinary radiance, and to Parshvanath Bhagwan, who was the lord
of all beings and near whom the king of snakes (Dharanendra) sat. ||13||  I bow
to Muni Suvratnath Bhagwan, who taught the highest vows, who destroyed the
defects of hunger, thirst, etc., and whose tirtha (pilgrimage site) gave rise to
the auspicious story of Padma (Ramachandra). ||14||  I bow again and again with
my mind, speech, and body to all other great beings, including the Ganadharas
and other Muni Rajas. ||15||  Thus, I will narrate the story of Ramachandra,
whose chest was embraced by Padma (Lakshmi or the lotus symbol), whose face was
like a blooming lotus, who possessed vast merit, who was wise, who was the
embodiment of infinite virtues, and who had noble and excellent actions.
Although only a Shruta Kevali is capable of narrating his story, even a small
person like me is narrating this excellent story, which has come down through
the teachings of the Acharya tradition. The reason for this is clear. ||16-18||
Even deer walk on the path traversed by intoxicated elephants, and ordinary
warriors enter battle when led by great warriors. ||19||  Just as objects
illuminated by the sun are easily seen by people, and a gem emerges from the
mouth of a needle and enters a thread,

## First Chapter  The biography of Ramagochara, which is in the order of the
planets, is ready to be asked by my mind, which is inspired by devotion. ||21||
The great merit that is obtained from the contemplation of distinguished men, by
that very merit, my speech has attained beauty. ||22||  Speech that is adorned
with vowels like 'a' etc., but which does not convey the stories of virtuous
men, is useless for that person and only leads to the accumulation of sin.
||23||  By chanting the glories of great men, knowledge increases, pure fame
spreads, and evil goes away. ||24||  This body of living beings is filled with
diseases and is only temporary, but the fame that arises from the stories of
virtuous men lasts as long as the sun, moon, and stars. ||25||  Therefore, a
self-knowing man should make every effort to make his body permanent, that is,
to attain fame, by chanting the glories of great men. ||26||  The person who
narrates a delightful story that brings joy to the virtuous, obtains the fruits
of both worlds. ||27||  I consider those ears to be ears that listen to the
stories of virtuous men, the others are like the ears of a jester, only having
the shape of ears. ||28||  The letters that revolve in the head where the
description of the actions of virtuous men is narrated, that is the real head,
the others are like the hard outer shell of a coconut. ||29||  The tongue that
is engrossed in savoring the nectar of the chanting of virtuous men, I consider
that to be the tongue, the others are like the blade of a knife that speaks
harsh words. ||30||  The best lips are those that are engaged in chanting the
glories of virtuous men, the others are like the back of a leech that has been
eaten from the mouth of a creature called Shambuka. ||31||  The teeth that are
always stained with the association of the stories of peaceful men, those are
the real teeth, the others are like coverings that only serve to block the exit
of phlegm. ||32||  The mouth that is the main cause of attaining good fortune
and is always engaged in telling the stories of great men, that is the real
mouth, the others are filled with dirt and infested with tooth-like insects.

* In the Padma Purana, The man who speaks or listens to words of merit is truly
a man, the rest are like puppets made by a sculptor. ||34|| Just as a swan in a
mixture of milk and water drinks only the milk, so do the virtuous take only the
good from a mixture of good and bad. ||35|| And just as crows take only the meat
from the temples of elephants, leaving the pearls, so do the wicked take only
the bad from a mixture of good and bad. ||36|| Just as owls see the form of the
sun as black as a tamala leaf, so do wicked men see even blameless creations as
flawed. ||37|| Just as a net at the entrance of a lake does not stop the water
but only the debris, so do wicked men not stop the good but only hold onto the
bad, like debris. ||38|| Considering the nature of the virtuous and the wicked,
the virtuous engage in the creation of stories with the purpose of their own
benefit. ||39|| The happiness that arises in men from listening to good stories
is the self-interest of the wise, and it is the cause of earning merit. ||40||
This meaning, spoken by the Jina Vardhamana, was received by the Gautama
Ganadhara named Indra-bhuuti. Then it was received by Sudharma-acharya, the son
of Dharini. Then it was received by Prabhava, then by Kirti-dhara Acharya. After
them, it was received by the Uttara-vagmi Muni. After that, this effort of
Ravishena Acharya was revealed, having obtained his writing. ||41-42|| In this
Purana, there are seven chapters: (1) Lokasthiti, (2) Origin of lineages, (3)
Departure for the forest, (4) War, (5) Origin of Lavana-ankusha, (6) Description
of Bhavan-tara, and (7) Nirvana of Ramachandra. All seven chapters are
accompanied by many beautiful and wonderful sections. ||43-44|| To explain the
connection of the story of Ramachandra, I will also tell the brief story of
Bhagavan Mahavira, which is as follows. 1 1. Doshoktam ma. 2. Charayanti ka. 3.
Swartha ka. 4. Granthanta api 123 tamaparvanah 166 tamashloke granthakartra

## First Chapter  **This entire [text] is a ladder to the attainment of the
state of a Siddha, and is full of bliss. Therefore, O noble ones, with your
minds fixed, listen.** (101)  **[This is a] Shārdūlavikrīḍita [verse]**  **Those
who remember the great sages like Padma, etc., and with their minds free from
worldly attachments, experience supreme joy. The sins accumulated for a long
time, are shattered into thousands of pieces. What to say of those who listen to
the completely pure and bright character of [these sages]?** (102)  **This
[character] was performed by those [sages] and this [sinful] karma was destroyed
by them. Therefore, O wise and intelligent people, serve this supremely pure
character, which was served by the ancient sages, to the best of your ability.
When the right path is revealed by the sun, who with good vision will stumble?**
(103)  **Thus ends the first chapter of the Padma-charita, composed by the
Acharya Ravishena, which is known as the Ārṣa [tradition] and which outlines the

## Second Chapter  In the Jambudvipa, in the Bharat Kshetra, there is a very
bright country known as Magadha. || 1 || It is the abode of those who are full
of merit, resembling the abode of Indra, and it maintains the order of the world
through its generous conduct. || 2 || In this country, the fields, plowed by the
tips of plows, hold the roots of the earth-lotuses, as if the earth itself were
holding the best qualities. || 3 || The nearby land is always covered with
forests of trees and sugarcane, which seem to have sprung from the watering of
milk and whose leaves are swaying in the gentle breeze. || 4 || The surrounding
areas of this country are always filled with large piles of grain, like
mountains, which are arranged in a beautiful way, and are different from each
other. || 5 || The earth of this country, watered by the drops of time, is
adorned with very green cumin and jute, as if it were wearing a garland of hair.
|| 6 || The land is very fertile, adorned with the best paddy fields, and its
regions are yellow with the pods of mung and moth. || 7 || The regions are
constantly covered with the seeds of lentil or vati, whose pods have turned red
due to the heat, and it seems as if the sprouts of grass will not grow there. ||
8 || This country is endowed with fields that produce the best wheat, and it is
full of other excellent grains, free from obstacles. || 9 || The roads are
followed by herons, who raise their necks due to the greed of insects, and the
roads are guarded by cowherds who sing while sitting on the backs of large
buffaloes. || 10 || The roads are adorned with bells tied with colorful threads,
which sound very pleasant, and the cows, whose udders are overflowing with milk,
seem to be discarding the milk they have already drunk, fearing indigestion. ||
11 || The land is covered with grass, which is full of sweet juice and so
delicate that it breaks with just the breath of the mouth.

## Second Chapter  The land is white with the dust of the Ketaki flower, its
elevated regions resembling the banks of the Ganga, frequented by people.  || 14
||  In some places, the land is adorned with the verdant beauty of fields of
vegetables, while in others, it is graced by coconut trees, savored by the
forest guardians. || 15 ||  The land is filled with pomegranate groves, their
flowers resembling the beaks of parrots and the faces of monkeys, creating an
illusion. || 16 ||  The land is adorned with arbors of grapes, their leaves
smeared with the juice of the Bijaura fruit, crushed by the hands of the forest
guardians, and embellished with clusters of saffron flowers.  Here, travelers
find solace, sleeping peacefully after enjoying the taste of fruits and the
coolness of water. These arbors resemble the resting places of the forest
goddess. || 17-18 ||  The land is abundant with date palm trees, their fruits
plucked and consumed by travelers, and with banana trees, their fruits scattered
by monkeys. || 19 ||  The land is adorned with lakes, their banks covered with
dense forests of Arjuna trees. The lakes resound with the cries of herds of
cows, their waters teeming with leaping fish, their eyes wide open, resembling
blooming white lotuses. The lakes are adorned with waves, their movements
resembling a dance, and with swans, their melodious calls echoing like a song.
The banks of these lakes are frequented by joyous crowds, and the lakes
themselves are adorned with lotuses, their beauty enhanced by the presence of
cranes. || 20-23 ||  The entire land is filled with flocks of sheep, camels, and
calves, their beautiful bodies engaged in playful activities, protected by
benevolent guardians. || 24 ||  Their backs are smeared with saffron paste, as
if to attract the horses of the sun god's chariot, and their faces, with their
playful movements, seem to be blowing the wind. || 25 ||

The land is filled with groups of mares, as if they are teaching their foals the
speed of motion.  [26]  The land is sometimes very white, with flocks of swans
that seem like a great mass of human virtues, and whose voices attract the minds
of people. [27]  The sky is always filled with the sound of drums, mixed with
the sounds of music and peacocks. [28]  The land is always adorned with virtuous
people, who are as pure as the white circle of the autumn moon, like pearls, and
clever at giving joy. [29]  The land is always accessible to people, because it
is filled with great householders who have satisfied groups of travelers with
food and other provisions, and who are like the best trees because of their
fruits. [30]  The land is inhabited by great people who are like the peaks of
the Himalayas, covered with musk and other fragrant substances, and various
kinds of clothes. [31]  In that land, the defects of false vision are removed by
the collyrium of Jain teachings, and the forest of sin is burned by the fire of
the great sages' austerities. [32]  In that Magadha country, there is a city
called Rajagriha, beautiful in all directions, and fragrant with flowers, as if
it were the youth of the world. [33]  That city of Rajagriha always attracts the
mind, like the inner palace of Dharma, the god of justice, because just as the
inner palace of Dharma is filled with thousands of queens, whose bodies are
adorned with saffron, so too is the city of Rajagriha adorned with thousands of
queens, whose bodies are adorned with saffron.  [34]  The outskirts of that city
are adorned with small fans, and the wind makes the yak-tails tremble, so the
city is like the splendor of Indra, because the outskirts of Indra's palace are
also adorned with small fans, and the wind makes the yak-tails tremble there.

## The Second Chapter  **36.** The city, as if desiring to conquer the city of
Tripura, was not afflicted by the pain inflicted by the arrows of Shiva, but by
the pleas of the wealthy. The people of this city were all prosperous and
enjoyed great happiness.  **37.** The city seemed to be adorned with rows of
white palaces, gleaming with lime, as if it were built with moonstones set in
silver.  **38.** The city was always filled with the sound of the ornaments of
intoxicated women, making it seem like a second Alka Puri, the city of Kubera.
**39.** The best of the sages considered it a place of penance, the courtesans a
temple of love, the dancers a dance hall, and the enemies a city of Yama, the
god of death.  **40.** The warriors considered it a home for heroes, the beggars
a place of wish-fulfilling gems, the students a house of their teacher, and the
prisoners a city of rogues.  **41.** The learned in music and the arts
considered it the city of Gandharva, and those eager to learn science considered
it the abode of Vishwakarma, the divine architect.  **42.** The righteous
considered it a place of good company, the merchants a land of profit, and those
seeking refuge a safe haven built of diamond wood.  **43.** The news-bearers
considered it a mysterious place like the lair of the Asuras, the clever
considered it a gathering of fools, and those who followed the right path
considered it the fruit of a good deed.  **44.** The bards considered it a place
of festivals, the lustful a city of Apsaras, and the happy a realm of Siddhas.
**45.** The women of this city, though they were called Matangagamini, meaning
they walked with the Chandals, were still considered virtuous. They were
beautiful like elephants, and adorned with the virtue of chastity. Though they
were dark-skinned, they were radiant like rubies. They were also fair-skinned,
and possessed great wealth.  **46.** Their bodies were made of moonstones, and
they were as delicate as the Sirisha tree. They were inaccessible to snakes, and
their bodies were not made of false fabric.  **35.** The doors and fly whisks
kept shaking.

## Chapter 14  **47.** The women were endowed with great beauty, and were eager
to speak sweetly. Their faces were radiant and cheerful, and their movements
were free from any frivolity.  **48.** Though poor, they possessed the wealth of
a husband, and though round in form, they were tall and graceful. They were
beautiful, well-behaved, and possessed a bright future.  **49.** The city had a
rampart like the mountain at the end of the world, and a moat like the ocean,
surrounding it.  **50.** In that city lived a renowned king named Shrenik, who,
like Indra, bore a bow that could control all the castes (or, who wore a bow of
all colors).  **51.** He was of a benevolent nature, like Mount Sumeru, and his
mind was always fearful of transgressing the limits of righteousness, like the
ocean.  **52.** King Shrenik was like the moon in his mastery of the arts, like
the earth in his ability to sustain the world, like the sun in his brilliance,
and like Kubera in his wealth.  **53.** He protected all the worlds with his
valor, yet his mind was always guided by righteousness. He was united with
Lakshmi, but never tainted by the vice of pride.  **54.** Though he had
conquered all his enemies, he never neglected his military training. He remained
calm in times of adversity, and honored those who bowed before him.  **55.** He
considered only the virtuous, free from faults, as jewels, and regarded stones
as mere transformations of the earth.

The second chapter deals with the great means of attaining liberation, which are
actions involving charity. He considered a large insect to be equal to an
elephant in its pride. ||56|| He had great love for fame, which was the foremost
of all things. He considered perishable life to be like withered grass. ||57||
He always considered the directions that brought wealth to be his adornment. He
was always averse to women. ||58|| He considered the bow bent by the string of
virtue to be his helper. He never considered a group of servants who were
satisfied with food alone and were harmful to be helpful. ||59|| In his kingdom,
even the wind did not take anything from anyone, let alone others. Similarly,
even a group of wicked animals did not engage in violence, let alone humans.
||60|| The actions of Hari, i.e., Vishnu, were to destroy the bull-killer, i.e.,
Vrishaasura, but his actions were not to destroy the bull-killer, i.e., Dharma.
Similarly, the glory of Mahadeva, i.e., Shiva, was to cause suffering to the
family of King Daksha, but his glory was not to cause suffering to the group of
clever people. ||61|| Just as Indra's actions were to destroy the lineage, i.e.,
mountains, his actions were not to destroy the lineage, i.e., family. And just
as the king of the south, Yama, had a great love for punishment, he did not have
a great love for punishment. ||62|| Just as Varuna's wealth was free from
crocodiles and other wicked aquatic creatures, his wealth was not protected from
wicked people, i.e., everyone could enjoy it. And just as it is futile to obtain
the proximity of Kubera, i.e., the best treasure, it was not futile to obtain
his proximity, i.e., the treasure of virtuous people. ||63|| Just as the
Buddha's vision, i.e., the philosophy of reality, was devoid of wealth, his
vision, i.e., realization, was not devoid of wealth. And just as the moon is
also affected and destroyed by the dark fortnight, his was not affected and
destroyed by great faults. ||64|| The beggars could not attain the fullness of
his virtue of charity, i.e., there were not enough beggars to receive all the
charity he wanted to give. The scriptures could not attain the fullness of his
intellect, i.e., his intellect was very great and the scriptures were few.
Similarly, Saraswati could not attain the fullness of his poetic power. ||65||

## The Padma Purana:  **Verse 66:** His valorous deeds could not exhaust his
glory, his efforts could not reach the limit of his enthusiasm, the directions
could not contain his fame, and numbers could not encompass his wealth of
virtues.  **Verse 67:** The hearts of all beings on earth could not contain
their love for him, the arts could not exhaust his skill, and his enemies could
not fathom his power and brilliance.  **Verse 68:** How can we, who are so
insignificant, describe the virtues of King Shrenik, whose perfect knowledge is
discussed in the assembly of Indra?  **Verse 69:** He was like a thunderbolt to
the arrogant enemies, but he treated the virtuous, who were rich in penance,
with the gentleness of a cane.  **Verse 70:** He protected the entire earth with
his strong arm. The fortifications and moats around the city were merely for
show.  **Verse 71:** His wife's name was Chelna. She was adorned with the
ornaments of virtue, pure in her right faith, and a devotee of the teachings of
the Shravakas.  **Verse 72:** Once, the great Mahavira, who was blessed with
infinite wealth and whose feet were worshipped by gods and demons, arrived near
the city of Rajagriha.  **Verse 73:** Even in his mother's womb, he possessed
the three knowledges - Mati, Shruta, and Avadhi, and enjoyed a pleasure equal to
that of Indra.  **Verse 74:** Before and after his birth, at the command of
Indra, Kubera filled his father's house with a shower of jewels.  **Verse 75:**
At his birth ceremony, the gods, along with Indra, celebrated with great pomp on
the peak of Mount Meru.  **Verse 76:** He shook Mount Meru effortlessly with his
toes and received the name "Mahavira" from Indra.  **Verse 77:** Even as a
child, he performed deeds beyond his age. His body was sustained by the nectar
that Indra had poured on his toe.

The second chapter was served by beautiful celestial princes, sent by Indra, who
were like young boys, with charming humility.  ||7||  With them, the parents,
the family, and the three worlds attained supreme happiness. ||79||  At his
birth, all the powerful kings who were his father's long-time enemies became
submissive, bowing their heads. ||80||  The courtyard of his father's palace was
always filled with chariots, intoxicated elephants, horses swift as the wind,
caravans of camels laden with gifts, and many kings, lords of their realms,
eager to see the king of kings, abandoning their umbrellas, fly whisks, and
vehicles. ||81-83||  Just as a lotus is not attached to water, so his mind was
not attached to pleasurable objects, being free from the taint of karma. ||84||
Knowing that all wealth is fleeting like lightning, he renounced the world,
becoming self-enlightened, and his initiation was attended by the gods of the
heavens. ||85||  He worshipped the three jewels - right faith, right knowledge,
and right conduct - and destroyed the four destructive karmas. ||86||  Having
attained omniscience, illuminating both the world and the beyond, he established
the Dharma-tirtha for the benefit of the world, and he himself became fulfilled.
||87||  Having attained all that was attainable and accomplished all that was to
be done, his every effort, like the sun, was solely for the benefit of others.
||88||  He possessed a body that was naturally free from impurities and sweat,
white as milk, with blood like red sandalwood, with a perfect form, a pleasant
fragrance, and a strong constitution, endowed with infinite strength, adorned
with beautiful marks, speaking words that were beneficial and appropriate, and a
treasure house of immeasurable virtues. ||89-90||  Within two hundred yojanas of
his dwelling, there could be no famine, no suffering of others, no excessive
rain, no drought, or any other calamity. ||91||

18 Padmapurana He who attained the supreme state of all knowledge, whose body,
like pure crystal, did not cast a shadow. ||12|| Whose eyes were serene, free
from the flicker of eyelids, whose nails, hair, and body were all of a uniform,
deep blue, and lustrous hue. ||13|| Whose heart was filled with universal
compassion, whose gentle breeze brought joy to all beings, whose very presence
was the cause of happiness in the world. ||94|| Whose presence caused all trees
to bear fruits and flowers of every season, and the earth to become like a
mirror. ||15|| Whose fragrant wind, extending for a yojana, cleansed the earth
of dust, stones, thorns, and other impurities. ||96|| Whose presence was adorned
by lightning-like flashes, accompanied by thunderous roars, and showered with
fragrant water by enthusiastic and respectful clouds. ||97|| Whose footsteps
caused lotus flowers to bloom on the earth, as he moved through the sky. ||98||
Whose presence caused the earth to be adorned with abundant fruits, humble rice,
and other crops, and to become the source of all sustenance. ||19|| Whose
presence caused the sky to become clear like a autumnal lake, and the directions
to be free from smoke and other impurities, appearing beautiful and serene.
||100|| Whose presence was adorned by a radiant Dharmachakra, shining with a
thousand rays, and having conquered the sun. ||101|| He, the Lord Vardhamana
Jina, resided on the vast and magnificent Vipulachala mountain, near Rajagriha,
where the sweet sound of numerous waterfalls filled the air, where every place
was adorned with flowers, where trees were embraced by creepers, where lions,
tigers, and other animals were absent, allowing for peaceful meditation, where
the swaying trees seemed to bow in reverence, and where the leaping waterfalls
sparkled with purity. ||102-104|| There is no end to his glory. ||91||

The second chapter  The birds' chirping seemed like a sweet conversation, the
buzzing of the bees seemed like a song of intoxication, the fragrant breeze
seemed like an embrace. The mountain peaks were adorned with a multitude of
shining metals, the mouths of lions were visible in the caves, the elephants
were seated beneath the dense trees, and the mountain covered the entire sky
with its glory. Just as Lord Vrishabhadeva was seated on the beautiful Mount
Kailasa, in the same way, Lord Vardhamana Jineendra was seated on the vast
mountain. ||102-108||  On that vast mountain, there was a land called
Samavasarana, which was one yojana in extent. ||109||  When the victorious
Vardhamana Jineendra, the conqueror of the enemy called the world, ascended the
throne in that Samavasarana land, Indra's throne trembled. ||110||  Indra
thought at that time, "By whose power has my throne trembled?" As he thought, he
knew everything through his knowledge of the past, present, and future. ||111||
Indra remembered his commander, and the commander immediately stood with folded
hands. Indra ordered him, "Inform all the gods that Lord Vardhamana Jineendra is
seated on the vast mountain, so all of you should gather and go to pay your
respects to him." ||112-113||  Then Indra himself mounted his elephant,
Airavata, which looked like a large group of autumn clouds, whose tusks were
yellowed by the impact of golden shores, which was adorned with golden garlands,
and which was surrounded by a river whose water seemed to be yellowed by the
pollen of lotuses, like Mount Kailasa itself. The elephant was adorned with the
cheeks of intoxicated bees, its fragrance filled the entire world with the
pollen of Kadamba flowers, it had a conch shell ornament near its ears, and it
seemed to be spitting out forests of lotuses with its red tongue. ||114-117||

delusion, with the sun of knowledge, the orb of your great brilliance." ||127||
"Salutations to you, O Lord, who are free from attachment, omniscient, and
great. You have reached the inaccessible shore of the ocean of existence."
||128|| "With you as the merchant, the merchants of the noble mind will reach
the abode of liberation, and they will not be robbed by the thieves of vices
along the way." ||129|| "You have opened the pure path for the Siddhas. The web
of karma has been burnt by the fire of your blazing meditation." ||130||

Second Canto The boundless and helpless ones, who are being scorched by the fire
of suffering, you are their kinsman and the supreme refuge. How can we praise
your qualities, which are beyond comparison, free from all analogies, and
accessible only to the Omniscient ones? ¹¹³¹¹  Having thus offered praise and
obeisance, he (Indra) stood with his head, knees, and the lotuses of his hands
touching the ground. ¹¹³३¹¹  In brief, the description of that place is as
follows: Indra's attendants had constructed the three-fold structure of the
assembly hall, which was made of various precious gems and excellent gold.
¹¹३५¹¹  It was endowed with four lofty gateways facing the four directions,
adorned with great pools, and covered with the radiance of jewels. ¹¹३६¹¹  That
place was embellished with the eight auspicious substances and possessed a
splendor that transcended speech. ¹¹३७¹¹  There, twelve chambers made of crystal
walls were situated in a circumambulatory path. ¹¹३८¹¹  In the first of those,
the Ganadhara monks were seated; in the second, the consorts of Indra along with
the celestial nymphs of the Kalpa-vāsin devas; in the third, the assembly of
Āryikās accompanied by the Gaṇinīs; in the fourth, the celestial nymphs of the
Jyotiṣka devas; in the fifth, the consorts of the Vyantara devas; in the sixth,
the consorts of the Bhavanavāsin devas; in the seventh, the Jyotiṣka devas; in
the eighth, the Vyantara devas; in the ninth, the Bhavanavāsin devas; in the
tenth, the Kalpa-vāsin devas; in the eleventh, the humans; and in the twelfth,
the Tiryañc beings who were free from enmity and abiding in happiness.
¹¹३९-¹¹४२¹¹  Thereafter, the mighty King Śreṇika, whose mind was filled with
wonder at the arrival of the multitude of devas, also emerged from his city.

22 Padmapurana Having abandoned his vehicle and other royal paraphernalia from
afar, he bowed to the Jina with reverence and entered his own place. || 144 ||
The compassionate Varisena, the fearless Kumar, Vijayavahana, and other princes,
having bowed with folded hands and touched their foreheads, paid homage to the
Lord. Then, with great humility, they all sat down in their respective places.
|| 145-146 || The Lord Vardhamana was seated on a throne beneath an Ashoka tree
in the Samavasarana. Its branches were made of vaidurya (blue) gems, and it was
adorned with delicate leaves. Its flowers, radiant with brilliance, filled all
directions. It was extremely beautiful, as pleasing as a Kalpa tree, and it
dispelled the sorrows of mankind. Its leaves were green and dense, and it
resembled a mountain made of various gems. His throne also produced a rainbow
from the light of various gems. It was covered with divine garments, pleasing to
the mind with its soft touch, and it obstructed the spread of the brilliance of
the gems on Indra's head. It was adorned with three umbrellas, signifying his
sovereignty over the three worlds, and it was filled with flowers showered by
the gods. It stood on the surface of the earth, adorned with fluttering chowries
held by the Yaksha king, and the sound of the Dundubhi drums echoed peacefully
from it. || 147-152 || The divine sound that emanated from the Lord transformed
into the language of beings of the three realms, and its loud voice was like the
dense roar of clouds. || 153 || In the midst of a halo that eclipsed the sun's
light, the Lord was seated. When questioned by the Ganadhara, he preached the
Dharma to the people as follows: || 154 || He said that first and foremost,
there is one reality, and then, with the distinction between Jiva and Ajiva,
there are two types of reality. Among them, too, there are two distinctions:
Siddha and Samsari. || 155 || Besides these, there are two more distinctions
among Jivas: Bhavy and Abhavy. Just as there are some grains like urad, etc.,
that ripen and mature, and some that do not ripen or mature even with effort, so
too, there are two types of Jivas: 2. Pranamam cha ma. 3. Janitendrayudhodgame
ma. 4. Parichchhanne 1. Vijayavahananama cha tatha anyanripasunanavaha ma. ma.
5. Sapim ma. 6. Jivaasca ma.   .

## Second Chapter 23  **156.**  Just as beans are divided into edible and
inedible, so too are living beings divided into two categories: **Bhavyas**
(those who can attain liberation) and **Abhavyas** (those who cannot attain
liberation).  **157.**  The second division of living beings is based on the
differences in Dharma (righteousness), Adharma (unrighteousness), etc.
**Bhavyas** are those who are destined to attain liberation, while **Abhavyas**
are not.  **158.**  The characteristic of **Bhavyas** is their faith in the
principles taught by the Jinas, while the characteristic of **Abhavyas** is
their lack of faith.  Further divisions of **Bhavyas** and **Abhavyas** are
based on the number of senses they possess: one-sensed, two-sensed, three-
sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed.  **159.**  Living beings are further
divided based on their: * **Gati** (type of birth) * **Kaya** (body) * **Yoga**
(type of karma) * **Veda** (knowledge) * **Leshya** (mental disposition) *
**Kasaya** (passions) * **Jnana** (knowledge) * **Darshan** (right view) *
**Charitra** (conduct) * **Gunasthan** (stages of spiritual progress) *
**Nisarga** (natural) and **Adhigata** (acquired) **Samyag Darshan** (right
view) * **Namadi Nikshepa** (deposits of karma)  **160.**  Living beings are
also divided based on the eight **Anuyoga** (principles): * **Sat** (existence)
* **Sankhya** (number) * **Kshetra** (space) * **Sparshan** (touch) * **Kala**
(time) * **Antar** (interior) * **Bhaava** (state of being) * **Alp** (few) and
**Bahutva** (many)  **161.**  Of these two types of living beings, **Siddhas**
(liberated souls) and **Samsaris** (bound souls), only **Samsaris** experience
suffering.  **Samsaris** mistakenly perceive the pleasures derived from the five
senses as true happiness.  **162.**  Even for a moment as short as the blink of
an eye, **Narakas** (hell beings) do not experience happiness.  **163.**
**Tiryachas** (animals) constantly experience suffering due to: * **Daman**
(suppression) * **Tadan** (punishment) * **Dovan** (exploitation) * **Vahan**
(being used as a vehicle) * **Sheeta** (cold) * **Atapa** (heat) * **Varsha**
(rain)  **164.**  **Manushyas** (humans) experience great suffering due to: *
**Priyanam ViprYogena** (separation from loved ones) * **Anishta Samagamaat**
(association with undesirable things) * **Ipsitanam Alaabhaat** (failure to
obtain desired things)  **165.**  **Devas** (gods) experience suffering due to:
* **Utkrisht Suraanam Cha Drishta Bhagam Mahagunam** (seeing the great pleasures
of superior gods) * **Chyavanaat Cha Param Duhkham** (falling from their
heavenly abode)  **166.**  When living beings in all four **Gatis** (types of
birth) are bound by great suffering, it is best to attain the **Karmabhoomi**
(human birth) and strive for **Dharma** (righteousness).  **167.**  Those who
attain the human birth but do not practice **Dharma** are like those who have
lost the nectar that has come into their hands.  **168.**  In this world filled
with countless births, it is very difficult to attain the human birth after
wandering through many births.

In the Padma Purana, it is said: "Among those who are greedy and sinful, like
the Sabaras, one is born. Even if one attains Aryadesha, one is born in a low
family. (16) Even if one is born in a good family, one may have a deformed body,
like a one-eyed or lame person. Even if one has a complete body, it is very
difficult to be free from disease. (17) Even if one attains all the good things,
like the company of virtuous people, it is difficult to have devotion to Dharma
because of the desire to enjoy worldly pleasures. (171) In this world, there are
many people who work for others and earn a living with great difficulty. They
are far from attaining wealth. (172) Some people, controlled by their tongue and
sexual desires, enter into battles that are filled with blood and the rain of
weapons. (173) Some people, burdened with the responsibility of supporting their
families, engage in the difficult task of tilling the land, causing harm to many
creatures, and are constantly oppressed by kings. (174) Thus, those who desire
happiness, whatever they do, they experience great suffering. (175) Even if one
somehow acquires wealth, one suffers greatly protecting it from thieves, fire,
water, and kings, and is always anxious. (176) Even if one has acquired and
protected wealth, one does not find peace in enjoying it, because the fire of
greed keeps burning within. (177) Even if one somehow attains devotion to Dharma
due to the influence of past good deeds, one is led back to the path of Samsara
by other wicked people. (178) Those who have been destroyed by others, destroy
others in turn, leading them astray, and follow only tradition in the name of
Dharma. (179) How can the minds of those who are attached to possessions be
purified? And how can they have a firm foundation in Dharma, which is rooted in
the purity of the mind? (180) This being, after a long time, is born as a human
being with great difficulty. (168) In that human birth, this being is mostly
born among greedy and sinful people, like the Sabaras, and other low-born
people. If by chance, it attains Aryadesha, it is born in a low family. (169) If
by chance, it is born in a good family, it may have a deformed body, like a one-
eyed or lame person. If by chance, it has a complete body, it is very difficult
to be free from disease. (170) In this way, even if one attains all the good
things, like the company of virtuous people, it is difficult to have devotion to
Dharma because of the desire to enjoy worldly pleasures. (171)

## The Second Chapter  **180.** As long as there is attachment to possessions,
there will be the oppression of living beings. Violence is the root cause of the
cycle of birth and death, and suffering is known as the cycle of birth and
death.  **181.** From the embrace of possessions, hatred and attachment arise.
Attachment and hatred are the strongest causes of suffering in the cycle of
birth and death.  **182.** Even though many beings attain Right Faith, they are
still veiled by the obscurations of conduct and cannot attain Right Conduct.
**183.** Even those who have attained Right Conduct and perform great
austerities are corrupted by the hardships and are led astray by the suffering.
**184.** Some, corrupted by hardships, practice the minor vows. Others are
content with Right Faith alone and do not observe any vows.  **185.** Some,
clinging to the well of the deep cycle of birth and death, abandon Right Faith
and embrace false beliefs.  **186.** Such beings, bound by false beliefs, wander
continuously in the cycle of birth and death, consumed by the fire of suffering.
**187.** Some, however, are great heroes with virtuous deeds who uphold Right
Conduct throughout their lives.  **188.** They attain Samadhi and, upon shedding
their bodies, attain the state of Narayana and other such states due to the
karmic residue.  **189.** Those who become Narayana are eager to inflict
suffering on others and their minds are cruel. Therefore, they experience great
suffering in the hells after death, which is difficult to overcome.  **190.**
Some, through great austerities, attain the state of Indra. Others attain the
state of Balarama, and others reside in the higher celestial realms.  **191.**
Some, with great fortitude, contemplate the sixteen causes of existence and
attain the state of a Tirthankara, which causes upheaval in the three realms.
**192.** Others, constantly engaged in the worship of Right Faith, Right
Knowledge, and Right Conduct, are liberated from the eight karmic stains within
two or three lifetimes.  **193.** They then attain the supreme state, the
incomparable abode of the liberated, and enjoy infinite, unhindered, supreme
bliss.

26 Padmapurana Then, from the lotus-like face of the Jina, Dharma emerged.
Hearing this, the humans, the animals, and the gods were filled with supreme
joy. || 195 || Some attained Anuvrata, some became Nir-ambara. With minds
troubled by the cycle of birth and death, they began to practice austerities. ||
196 || Some attained Right Faith, some, by their own strength, renounced the
actions that lead to evil. || 197 || Having heard Dharma, praised the Jina, and
prostrated themselves as per the rules, with minds established in Dharma, they
went to their respective places. || 198 || The great king Shrenika, adorned with
royal splendor, his heart filled with joy at hearing the Dharma, entered his
city. || 199 || Then, seeing the glorious radiance of the Tirthankara, the sun,
as if ashamed, wished to hide himself in the ocean. || 200 || As the sun
approached the setting point, it appeared as if it was covered with the rays of
Padmaraga gems, and it became extremely red. || 201 || The rays that always
followed the sun became dim. It is only right, for whose radiance can increase
when the master is in distress? || 202 || Then, the female chakavas looked at
the sun with tear-filled eyes. As if out of compassion, the sun slowly became
invisible. || 203 || The attachment that living beings had given up by hearing
Dharma, as if by the trickery of twilight, covered the circle of directions. ||
204 || Just as a friend, without being asked, is inclined to help people, so
too, the sun, without being asked, is inclined to help us. Therefore, the
setting sun is like a friend setting. || 205 || At that time, the lotuses were
contracting, as if they were swallowing the setting sun's dying red glow. || 206
|| It had made the vastness and height into one, and it could not be described.
Darkness appeared, as if the evil deeds of the wicked were being manifested. ||

27 The second part of the night was enveloped in deep darkness. The veil of
smoke was extinguishing the fire-like glow. The cluster of Champaka and Kshara
flowers, agitated by the gentle breeze, appeared to be the ear-ornaments of the
night. The swans, satiated with the nectar of lotuses and having their wings
cleansed by the stalks, indulged in scratching and sleep. The evening breeze,
which was the holder of the garland of Dhammilla and Mallika flowers, blew
gently, resembling the exhalation of the night. In the thickets of Kusa grass,
the assemblage of six-legged creatures took shelter. The sky, adorned with the
extremely pure disc of the moon, appeared like the collection of sublime
utterances of the Jina Lord, paying obeisance to the three worlds. The darkness
was dispelled by the moonbeams, just as the words of the ascetics are refuted by
the principles enunciated by the Jina. The moon, welcomed by the people, arose,
bearing a body that trembled as if to ward off the darkness, like the ocean of
milk. In the moonlight, the world became easily graspable, as if it had begun to
sink, weary of the darkness, into the ocean of milk. The lotuses, as if suddenly
awakened, seemed to be carrying the supreme fragrance brought by the hands of
the moon. Thus, the auspicious twilight, which enhanced the joy of the loving
couple and delighted the people, arrived.

In the Padma Purana, The fragrance of the best flowers emanating from the
windows. The courtesans, seated nearby, were captivating with their melodious
songs. ||220|| A lamp, covered with crystal, was burning very close. The guards,
without any negligence, were protecting it. ||221|| The ground was adorned with
a collection of flowers. A soft pillow was placed on it. ||222|| The head of the
bed was facing the direction sanctified by the feet of the Jina. A fine, but
wide, sheet was spread over each foot. ||223|| Having completed his royal
duties, the king, who was devoted to the Jain faith, lay down comfortably on the
bed. ||224|| The king, Shrenik, saw the Jina in his dreams again and again. He
asked him about his doubts and learned the truth from him. ||225|| Then, the
king, Shrenik, was awakened by the sound of the trumpet, which dispelled the
sleep of the intoxicated elephant, echoed in the cave-like chambers of the
palace, and overpowered the thunderous roar of the mighty clouds. ||226-227||
Upon waking, he contemplated with a focused mind the virtuous deeds of the
Chakravarti and other valiant men, as spoken by the Lord Mahavira. ||228|| Then,
his mind turned to the story of Balabhadra, the bearer of the Padma, and he
began to doubt about the demons and monkeys. ||229|| He thought, "Oh! Those who
were the best of men, born in noble families, learned, and whose minds were
illuminated by knowledge, were influenced by the Jain faith. But in the worldly
scriptures, demons like Ravana are described as drinkers and eaters of fat,
blood, and flesh." ||230-231|| Ravana's brother, Kumbhakarna, was very strong
and slept continuously for six months, being overcome by deep sleep. ||232||
Even if he was trampled by intoxicated elephants, his ears were filled with
cauldrons of hot oil, and the sound of drums and conch shells was made, he would
not wake up until the time was complete. ||233-234|| When he woke up, he was
tormented by hunger and thirst, and with his huge belly, he would eat even
elephants and other difficult-to-digest things. ||235||

## Second Chapter  The one who holds the vow, Kumbhakarna, when he woke up, was
so overwhelmed by hunger and thirst that he would eat whatever he saw, including
elephants. Thus, he was very formidable. || 235 ||  Having been satiated by the
animals, humans, and gods, he would fall asleep again, and no other man could
stay near him. || 236 ||  Oh! How strange it is that the foolish poets, who
create wicked and flawed texts, have depicted the character of the Vidyaadhara
prince in such a repulsive way. || 237 ||  This kind of text, which narrates all
this, is known as the Ramayana. It is said that listening to it destroys all the
sins of the listener instantly. || 238 ||  For one whose mind is eager to
renounce suffering, this Ramayana is like the union with fire. And for one who
desires to remove coldness, it is like the union with cold wind mixed with snow.
|| 239 ||  Just as churning water is useless for one who desires ghee, and
grinding sand is futile for one who wants oil, so too, relying on the Ramayana
is useless for one who desires to renounce sin. || 240 ||  Even in the
scriptures that depict the characters of great men, wicked people have created
the concept of Dharma Shastra. || 241 ||  The Ramayana also states that Ravana
defeated Indra, the king of the gods, by shooting arrows that pierced his heart
and dragged him by his ears. || 242 ||  Oh! Where is the lord of the gods,
Indra, and where is that insignificant human who could be reduced to ashes by
merely thinking about Indra? || 243 ||  He who had Airavata as his elephant, and
a great weapon like the thunderbolt, and who could effortlessly lift the earth
adorned with Mount Meru and the oceans. || 244 ||  How could such an Indra be
defeated by a Vidyaadhara, who was a mere human with little strength, and who
possessed knowledge? || 245 ||  It is also written that the king of the
Rakshasas, Ravana, captured Indra and kept him in his prison. He remained bound
and confined in the prison of Lanka for a long time. || 246 ||  To say such
things is like saying that a lion is killed by deer, stones are ground by sesame
seeds, a serpent is killed by a snake, and an elephant is subdued by a dog. ||
247 ||  The one who holds the vow...

30 Padmapurana Rama, who had obtained the vow, was killed by the golden monkey,
and Sugriva's elder brother, who was like his father, was killed by Janaka for
the sake of his wife. ||248|| All this is unbelievable, devoid of any logic. I
will ask the Lord Gautama, the head of the Ganadharas, tomorrow. ||249|| As the
wise king was thinking this, a great shout of victory was raised by the
prisoners as the sound of the trumpets ceased. ||250|| At that time, the long-
lived son of the family, who was near the king, woke up and, by nature, recited
this verse to the old man: "One should always ask the gurus, even if one knows
the meaning oneself, for the knowledge obtained through their confirmation gives
supreme happiness." ||251-252|| Filled with joy at this auspicious occasion, and
with his wives having performed auspicious rites, King Shrenik rose from his
bed. ||253|| Then - the king Shrenik emerged from his beautiful abode, which was
adorned with a canopy of flowers, and where the sweet humming of bees that had
emerged from their sleep filled one part of the palace, and where the pale lamps
were swaying in the cool breeze of the morning. ||254|| As he emerged, he heard
the victorious sound emanating from the excellent lips of the Vārāṅganās, whose
radiance was like that of Lakshmi, and whose hands, adorned with lotus-like
ornaments, were adorned with the beauty of lotuses. ||255|| Thus, the king
Shrenik, who had attained calmness through the influence of extremely auspicious
thoughts, and who had acquired all the auspicious feelings of the moment,
emerged from his abode, which was as radiant as a white lotus, and shone like
the sun emerging from a cluster of autumn clouds. ||256|| Thus ends the second
chapter of the Padmacharita, composed by the Acharya Ravishena, known as the
Ārṣa, which describes the anxieties of King Shrenik. ||2|| 1. From one part of
the interior of the sound. M. | 2. The sound of victory. M. |

## The Third Chapter  There, in the assembly hall, he stood, his body perfectly
composed, adorned with all ornaments, and entered the grand hall. ||1|| He was
accompanied by his ministers, who had been ushered in by the doorkeepers, their
fine garments torn by the clash of their armlets, their heads adorned with
garlands that were being buzzed over by bees, their feet touching the ground,
covered by the rays of their anklets, their bodies enveloped in the radiance of
their swaying necklaces, their minds captivated by the multitude of the king's
virtues. ||2-4||   Then, followed by those ministers, mounted on their noble
steeds, the king, Śreṇika, ascended the grand elephant, whose back was adorned
with a beautiful howdah, and proceeded towards the assembly of the Jina, Śrī
Vardhamāna. ||5||   A group of attendants, with swords in their hands, daggers
at their waists, and golden bracelets on their left arms, leaped far into the
sky, following the wind like a herd of deer, and shouted, "Go, go, clear the
path, move aside, why are you standing there?" ||6-8||   The king, listening
intently to the auspicious words recited by the people who were bowing before
him, with a calm mind, proceeded forward. ||9||   He reached the place where the
venerable Gautama was seated, surrounded by many monks, his consciousness
purified by bathing in the waters of all scriptures, absorbed in pure
meditation, devoted to the exposition of the truth, seated on a peacock-shaped
seat, comfortable and endowed with powers, his radiance like that of the moon,
his brilliance like that of the sun, his hands and feet like the leaves of the
Ashoka tree. ||10-12||

32 Padmapurana He who pacifies the world with his peaceful body, the Lord of the
ascetics, Gautama, resides there. ||13|| He descended from afar, and walked on
foot. His eyes were filled with joy, and he was humble in his gait. ||14|| Then,
bowing to him with folded hands, the Tri-patya (three-fold) one, was given a
seat on the earth by the Lord of the Ganadharas. ||15|| Then, the king, with the
earth made white by the brilliance of his teeth, asked this question, first
inquiring about his well-being. ||16|| "O Bhagavan, I wish to hear the true
story of Padma. For, the fame of this has been generated by those who follow
evil ways. ||17|| "For, was the Lord of Lanka, Ravana, a Rakshasa, or a human
being? How was he, a creature of the lower realms, defeated by the small
monkeys? ||18|| "How could he, with his extremely foul-smelling human body, eat
human flesh? How was Vali, by deceit, killed by Ramadeva? ||19|| "And, going to
the abode of the gods, and destroying their excellent grove, how was Indra, the
king of the gods, brought to Ravana's prison? ||20|| "And, how could his younger
brother, Kumbhakarna, who was skilled in all the scriptures, and had a disease-
free body, sleep for six months? ||21|| "And, how was the bridge, which was so
high that it was difficult even for the gods to cross, built by the monkeys,
with such heavy mountains? ||22|| "O Bhagavan, be pleased to tell me all this.
By rescuing many beings from the mire of doubt, you will be doing a great
service. ||23|| Thus addressed, Ganesha, with his rays of teachings emanating,
as if washing away the dirt of the world with flowers, ||24|| dancing the
peacocks in the midst of the groves of creepers, with a deep, joyful roar, spoke
these words. ||25|| "Hear, O Ayushman, O King, beloved of the gods, with care.
My words are taught by the Jina, and are dedicated to revealing the true nature
of things. ||26|| "Ravana was not a Rakshasa, nor was he a man-eater. All that
they say is false, for they are the speakers of falsehood. ||27||

The third chapter cannot be written without a foundation. A speech without a
beginning is like a rootless tree. ||28|| Therefore, first listen to the
description of the field and time. Then listen to the stories of great men,
which destroy sins. ||29|| In the midst of the infinite space of the universe,
there are three realms, each surrounded by three rings of wind. This elevated
realm appears as if a large, heavy palm tree is standing in the middle of a
mortar. ||30|| The middle part of this realm, known as the Tiryanch Lok, is
surrounded by countless island-shaped continents and oceans. ||31|| This
Jambudvipa is like a potter's wheel. It is the best of all islands, situated in
the middle of the salt ocean, and extends for one hundred thousand yojanas in
all directions. ||32|| In the middle of this Jambudvipa is Mount Meru. This
mountain is indestructible, its base is made of diamonds, and its upper part is
made of gold, jewels, and gems. ||33|| Its high peak appears like a group of
clouds that are red due to the evening. There is only a space the size of the
tip of a hair between the earth of the Saudharma heaven and the peak of this
mountain. ||34|| It rises ninety-nine thousand yojanas above the earth and
extends one thousand yojanas below the earth. This mountain is made of diamonds
within the earth. ||35|| This mountain is ten thousand yojanas wide on the earth
and one thousand yojanas wide on its peak. It appears as if a rod has been
erected to measure the sky of the middle realm. ||36|| This Jambudvipa is
comprised of seven regions: Bharat, Himavat, Hari, Videha, Ramyak, Hairanyavat,
and Airavat. There are also two Kuru regions in the Videha region, known as
Devakuru and Uttarakuru. Six Kulachala mountains adorn this Jambudvipa, dividing
these seven regions. ||37|| Jambudvipa and Salmali are two great trees. There
are thirty-four Vijayadhara mountains in Jambudvipa, and each Vijayadhara
mountain has one hundred and ten cities of the Vidyadharas. ||38||

In the Padma Purana, thirty-four capitals are mentioned. There are fourteen
great rivers, and a Jain temple on the Jambū tree. ||39|| Six Bhoga-Kshetras are
mentioned, and eight Jinagṛhas. Eighty-six caves and the same number of
buildings are also mentioned. ||40|| There are four thrones and thirty chariots.
Two silver Vijayardha mountains are also mentioned. ||41|| In all the mountains
with Vaksara mountains, the temples of the Jinas are adorned with a wealth of
jewels. ||42|| In the Jambūmeru-Kshetra, in the southern direction, there is a
large Rakshasa island adorned with Jain images. ||43|| In the Mahavideha-
Kshetra, in the western direction, there is a large and auspicious Kinnara
island, shining with Jain images. ||44|| In the Airavata-Kshetra, in the
northern direction, there is an island called Gandharva, adorned with excellent
Chaityalayas. ||45|| In the Videha-Kshetra, east of Mount Meru, in the eastern
direction, the Dharana island shines. This Dharana island is also filled with
Jain temples. ||46|| The Bharat and Airavata Kshetras are both subject to
increase and decrease. The other Kshetras are stable, meaning that the cycle of
time does not change in them. ||47|| In the building on top of the Jambū tree,
there lives a god named Anavṛta. He is surrounded by many hundreds of gods of
the Kilviṣa caste. ||48|| In this Bharat Kshetra, when the first time period,
called Suṣamā, existed, it was filled with Kalpa trees, like the Uttarakuru.
This means that there was a perfect Bhoga-bhūmi here. ||49|| At that time, the
people here were radiant like the midday sun, two kosas tall, and perfectly
adorned with all auspicious marks. ||50|| Here, couples were born together, and
they lived for three

The third section of the text describes a land of unimaginable luxury and
abundance. The ground was paved with gold and precious gems, and it was said to
grant all desires. The land was covered in soft, fragrant grass, and the trees
bore fruit and flowers throughout the year. Animals like cows, buffaloes, and
sheep roamed freely, enjoying their lives.   Lions and other animals were gentle
and peaceful, feeding on the fruits of the Kalpavriksha trees, which granted any
wish. The lakes were filled with lotus flowers and adorned with gold and jewels,
overflowing with honey, milk, and ghee.   The mountains were majestic, adorned
with five colors and studded with precious stones, bringing joy to all
creatures. The rivers were free of crocodiles and other dangerous animals, their
waters tasting like milk, ghee, and honey. The climate was perfect, with no
extreme heat or cold, and no strong winds. The land was free from fear and
filled with constant celebrations.   The sun and moon were hidden behind the
radiant glow of the Kalpavriksha trees, which provided all sensory pleasures.
The land was filled with magnificent palaces, gardens, and comfortable beds, as
well as delicious food, drinks, clothes, perfumes, and music. All these things
were provided by the Kalpavriksha trees.   The couples in this land lived
happily, enjoying the beauty of the ten types of Kalpavriksha trees, just like
the couples in the heavens.   King Shrenik asked Ganadhara about the reason for
the existence of this land of pleasure. Ganadhara explained that those who are
simple-hearted and give food and other things to the monks are reborn in this
land of pleasure.

36 In the Papouraana, it is said that one who gives charity out of desire for
enjoyment, even though he may be considered virtuous, will still experience the
fruits of his actions, like an elephant or other animal.  ||66||  Just as a seed
sown in a soft, well-tilled field yields abundant crops, or as water poured on
sugarcane becomes sweet, and milk drunk by a cow turns into milk, so too,
charity given to a sage who is a repository of austerities, adorned with vows,
and free from all attachments, bears great fruit. ||67-69||  Just as a seed sown
in barren land yields little fruit, or as water poured on a neem tree becomes
bitter, and milk drunk by a snake turns into poison, so too, charity given to an
unworthy recipient yields bad fruit. ||70-71||  Gautama Swami says, "O King!
Just as a mirror reflects whatever is placed before it, so too, the fruits of
charity are proportionate to the giver's intentions." ||72||  Just as the white
and black fortnights follow each other in succession, so too, the Utsarpini and
Avasarpini cycles follow each other in succession. ||73||  When the third cycle
came to an end, and the groups of Kalpa trees began to perish in succession,
fourteen Kulakaras (founders of dynasties) arose. Listen, O Shrenik, to the
account of their reign. ||74||  The first Kulakara was named Pratiśruti. His
words brought joy to all the people. ||75||  He remembered his three previous
births, was devoted to good deeds, and guided all aspects of life. ||76||  After
countless millions of years, the second Kulakara, named Sanmati, arose. ||77||
He was followed by Kshemabhrit, Kshemandhara, Simabhrit, and Simadhara. ||78||
Then came Chakshusman. During his reign, the people saw the sun and moon in the
sky and were afraid. They asked, "O Lord! What are these two objects that we see
in the ocean of the sky?" ||79||  Hearing their question, Chakshusman remembered
his past lives.

The third age is nearing its end, and the radiance of the Kalpa trees is fading.
The two celestial deities, Chandra and Aditya, are now clearly visible. They are
known as Chandra and Aditya.   There are four types of deities: Jyotishi,
Bhavanavasi, Vyantara, and Kalpavasis. Beings are born into these realms based
on their karmic merit.   Chandra, the cool one, and Surya, the intense one, are
visible in the sky due to the nature of time. When Surya sets, Chandra's
brilliance increases. The constellations also become visible in the sky.
Knowing this is the nature of time, let go of fear. When Chakshusman, the ruler,
spoke these words, the people, relieved of their fear, returned to their usual
lives.   After Chakshusman ascended to heaven, Yashavi became the ruler. He was
followed by Vipul, Abhichandra, Chandraabha, Marudeva, Prasenajit, and finally,
Nabhi.   These fourteen rulers are considered like fathers to the people. They
were born from virtuous deeds and are all equal in wisdom.   After the
fourteenth ruler, Nabhi, all the Kalpa trees perished except for one. This
remaining Kalpa tree stood in the middle of Nabhi's realm, resembling a
magnificent palace.   The palace was adorned with pearl garlands, had walls made
of gold and jewels, and was embellished with a beautiful garden and a pond. It
was truly unique.   Nabhi's heart was captured by Marudevi, a beautiful queen.
Just as Rohini, the wife of Chandra, is known as Prachalattaraka (the moving
star), Marudevi also had sparkling eyes.   Just as Ganga, the wife of the ocean,
is born from the great mountain Himagiri, Marudevi was also...

Here is the translation of the given Sanskrit text into English, while retaining
the Sanskrit words:  ---  38   In the Padma Purana   Arundhati, the ever-
faithful companion of the Lord, is like a swan in her gait and like a cuckoo in
her sweet speech, akin to the well-nourished beloved of the husband. || 93 ||
The reference to the love of the husband (of the Chakravarti) conveys that by
approaching her, she attains a status beyond comparison, devoid of any
inferiority. || 94 || She, who is revered by all the worlds, is well-known as
Marudevi, just like the divine entity of Dharma is honored in all three worlds.
|| 95 || She seemingly was created from the moon's rays, having no trace of
hotness, like a mirror seeking beauty in its reflection. || 96 || Understanding
the sentiments of others, she appeared as if her essence is of the self; her
actions are free from bondage and her nature spreads across the three worlds
like that of a liberated soul. || 97 || Her disposition was one of virtuous
conduct, seemingly creating her identity from the Jain scriptures. She is like a
rain of wealth for those suffering from thirst, appearing as if she embodies the
essence of immortality. || 98 || She was capable of bringing satisfaction to her
friends, appearing as if she is comparable to liberation (nirvriti). Her form,
with gestures and playfulness, made her appear like the very essence of wine
(madira). || 99 || The decoration of her forehead was fulfilled solely by her
eyes; the garlands of blue lotuses were merely an additional adornment. || 100
|| The hair, resembling a bumblebee, was the ornament for her forehead, while
the buds of tamala flowers were merely burdens. || 101 || The tales of the
beloved of life were the true ornaments of her ears; the wearing of gems and
golden earrings was merely ostentation. || 102 || Her cheeks were the cause of
constant clarity of light.  ---  If you have any more text or need further

## Third Chapter  **104.**  Laughter itself was the fragrant powder, white in
hue, and the camphor particles were only for destroying the luster.  **105.**
Her voice itself was the sweet vina, the curiosity of the sound of the
instrument was only the striking of the strings by the ensemble.  **106.**  The
luster that appeared on her lips was the radiant glow of her body. The unguent
of saffron and the like was devoid of virtue and only a blemish on her beauty.
**107.**  Her delicate arms were sufficient to strike her husband in jest, the
pieces of straw were useless.  **108.**  The drops of sweat born from the heat
of youth were the ornaments of her breasts, the burden of the necklace was only
placed on them in vain.  **109.**  Her hips, wide like a stone slab, were the
cause of wonder, the platform of jewels made in the palace was made without
reason.  **110.**  The bees, mistaking her feet for lotuses, were her ornaments,
the anklets of Indra-blue gems were useless.  **111.**  To describe the glory of
the Marudevi, who enjoyed the pleasures born from the Kalpataru, along with her
navel-jewel, is impossible even with hundreds of thousands of books.  **112.**
When the time for the birth of Lord Rishabhadeva arrived, the Dikkumari Devis,
pleased by the command of Indra, began to serve Marudevi with great respect.
**113.**  Lakshmi, Shri, Dhriti, Kirti, and other Devis, uttering the words "May
you prosper," "Give your command," "May you live long," with great excitement,
awaited her command.  **114.**  At that time, some Devis praised her with heart-
stealing qualities, and some Devis, endowed with excellent knowledge, sang her
praises by playing the vina.  **115.**  Some sang a wonderful song, like nectar
to the ears, and some, with soft hands, stroked her feet.  **116.**  Some
offered betel nut, some offered a seat, and some, with swords in hand, were
always ready to protect her.  **117.**  Some stood at the inner door, and some
at the outer door, holding spears, golden staffs, clubs, and swords.

In the Padma Purana, Some were waving chamaras, some were holding the edge of a

sleeping on a very soft bed, covered with a fine cloth, with pillows on either
side. She was experiencing the pleasure of her own virtuous deeds. ||121-122||

like the moon, with a deep roar, whose trunk was dripping with the scent of
intoxicating nectar, and on which bees were buzzing. ||124|| In the second

a beautiful garland, who was roaring, and whose form was like a mass of autumn
clouds. ||125|| In the third dream, she saw a lion, adorned with a mane as white
as the rays of the moon, and with two fangs like the lines of the moon. ||126||

silver pitchers, and who was sitting motionless on a blooming lotus. ||127|| In
the fifth dream, she saw two very large garlands, made of Punnaga, Malati,
Kunda, and Champa flowers, and which attracted bees with their fragrance.

mountain, destroying the darkness, and giving fearless vision, free from the

friend of the lotuses, who caused them to bloom, who was like an ornament of the
night, who made all directions white with his rays, and who was the lord of the

## The Third Canto  **132.** A radiant pot, adorned with a garland of flowers,
its neck embellished with a necklace, filled with five-colored gems.  **133.** A
vast lake, covered with lotuses and blue lotuses, filled with pure water,
teeming with various birds, and adorned with beautiful steps.  **134.** An
ocean, with waves rising high from the movement of fish and large crocodiles,
adorned with clouds, and appearing like the sky itself.  **135.** A magnificent
throne, adorned with lions, shining with various gems, made of gold, and
towering high.  **136.** A celestial chariot, shaped like the peak of Mount
Meru, vast in size, adorned with gems, and embellished with bubbles, mirrors,
and fly whisks.  **137.** A palace, shaped like a Kalpavriksha tree, with many
floors, adorned with pearl garlands, and covered with a sheet of gems.  **138.**
A very high pile of five-colored precious stones, generating a rainbow from the
intermingling of their rays.  **139.** A fire, blazing with flames, devoid of
smoke, revolving clockwise, and without fuel.  **140.** After seeing these
dreams, the beautiful Marudevi awoke to the auspicious sounds of victory cries.
**141.** The attendants said, "O Goddess! This moon has become devoid of light,
due to the shame arising from the radiance of your face."  **142.** "This sun,
on the peak of the rising mountain, appears like a pot anointed with vermilion,
for auspiciousness."  **143.** "Your smile will now dispel the darkness, and the
lamps have become dim, as if realizing their own uselessness."  **144.** "This
group of birds, dwelling happily in their nests, is making a delightful noise,
as if celebrating your auspiciousness."  **145.** "These trees in the house,
united with the cool and gentle morning breeze, appear as if they are still..."

42 Padmapurana I This one, entering your house, is looking at the sun's orb. The
Chakravaki, with sweet sounds, calls out to her beloved. ||146|| These swans,
seeing your gait, are now filled with anticipation. They make their cooing
sounds, a reason to banish sleep. ||147|| The great sound, like that produced by
a carved bronze, is a beautiful display of the Sarasa birds' cries. ||148|| It
is clear that the night has ended, O pure-deeds one, Goddess, now give up sleep.
Thus, the one who was praised, the Marudevi, left her bed, which was like a wave
rising from a contraction of the sheet, and was filled with flowers, making it
like the sky filled with clouds and stars. ||149-150|| Leaving her dwelling,
she, who had completed all her tasks, went near the navel-king, like the Lakshmi
of the day goes to the sun. ||151|| There, sitting on a lower seat, she, with
folded hands, gradually narrated her dreams to her beloved, who was seated on a
magnificent throne. ||152|| Thus, the king, overwhelmed with joy at hearing the
queen's dreams, said, "O auspicious one, the Lord of the three worlds has taken
birth in your womb." ||153|| Hearing this, the lotus-eyed Marudevi was filled
with supreme joy, and she appeared like the beautiful form of the moon,
possessing a collection of radiance. ||154|| When six months were left for the
birth of the Jina, by the order of Indra, Kubera, with great respect, began to
shower down jewels. ||155|| Since the earth became golden while the Lord was in
the womb, Indra praised him with the name "Hiranyagarbha." ||156|| The Lord,
even in the womb, was endowed with the three knowledges: Mati, Shruta, and
Avadhi. And, with the thought that his movements should not cause any discomfort
to his mother, he did not move or stir in the womb. ||157|| Just as fire,
reflected in a mirror, does not cause any change, similarly, the Lord, while
residing in the womb, did not cause any change in the body of his mother,
Marudevi. ||158||

43 The Supreme Jina, free from the touch of impurities, emerged from the womb
like a crystal, when the time was ripe. ||159|| Then, a great festival was
celebrated by the name of the son's birth, with all the people rejoicing as
prescribed. ||160|| The three worlds were shaken, Indra's throne trembled, and
all the gods and demons exclaimed, "What is this?" ||161|| Then, without being
blown, the conch shell sounded in the abodes of the celestial beings. The drums
roared spontaneously in the houses of the Vyantaras. In the abode of the
celestial astrologers, the roar of lions was heard suddenly, and in the houses
of the Kalpa-dwelling gods, the sound of bells echoed. ||162-163|| With such
auspicious omens and the bowing of the crowns, the Indras, using their knowledge
of the future, came to know about the birth of the Tirthankara. ||164|| Then,
the Indras, filled with great enthusiasm and adorned with ornaments, mounted
their elephant king, Airavata, and set out for the house of Nabhiraj. ||165|| At
that time, some of the gods were dancing with love, some were clapping their
hands, some were raising their armies, some were roaring like lions, spreading
their sound throughout the world, some were making various costumes with skill,
and some were singing beautifully. ||166-167|| At that time, this world, filled
with great sounds, seemed to be falling apart due to the gods going up and down.
||168|| Then, Kubera created the city of Ayodhya. That city of Ayodhya was
surrounded by a huge fort, the size of Mount Vijaya. ||169|| A deep moat,
reaching down to the netherworld, encircled it on all sides, and the tops of the
tall towers extended far into the sky. ||170|| The Indras, filled with great
blessings, reached the house of Nabhiraj in an instant, which was covered with a
garment of light from various jewels. ||171|| Indra, along with the gods,
circumambulated the city three times and then entered the delivery room,
bringing the Jina from the abode of the Pauloma. ||172||

44 In the Padma Purana, I bow down to the mother of the Jina, who, having made
the illusory child, took the real child in her arms. The mother, having given
the child to Indra's wife, Shachi, in her hands, bowed down.  ||173|| Seeing the
form of the Jina, even Indra, with his thousand eyes, did not attain
satisfaction, for the Jina's form was beyond the limits of the three worlds.
||174|| Then, placing the Jina on his lap, Indra mounted the elephant king,
Airavata. The other gods, with great devotion, held the fly whisk, umbrella,
etc. ||175|| Thus, accompanied by all the gods, Indra reached the peak of Mount
Meru, which was resplendent with the brilliance of the collection of gems like
vaidurya, etc. ||176|| There, on a rock called Pandukambala, where a natural
throne was situated, Indra placed the Jina and stood behind him. ||177|| Then,
the gods sounded the conch shells, which made a sound like the agitated ocean,
and they also made the loud sound of the mridanga and conch. ||178|| The
Yakshas, Kinnaras, Gandharvas, Tumburu, Narada, and Visvavasu, along with their
wives, sang beautiful songs that captivated the mind and ears, while performing
excellent fainting spells. Lakshmi also played the vina with great respect.
||179-180|| The Apsaras, adorned with ornaments and filled with gestures,
performed excellent dances, performing the Angahara as it should be. ||181||
Thus, when there was singing, playing, and dancing by the best of the gods,
Indra took a auspicious pot in his hand for the abhisheka. ||182|| Then, Indra
performed the abhisheka of the Jina with a thousand and eight pots, which were
filled with the water of the ocean of milk, which were very heavy to carry,
which were made of gold, whose mouths were covered with lotuses, and whose
beauty was enhanced by red leaves. Indra, by the power of his karma, created
many forms of himself. ||183-184|| Yama, Vaishravana, Soma, Varuna, and other
gods, as well as all the remaining Indras, performed the abhisheka of the Jina
with devotion. ||185|| Indra's wife and other goddesses, with their hands as
soft as leaves, anointed the Jina with fragrant unguents. ||186||

## The Third Chapter  **187.** Just as a mountain is consecrated by clouds, so
too was the Lord consecrated by large pitchers, and the gods were eager to adorn
him.  **188.** At that moment, Indra adorned his ears with earrings like the
moon and the sun, fashioned from a vajra needle.  **189.** A pure padmaraga gem
was placed on his crown, making his head appear adorned with matted hair due to
its rays.  **190.** A crescent-shaped mark was made on his forehead with
sandalwood, and his arms were adorned with golden armlets.  **191.** His chest,
adorned with the Srivatsa mark, was decorated with a necklace made of large
pearls like stars, radiating with brilliance.  **192.** He was adorned with a
large garland of green gems and padmaraga gems, whose large rays seemed to
sprout like leaves.  **193.** His two full wrists, adorned with auspicious
ornaments, were adorned with beautiful bracelets studded with gems, adding to
their splendor.  **194.** His hips, adorned with a silken waist-band, appeared
like the shore of a mountain adorned with the red line of twilight.  **195.**
His fingers were adorned with excellent rings, made of gold and studded with
various gems.  **196.** All this adornment was done by the gods out of devotion.
For him, who was the ornament of the three worlds, what other adornment could be
superior?  **197.** His body was smeared with sandalwood, and yellow spots of
saffron were applied, making him appear as if golden lotuses were placed on a
crystal surface.  **198.** A shawl, embroidered with flowers, was placed on his
body, shining like a clear sky adorned with stars.  **199.** A large crown, made
of the flowers of the Parijata and Santanaka trees, was placed on his head,
attracting swarms of bees.  **200.** The middle of his eyebrows was adorned with
fragrant sandalwood paste. He, who was the tilak of the three worlds, was
adorned with beautiful gestures.

46 In the Padma Purana, the Lord, adorned with ornaments, the embellishment of
the three worlds, was thus praised by the gods, led by Indra. ||201|| In this
world devoid of Dharma, enveloped in the darkness of ignorance, you have risen
like the sun for the noble beings who wander about. ||202|| With the pure rays
of your words, like the moon of the Jinas, the noble beings, like the lotus,
will now attain enlightenment. ||203|| O Lord, you are the great lamp that burns
in this house of the world, born from the fire of perfect knowledge, for the
purpose of the noble beings seeing the true nature of the soul and non-soul.
||204|| You are the sharp arrow born to destroy the enemy of sin. You are the
one who will burn the forest of existence with the fire of meditation. ||205|| O
Lord, you have risen like Garuda to subdue the great serpents of evil passions,
and you are like the mighty wind that disperses the clouds of doubt. ||206|| The
noble beings, like the chatakas, thirsty for the drops of the water of Dharma,
look up to you, the Lord, the great treasure of nectar. ||207|| Salutations to
you, whose pure fame is sung by the three worlds. Salutations to you, the tree
adorned with the flowers of virtues, the giver of desired fruits. ||208||
Salutations to you, the sharp axe that cleaves the wood of karma. Salutations to
you, who are always the thunderbolt that shatters the mountain of delusion.
||209|| Salutations to you, the water that quenches the fire of suffering, the
sky that is free from the dust of attachment. ||210|| Thus, praising the Lord
with proper rites and bowing down again and again, the gods, with joyful faces,
placed him on the elephant and set out for Ayodhya. ||211|| Then, Indra, having
placed the Jina child in the lap of his mother, the queen, performed the great
celebration of joy and then went to his own abode with the other gods. ||212||
Then, the Lord was adorned with divine ornaments and anointed with fragrant
perfumes that filled the air with delight. ||213||

Here is the translation of the provided text while retaining the Sanskrit words:
---  7   In the third section, seeing her son sitting in her lap, the mother,
Marudevi, was very pleased at that time. With her own shadow embraced and
decorated by brilliance, she had covered the directions. (21) Embracing him, her
heart overflowing with gentle touch and curiosity, she descended into the ocean
of happiness. (215) Due to having obtained her son, she glowed like the newly
risen sun illuminating the eastern direction. (216) Seeing her son adorned with
divine ornaments and endowed with excellent beauty, she thought of him as her
own supreme radiance connected with the wealth of the three worlds. (217) The
mind of Rajanabhi, who had experienced the manifestation of happiness associated
with the body of his son, melted, as the third part of his eyes closed in bliss.
(218) The Jinendra, having attained prominence due to the worship performed by
Indra, was given the name 'Rishabha' by his parents. (219) The mutual love
between the parents, which had grown towards the child, Rishabha Deva, was
concentrated at that time. (220) While drinking the nectar placed on the thumb
of the Lord by Indra, he gradually attained physical growth. (221) Thereafter,
together with the divine boys, similarly approved by Indra, the Lord began to
play a flawless game that brought happiness to his parents. (222) Everything he
owned, whether it be a seat, bed, vehicle, food, clothing, or the retinue of
others, was received from Indra. (223) In a short time, he attained supreme
growth. His chest became as broad and elevated as the Meru mountain. (224) His
arms, resembling the wish-fulfilling trees for the entire world, took the form
of pillars to confine the giants of hope. (225) His two shoulders held the
application of beauty bestowed by himself, appearing as if two pillars had been
erected to support the house of the three worlds. (226)  ---   Please note that
the translation is a compact rendition of the original Sanskrit, aimed at
retaining the essence and structure of the text while presenting it in English.

In the Padma Purana, He bore two things in his mouth, which were mutually
opposed. He had conquered the moon by his radiance and the sun by his
brilliance. ||227|| His hands, though soft as tender leaves, were of a reddish
hue. They were capable of pulverizing all the mountains and defeating all the
kings. ||228|| His hair was thick and glossy, and it looked as if a blue
sapphire was placed on the peak of Mount Meru. ||229|| Though he was a righteous
soul, he had stolen the eyes of all beings with his incomparable beauty. ||230||
At that time, all the Kalpa trees had perished, and the whole earth was adorned
with spontaneously grown grains, without being sown or cultivated. ||231|| The
people of that time were devoid of trade, commerce, and crafts. They had no
concept of religion and were free from hypocrisy. ||232|| The food of the people
was sugarcane juice, which was full of six flavors. It was self-cut and fell
from the stalk, and it was capable of providing strength, vigor, and other
qualities. ||233|| But due to the influence of time, it stopped flowing on its
own. People did not know how to extract juice from sugarcane using machines.
||234|| Even though they saw the grains, they were ignorant of the method of
processing them. They were tormented by hunger and were in great distress.
||235|| Then, they came together in great pain and sought refuge in the Lord of
the Navel. They bowed down and praised him, saying: ||236|| "O Lord! The Kalpa
trees, which sustained us, have all perished. We are tormented by hunger and
have come to you for refuge. Please protect us." ||237|| "We see something
growing on the earth, which is full of fruits. It may be fit for eating after
being processed, but we do not know the method." ||238|| "This substance is
coming out from the breasts of cows that roam freely. Is it edible or inedible?
How should we consume it? Please tell us, O Lord." ||239||

The Third Chapter 49 Lions, tigers, and other animals were once suitable for
embracing during play, but now they are intent on strife and terrify the people.
||24|| We see many beautiful and divine things in the sky, on land, and in
water, but we do not know how we can be happy with them. ||241|| Therefore, O
God, tell us the means to reform them, so that we may live happily, protected by
your grace. ||242|| Thus addressed, Sannabhi, the king, whose heart was filled
with compassion, spoke words that revealed the cause of the situation. ||243||
At the time of his birth, there was a shower of jewels for a long time, and the
arrival of the gods caused turmoil in the world. ||244|| Let us go to the great
and extraordinary Rishabhadeva and ask him the cause of life-giving sustenance.
||245|| There is no human being in this world like him. His soul is beyond all
darkness of ignorance. ||246|| Thus spoken to, Sannabhi, along with his people,
went to the presence of Rishabhadeva. Seeing his father, the god performed the
appropriate rites. ||247|| Then, Sannabhi and Rishabhadeva sat on their
respective seats. Then, the people, with prostrations, began to praise the god.
||248|| O Lord, your body, filled with all auspicious marks, is shining
brightly, overwhelming the entire world with its brilliance. ||249|| Your
extremely pure qualities, like the rays of the moon, bring joy and pervade the
entire world. ||250|| We came to your father, carrying our tasks, but these are
the qualities born of your knowledge that he speaks of. ||251|| You are a great
being, a great soul, endowed with extraordinary qualities. Even a wise king like
Sannabhi comes to you to seek certainty. ||252|| Therefore, you, being such,
protect us who are afflicted by hunger, and tell us the means to overcome the
fear of lions and other evil animals. ||253|| 1. Sannabhi, K., M. | 2. -sten

50 Padmapurana Then, Nabhinandan, whose heart was filled with compassion, ruled
over his subjects, who, with folded hands, had fallen at his feet. ||254|| He
taught his people hundreds of crafts, the planning of cities, the establishment
of villages and settlements, and the construction of houses and other buildings.
||255|| Those men whom he appointed to protect the land were known in the world
as Kshatriyas, because of their virtues. ||256|| Those who were engaged in
trade, agriculture, cattle-raising, and other occupations were known in the
world as Vaishyas. ||257|| Those who were engaged in low-caste work and who were
far from the scriptures were called Shudras. They had many divisions, such as
servants, slaves, etc. ||258|| This era, which brought happiness to all, was
established by Lord Rishabhadeva. It was an era of prosperity, and so the people
called it the Krita Yuga. ||259|| Lord Rishabhadeva had two wives, Sunanda and
Nanda. From them were born his mighty sons, Bharat and others. ||260|| His
hundred sons were all beautiful in their virtues and relationships. They adorned
the earth, which was constantly filled with festivals. ||261|| As the Lord of
the world, Nabhinandan, enjoyed his unparalleled wealth, a great deal of time
passed. ||262|| Then, one day, while the celestial maiden, Neelanjana, was
dancing, a thought arose in his mind, which was the cause of his detachment.
||263|| He thought, "Alas! These people of the world are striving to please
others, and they are getting nothing but ridicule in return. Their actions are
like the antics of madmen, and they are only causing themselves pain." ||264||
"What a strange world this is! Some are forced to become servants, while others,
with arrogant words, give orders to them." ||265|| "Curse this world, where
deluded beings create only suffering, and mistake it for happiness!" ||266||
"Therefore, I will abandon this perishable and artificial happiness, and strive
to attain the happiness of the Siddhas." ||267|| As these thoughts were passing
through his mind, the celestial beings came to him and spoke. ||268||

The third chapter, the virtuous Lord, is enlightened, the cause of the welfare
of the three worlds. The path to liberation, which had been interrupted, is now
open. ||269|| These beings are revolving in the great ocean of worldly
suffering. They are not being reformed without a teacher. ||270|| Let the beings
now walk the path shown by you. They will attain the position of the liberated
beings, which is filled with eternal happiness and is at the forefront of the
world. ||271|| Thus, the words spoken by the gods were repeated before the self-
enlightened Lord, the great soul, Adi Nath. ||272|| As soon as the Lord decided
to leave his home, the gods, led by Indra, arrived as before. ||273|| Arriving,
all the gods praised the Lord with salutations and repeatedly said, "O Lord, you
have made a very good decision." ||274||  Then, the Lord, mounted on a
palanquin, which was adorned with a canopy of jewels that filled the directions,
with beautiful fly whisks on either side, like the rays of the moon, shining
with the reflection of a full moon, adorned with jeweled bells, half-moon
shaped, decorated with banners of cloth, fragrant with divine garlands, adorned
with pearl necklaces, beautiful to behold, resembling a celestial chariot, with
small bells ringing, and on which Indra had placed his shoulder, made by divine
sculptors, left his home. ||275-278|| Then, the space between the three worlds
was filled with the sound of the instruments and the dancing gods. ||279||
Accompanied by the gods, filled with great splendor and devotion, the Lord
reached the garden called Tilaka. ||280|| The Lord Vrishabhadeva went to that
garden called Tilaka, away from the people, so that place became known as
"Prajag." Or, the Lord performed a great sacrifice, or renunciation, at that
place, so it became known as "Prayag." ||281|| Arriving there, the Lord asked
permission from his parents and relatives to take initiation, and then said,
"Namaha Siddhebhyah" - salutations to the Siddhas. ||282||  Here, the Lord's
mind was engaged in good thoughts, when at that very moment, the celestial gods
arrived and began to make the following request. ||268|| They said, "O Lord, the
thought you have had to benefit the beings of the three worlds is very good. The
path to liberation has been closed for a long time." ||269|| These beings are
diving into the ocean of worldly suffering without a teacher. ||270|| At this
time, the beings will walk the path shown by you and attain the position of the
liberated beings, which is filled with eternal happiness and is at the forefront
of the world. ||271||

Certainly! Here is the translation of the provided text into English while
keeping the Sanskrit words intact:  ---  In the Padma Purana, The great sage,
having given up his adornments and garments, uprooted his hair with five
fingers.  (283)   Then, King Indra placed those hair into a treasure chest and
afterward cast them on his head in the ocean of milk. (284)   Having established
his glory for the purpose of Jain initiation, the divine beings and thoughtful
humans departed as they had arrived. (285)   Thousands of kings, who could not
comprehend the Lord's intent, attained the state of nakedness driven solely by
their devotion to their masters. (286)   Then, after half a year, the Lord
Vṛṣabhadeva remained steadfast in the practice of fasting like the Sumeru
mountain. (287)   His disheveled hair, blown by the wind, appeared like the
smokey formations of karmic bondage burning in the fire of meditation. (288)
Then, before six months had passed, the group of kings who had taken initiation
together was defeated by the great warriors known as Parīṣhads. (289)   Some of
those kings fell to the ground, struck by the wind of suffering, while some, due
to their strong vitality, sat on the earth. (290)   Some, tormented by hunger,
abandoned their fasting to eat fruits. Others, tortured by their bodies, entered
cool water. (291)   Some, breaking the bonds of righteousness, began to enter
the caves of the mountains like maddened elephants, while others, regaining
their senses, prepared to see Lord Jinendra. (292)   Among all those kings, the
son of Bharata, Mārīchi, was quite arrogant, and so he donned saffron robes and
became an ascetic, along with many others wearing the bark garments. (293)
When those kings, in the form of naked individuals, were about to collect fruits
and other things, the invisible gods pronounced the following words in the sky:
"O kings! Do not perform this action while being naked, for it will indeed
become a source of great suffering for you." (294-295)   Hearing the words of
the deities, many individuals donned leaves of trees.    ---  This translation
maintains the original structure and includes explanations where necessary for
clarity.

Many people took to wearing tree bark, some covered themselves in leather, and
some even put back on the clothes they had previously discarded. ||296||
Feeling ashamed of their nakedness, many people took to wearing kusha grass
garments. Having thus donned leaves and such, they were all satiated by fruits
and cool water. ||297||  Thereafter, all the kings who had fallen into bad ways
gathered together and, without fear, began to consult with each other, having
gone far away. ||298||  One of them addressed the other kings, saying, "Did the
Lord say anything to any of you?" ||299||  The other kings replied, "He did not
say anything to any of us." Hearing this, a king who desired pleasures said,
"Then what is the point of staying here? Let us rise and go to our respective
countries, and enjoy the happiness that comes from seeing the faces of our sons
and wives." ||300-301||  Another one of them said, "Since we are in sorrow, we
are ready to go. There is no task that we cannot do because of our sorrow. But
we must remember that when Bharat sees us returning alone, without our master,
he will be angry and will surely take our countries away from us." ||302-303||
"Or, when the Lord Rishabhadeva regains his kingdom and returns to rule after
leaving the forest, how will we, without shame, look him in the face?" ||304||
"Therefore, let us stay here, eating fruits and such, and serving him, wandering
about in happiness." ||305||  Now, the Lord Rishabhadeva was seated in a posture
of meditation, when Nami and Vinami, eager to beg for boons, bowed down at his
feet and stood there. ||306||  At that time, the king of the Naga serpents,
Dharanendra, realized that Nami and Vinami were begging the Lord for boons,
because he felt the seat tremble. Knowing this, he quickly arrived there.
||307||  Dharanendra, assuming the form of the Lord, gave Nami and Vinami two
excellent vidyas. Having received those vidyas, they both immediately went to
the Vijayardha mountain. ||308||  Ascending ten yojanas, they found there vidya-
filled abodes, filled with various kinds of boons, equal to those of the
Mogakshita, scattered throughout different countries and cities. ||309||

In the Padma Purana, ten yojanas above the Vijayadhar mountain, there are the
abodes of the Vidyadharas. These abodes are filled with various countries and
cities, and they appear like a land of enjoyment.    Ten yojanas above the
Vidyadharas' abodes, there are thousands of cities of the Gandharvas and
Kinnaras.   Five yojanas above that, the mountain is covered with the temples of
the Arhats, and it appears like the mountain of Nandishvara.   In those temples
of the Arhats, there are always present the Muni Rajas, who are devoted to
study, possess the wealth of the Charanas, and are supremely radiant.   On the
southern slope of the Vijayadhar mountain, there are fifty cities, starting with
Rathanupura and ending with Sandhyabhra. On the northern slope, there are sixty
cities, starting with Gaganavallabha.   Each of these cities is superior to the
next, filled with various countries and villages, crowded with monasteries,
adorned with wide open spaces and courtyards, decorated with large gateways and
balconies, embellished with golden walls and arches, filled with ponds and
gardens, offering the enjoyment of heaven, filled with trees bearing all kinds
of fruits that grow without being sown, filled with all kinds of medicinal
herbs, and fulfilling the desires of all.   Their earth always shines like a
land of enjoyment. The springs there always flow with honey, milk, ghee, and
other juices. The lakes there are filled with lotuses and adorned with swans and
other birds. The steps of the ponds there are made of jewels and gold, and they
are filled with water as clear and sweet as honey. They are covered with the
pollen of lotuses. In the sheds there, there are herds and herds of Kamadhenu
cows, whose radiance is like that of the full moon, whose hooves and horns are
yellow like gold, and who are pleasing to the eyes.   There are cows there whose
dung and urine are fragrant and have the power to increase radiance and vitality
like a tonic. What can be compared to their milk?   In those cities, there are
groups of queens with their sons, all of whom are dark like blue lotuses and
radiant like lotuses.

## The Third Chapter  **32.** Rows of buffaloes with their calves, adorned with
a reddish hue, roam freely. Mountains of grain, inexhaustible stores in
granaries, palaces radiating brilliance, surrounded by pools and gardens.
**325.** Roads free of dust and thorns, offering comfort, shaded by great trees,
and watering places filled with all kinds of flavors.  **326.** For four months,
clouds with melodious voices, pleasing to the ears, shower nectar-like rain upon
the land at the right time.  **327.** The winter season, devoid of icy winds,
brings joy to those who enjoy its pleasantness. People are well-dressed,
fulfilling their desires.  **328.** Even in the summer, the sun, as if hesitant,
radiates a gentle warmth. It illuminates the lotus blooms, adorned with the
brilliance of various gems.  **329.** All other seasons are also conducive to
obtaining desired objects. The clear directions are free from mist and other
impurities, shining brightly.  **330.** There is not a single place that lacks
happiness. People constantly revel in their enjoyment, as if in a land of
pleasure.  **331.** The women are delicate, adorned with all kinds of ornaments,
skilled in understanding gestures, and possessors of fame, fortune, modesty,
patience, and radiance.  **332.** Some have the radiance of a lotus bud, some
the dark glow of a blue lotus, some the soft green of a shirisha flower, and
some the yellow brilliance of lightning.  **333.** They are fragrant, as if
created by the wind of Nandana, and adorned with beautiful flowers, as if born
from the spring season.  **334.** Others, with bodies like moonstone, constantly
fill the lakes with their radiant moonlight.  **335.** Their eyes are adorned
with three colors - red, black, and white. They walk gracefully like swans,
their breasts are full, their waists slender, and their movements resemble those
of celestial beings.

In the Padma Purana, the men have faces like the moon, are valiant, have chests
like lions, and long arms. They are capable of flying in the sky and possess
excellent qualities, virtues, and actions. ||336|| They are always content with
righteous conduct, have radiance like the gods, are beautiful like desire, and
roam freely with women as they please. ||337|| Thus, these earth-dwelling gods,
the Vidyadharas, with their minds attached to Vidya (knowledge) personified as
women, enjoy their desired pleasures in the two beautiful ranges of the
Vijayadha mountain, free from obstacles, as a result of their Dharma. ||338|| In
this way, all beings attain their pleasures and possessions through Dharma.
Therefore, O noble beings! Just as the sun destroys darkness in the sky, so too
should you strive to attain one Dharma, destroying the darkness of ignorance
within yourselves. ||339||  Thus ends the third chapter of the Padma Charita,
known as the Vidyadhara Loka, narrated by the Acharya Ravishena. ||3||

## The Fourth Chapter  Thus, the Lord, the Dhyani, Shatakumbha Prabhu, the
Master, was ready to perform the act of charity for the benefit of the world.
||1||  Free from all defects, he had embraced the vow of silence and, after
completing the image-yoga for six months, the valiant Lord began to wander the
earth. ||2||  The people saw the Lord wandering, his form towering, his body
radiating light, as if a second sun were moving. ||3||  Wherever the Lord placed
his feet, it seemed as if lotuses were blooming on the earth. ||4||  His
shoulders were as high as Mount Meru, radiant, adorned with long, flowing locks
of hair, and the Lord, with great care, looked down as he walked. ||5||  One
day, while wandering, the Lord, who seemed like Mount Meru himself in his
splendor, entered Hastinapur at midday. ||6||  Seeing the Lord, who shone like
the midday sun, all the men and women of Hastinapur were struck with wonder and
lost consciousness. ||7||  People brought him various colored clothes, different
kinds of jewels, elephants, horses, chariots, and other vehicles. ||8||  Some
men brought beautiful maidens, with faces like the full moon, eyes like lotuses,
and adorned with graceful attire. ||9||  But these virtuous maidens were not
pleasing to the Lord, and they, feeling rejected, cast away their ornaments and
stood there, meditating on the Lord. ||10||  Then, the king, Shreyans, standing
on the top of his palace, looked at the Lord with affection and remembered his
past life. ||11||

In the Padma Purana, Nrisimha, surrounded by his inner palace friends, stood
with folded hands, a lotus of praise and hymns. ||12|| The king,
circumambulating him, shone like the sun revolving around the Meru mountain.
||13|| Then, with his hair, he cleansed the Lord's feet, washing them with tears
of joy. ||14|| Offering a golden vessel, he performed the foot-washing ceremony,
placing him in a pure place, according to the highest ritual. ||15|| Taking a
cool drink of sugarcane juice from a pitcher, he performed the supreme Parana,
his mind drawn to the Lord's virtues. ||16|| Then, the delighted gods, with a
chorus of "Sadhu" and "Dhannya," filled the sky with the sound of drums. ||17||
The lords of the Pramathas, showering down five-colored flowers, exclaimed with
joy, "Oh, what a gift! Oh, what a gift!" ||18|| The wind, fragrant and sweet,
blew through the directions, while a stream of jewels poured down, filling the
sky. ||19|| Thus, King Shreyans received divine honors that astonished the three
worlds, while Emperor Bharat, filled with great joy, worshipped him. ||20||
Then, initiating the practice of the Panipatra Vrata, he, the conqueror of the
senses, immersed himself in auspicious meditation. ||21|| From that pure
meditation, his delusion vanished, and he attained Kevala Jnana, the knowledge
that illuminates both the world and the beyond. ||22|| With this, a great halo
of light arose, dispelling the distinction between night and day, its radiance
illuminating all. ||23|| In that place, a magnificent Ashoka tree appeared, its
trunk thick, adorned with jeweled flowers, and its leaves a vibrant red. ||24||

The sky was filled with fragrant flowers, attracting swarms of bees, falling in
various forms.  Salutations to the one who traverses the realms of existence,
adorned with the forms of the steadfast immortals. ||25||  Great drums
resounded, their sound like the roar of a churning ocean, struck by the palm
leaves of invisible gods. ||26||  Two Yakshas, their eyes like lotus buds,
adorned with all ornaments, waved their white, moon-bright fly whisks at will.
||27||  A throne arose, resembling the peak of Mount Meru, a crown for the
earth-goddess, eclipsing the sun with its radiance. ||28||  A triple umbrella
emerged, a symbol of dominion over the three realms, adorned with strings of
pearls, its brilliance like the pure glory of the Lord. ||29||  Only the Kevali,
the Perfect One, can describe the beauty of the Lord seated on the throne amidst
the assembly.  We, mere mortals, are incapable of such a task. ||30||   * Then,
knowing of the Lord's attainment of Kevala Jnana, all the Indras, accompanied by
their families, arrived swiftly to pay their respects. ||31||  First among them
was the renowned Ganadhara, the Muni Raja, Vrishabhasena.  After him, other Muni
Rajas, adorned with great dispassion, became Ganadharas. ||32||  When the Munis,
Shravakas, and Devas were all seated in their respective places in the assembly,
the Ganadhara urged the Lord to preach. ||33||  The Lord, silencing the sound of
the divine drums with his own voice, spoke the following words, revealing the
essence of truth. ||34||  He said, "In this entire three-world universe, for
those seeking the welfare of all beings, Dharma is the ultimate refuge, and from
it comes the highest happiness." ||35||  "All actions are undertaken for
happiness, and happiness arises from Dharma.  Knowing this, O noble ones, strive
to accumulate Dharma." ||36||  "Without clouds, how can there be rain?  Without
seeds, how can there be crops?  Similarly, without Dharma, how can there be
happiness for beings?" ||37||  "Just as a lame man desires to walk, a mute man
desires to speak, and a blind man desires to see, so too, without Dharma, there
is no happiness." ||38||

In the Padma Purana, it is said that there is nothing smaller than an atom and
nothing bigger than the sky. Similarly, there is no friend greater than Dharma
for embodied beings. (39)  When Dharma alone brings about worldly enjoyments,
heaven, and the bliss of the liberated, what is the use of engaging in other
activities? (40)  Those wise ones who serve Dharma, purified by non-violence,
attain liberation. Others, however, go to the animal realm or lower realms. (41)
Even if those who have renounced the world, like swans, great swans, and
wandering ascetics, attain higher realms through the power of their austerities,
they still serve other gods as servants. (42)  Even after attaining the status
of gods, they suffer the misery of hell due to their karmas and fall from
heaven, returning to the animal realm in sorrow. (43)  Those who are endowed
with right faith and have diligently studied the teachings of the Jinas, attain
heaven and, upon falling from there, attain the supreme liberation by obtaining
the three jewels. (44)  This Dharma is of two types: for householders and for
monks. Those who believe in a third type of Dharma are burnt by the fire of
delusion. (45)  Five Anuvratas, three Gunavratas, and four Shikshavrata
constitute the Dharma for householders. (46)  Those householders who, at the
time of death, renounce all beginnings, become detached from their bodies, and
die with equanimity, attain a glorious destiny. (47)  Five Mahavratas, five
Samitis, and three Guptis constitute the Dharma for monks. (48)  Those who are
united with Dharma and are devoted to auspicious meditation, abandon this foul-
smelling, repulsive body and attain heaven or liberation. (49)  Those who praise
the great Brahmachari Digambara monks with devotion also attain Dharma. (50)  By
the influence of that Dharma, they do not fall into evil destinies, but attain
the three jewels, which liberate them from the bondage of karma. (51)  Thus,
having heard this supreme Dharma spoken by the Lord of Gods, Lord Rishabhadeva,
both gods and humans were filled with supreme joy. (52)  Just as a blind person
desires to see, so too, it is to seek happiness without Dharma. (38)

## Fourth Chapter  Some attained Right Faith and embraced the householder's
dharma, while others, following their own strength, adopted the life of an
ascetic. ||53||  Then, ready to depart, the gods and demons bowed to the Jina,
praised him, and adorned with dharma, went to their respective abodes. ||54||
Wherever the Omniscient went, by virtue of his power of movement, a hundred
yojanas around became like heaven. ||55||  Wandering through many lands, the
Jina, with the gift of the Three Jewels, liberated countless beings from the
ocean of samsara. ||56||  He had eighty-four Ganadharas and eighty-four thousand
virtuous, tapasvi Sadhus. ||57||  These Sadhus were of the purest mind, radiant
like the sun and moon. Surrounded by them, the Jina wandered the earth. ||58||
The king, Bharat, son of Rishabhadeva, attained the fortune of a Chakravarti,
and this land became known as Bharat Kshetra in the world. ||59||  Rishabhadeva
had a hundred sons, each more radiant and brilliant than the last, who,
embracing the ascetic vow, attained the supreme state. ||60||  Among them,
Bharat Chakravarti was the firstborn, residing in the beautiful city of Ayodhya,
served by a multitude of virtuous people. ||61||  He possessed nine
inexhaustible treasures filled with precious gems, ninety thousand mines, three
crore cows, one crore ploughs, eighty-four lakh noble elephants, eighteen crore
horses swift as the wind, thirty-two thousand mighty kings, thirty-two thousand
lands adorned with cities, fourteen jewels eternally protected by the gods, and
ninety-six thousand women. It is impossible to describe his complete wealth.
||62-66||  In the city of Podanpur, Bharat's half-brother, King Bahubali,
resided. He was immensely powerful and, driven by the ego, "Bharat and I are two
sons of the same father," always opposed Bharat. ||67||

## Chapter 62 of the Padma Purana  62 Padma Purana 1  The first battle, filled
with the din of elephants, chariots, and weapons, arose, causing great
destruction. || 69 ||  Then, laughing, the mighty Bahubali said to Bharata,
"What purpose is served by killing these innocent creatures? What do we gain
from this?" || 70 ||  "If you have defeated me with your unwavering gaze, then I
consider myself defeated. Let us engage in a battle of vision." || 71 ||
Bharata was defeated in the battle of vision, and then in the water battle and
the battle of arms. Finally, Bharata hurled the Chakra Ratna to kill his
brother. || 72 ||  But Bahubali was in his final body, and the Chakra Ratna was
unable to kill him. It returned to Bharata, its mission unsuccessful. || 73 ||
Understanding the root of their conflict, the magnanimous Bahubali renounced all
worldly desires. || 74 ||  He abandoned all possessions, stripped himself of his
ornaments, and stood motionless like Mount Meru for a year, practicing the image
yoga. || 75 ||  He was surrounded by many snakes that emerged from the burrows
of the creepers, and by the vines of the Shyama plant. In this state, he
attained Kevala Jnana. || 76 ||  When his lifespan ended, he attained the state
of Shiva. He was the first to purify the path to liberation in this descending
age. || 77 ||  Bharata ruled his kingdom, free from thorns, dividing the entire
land of Bharata into six parts. || 78 ||  All the villages in his kingdom were
like the cities of the Vidyadharas, filled with all kinds of pleasures. All the
cities were like the heavenly realms, filled with the finest treasures. || 79 ||
The people in his kingdom were like the gods, always adorned, and they received
whatever they desired in their minds. || 80 ||  The lands were like pleasure
gardens, the kings were like the guardians of the world, and the women were like
Apsaras, the abode of love. || 81 ||  Thus, the king of the earth, like
Aakhandala in heaven, enjoyed the fruits of his good karma. || 82 ||

The fourth, Subhadra, a jewel of all sensual pleasures, shone brightly,
protected by a thousand Yakshas with great effort. ||83||  Five hundred sons of
his, by whom this land called Bharata was enjoyed by division, given by his
father, free from thorns. ||84||  Then, thus spoken by the great Gautama, the
Shrenika, curious, again spoke these words. ||85||  "O Bhagavan, you have told
me the origin of the three varnas (Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra). Now I wish to
know the origin of the Sutrakantas (Brahmanas). ||86||  They, desiring good
karma, perform acts like killing of animals, etc., and carry a great pride, for
the sake of attaining Dharma. ||87||  Therefore, you are worthy to speak of the
origin of those of opposite tendencies. And also tell me how the people of these
household Brahmanas become devotees." ||88||  Thus questioned, Ganesha, whose
heart was embraced by the grace of women, and who had destroyed envy, spoke
these words. ||89||  "O Shrenika, listen to this, how the origin of those of
opposite tendencies, whose minds are bound by delusion, came about. ||90||  In
the region near the city of Saketa, the first Jina, surrounded by gods, humans,
and animals, once resided. ||91||  Knowing him, Bharata was pleased, and having
prepared excellent food for the sake of the ascetics, he went to the Jina.
||92||  Prostrating to the Jina with devotion, and to all the Digambaras,
placing both hands on the ground, he spoke these words. ||93||  "O Bhagavans, I
request you to be pleased with me, and accept this excellent alms prepared by
me." ||94||  On hearing this, the Bhagavan said, "O Bharata, this is not
suitable. Such alms, prepared for the sake of the ascetics, are not suitable for
them." ||95||

64 Padmapurana These are free from greed, having conquered their senses,
enemies. They are great in virtue, having observed fasts for many months. ||96||
They stand in silence, free from fault. They eat for the sake of preserving
life, for life is the cause of Dharma. ||97|| They practice Dharma for the sake
of liberation, where there is no suffering for any beings. They desire the well-
being of all beings. ||98|| Hearing these words, the king pondered for a long
time. "Oh, what a great hardship this vow of the Jains is!" ||99|| The sages
dwell there, free from desire even in their own bodies. They are steadfast,
wearing the form of the sky, compassionate to all beings. ||100|| Now I will
feed these who have taken refuge in the vow of the house-holder. I will mark
them with a golden thread, with great devotion. ||101|| I will give them other
gifts as well, out of devotion. The Dharma that they have embraced is a younger
brother of the Dharma of the monks. ||102|| Then he sent his trusted men with
great speed to invite all the right-seeing people on earth. ||103|| A great
commotion arose throughout the land. People said, "Oh, people! King Bharata is
eager to make a great gift." ||104|| "Therefore, rise up, let us go, bring
clothes, jewels, and other wealth. See, these servants have been sent by him
with respect." ||105|| Hearing this, some of them said, "This Bharata only
honors his own right-seeing people, so it is useless for us to go there."
||106|| Hearing this, the right-seeing people, filled with great joy, went to
Bharata with their wives and children, and stood with humility. ||107|| The
wrong-seeing people also came, driven by greed for wealth, pretending to be
right-seeing, to the palace of King Bharata, which resembled the palace of
Indra. ||108|| King Bharata had the courtyard of his palace decorated with
sprouts of rice, green gram, black gram, etc., and honored all the right-seeing
people with these decorations. ||109||

### Fourth Chapter  Chaturtha Parva  The house was entered by that one marked
with the beautiful golden thread, adorned with countless gems. Those afflicted
with delusion and desire, agitated by contemplation, were speaking pitiable
words and were plunged into the ocean of suffering.   Then, as desired, the king
Bharat gave donations to those Śrāvakas. In the hearts of those who received the
honor, a sense of ego arose, and they began to think, "We are indeed great
purifiers and the benefactors of the world; that is why the king of kings Bharat
worships us with great reverence."   Consequently, filled with this pride, they
spread across the entire surface of the earth and began to beg when they saw
some wealthy individuals. Later, on a certain day, the minister Matismudra said
to king Bharat, "Today I have heard the following words in the assembly of the
Lord."   It was said that what Bharat had created for these Brāhmaṇas would
become hypocritical and very audacious in the impending age of Kali following
the rise of the flourishing Tīrthankara.   Those deluded by the essence of
Dharma would kill living beings, filled with great passion and ever eager to
commit sins. They would proclaim the false scriptures, the Vedas, as devoid of
their creators, misleading all beings.   Engaged in great endeavours, they would
accept donations and would always slander the teachings of Lord Jinendra.
Seeing the naked Munis ahead, the sinners would become filled with anger and
would be like the seedlings of a poisonous tree, harmful to the world,
constantly producing misfortune.   Hearing the words of Minister Matismudra,
Bharat, angered, prepared to kill all those Brāhmaṇas. Subsequently, they,
frightened, sought refuge with Lord Ṛṣabhadeva.   Lord Ṛṣabhadeva, saying, "O
son! Do not harm them (ma hananam kār̥ṣīḥ)," protected them, and henceforth they
became known by the title 'Māhana.'   Since these Brāhmaṇas, who had taken
refuge in Lord Jinendra, were protected by him, the gods and the wise revered
the Lord.

The kings who followed the path of the Lord, having fallen from their kingdom,
established different vows according to their own intellect. ||12|| Their
disciples and grand-disciples, intoxicated with pride, misled the world with
false arguments and created many false scriptures. ||125|| Bhrigu, Angishiras,
Agni, Kapila, Atri, and Vid, along with many others, became ascetics, wearing
bark due to ignorance. ||126|| Seeing women, their minds became polluted, and
they saw lust in their genitals. Therefore, those low, deluded beings covered
their genitals with a loincloth. ||127|| The Brahmanas, who were created by the
Chakravarti Bharat like seeds, with the sacred thread (Yajnopaveet) around their
necks, have now spread throughout the earth like progeny. ||128|| Gautama
Ganadhar says to King Shrenik, "O King! I have told you about the creation of
the Brahmanas as per the context. Now listen attentively as I tell you the main
point." ||129|| Lord Rishabhdev, having liberated countless beings from the
ocean of existence, attained liberation on the peak of Mount Kailash. ||130||
After that, Chakravarti Bharat, abandoning his kingdom, which was a cause of
wonder for the world, like a blade of grass, also attained initiation. ||131|| O
Shrenik! I have briefly explained to you the authority of the state. Now, listen
respectfully as I tell you about the authority of the lineage, O noble man.
||132|| Thus ends the fourth chapter of the Padmacharita, composed by Acharya
Ravishena, known as the Arsha-nama, which describes the greatness of Rishabhdev.

The Fifth Chapter  In this world, four great dynasties are renowned, O king.
Their subdivisions, replete with mysteries, have been expounded in many ways.
||1||  The first among them is the illustrious Ikshvaku dynasty, the ornament of
the world. The second is the spotless Rishivamsha or Chandravamsha. ||2||  The
third is the extremely captivating dynasty of the learned, and the fourth is the
renowned Harivamsha. ||3||  From the Ikshvaku dynasty was born Bhagavan
Rishabhadeva, whose son was the mighty Bharata. From him arose Sitayasha, whose
son was Balanka. ||4||  From him was born the mighty Subalah, and from him the
extremely powerful Amritashabdita. ||5||  Subhadra, Sagara, Bhadra, Ravitejas,
Shashi, Prabhutatejas, Tejasvi, Tapana, the mighty Ativivarya, Suveerya, the
renowned for his prowess, Mahendravikrama, Surya, Indradyumna, Mahendrajit,
||6-7||  Prabhu, Vibhu, Avidhvamsi, Vitabhee, Rishabhadhvaja, Garudanka,
Mriganka, and other great kings of the earth - ||8||  Relinquishing their
kingdoms to their sons, fearful of the ocean of worldly existence, they became
detached even from their bodies, embracing the vow of non-attachment. ||9||
Thus, I have narrated to you the lineage of the Solar dynasty, O king. Now, the
origin of the Lunar dynasty is described. ||10||  Rishabhadeva had a son named
Bahubali. From him was born the gentle Somayasha. ||11||  Then was born the
mighty Mahabala, and from him came Subalah, known as Bhujabali. These were the
initial kings of this dynasty. ||12||  Those born in the Lunar dynasty, with
pure conduct, quickly attained the supreme state of asceticism. ||13||

Padmapurane  Some, with diminished karmas, enjoy the fruits of austerities. They
dwell in svarga and then quickly attain liberation. 14  This is the Somavamsha
that I have told you about. Now I shall narrate the lineage of the Vidyadharas
in brief. 15  Nami, the king of the Vidyadharas, had a son named Ratnamali. From
him was born Ratnavajra, then Ratnaratha, then Ratnacitra, then Candraratha,
then Vajrajangha, then Vajrasena, then Vajradamstra, then Vajradhvaja, then
Vajrayudha, then Vajra, then Suvajra, then Vajrabhrt, then Vajrabha, then
Vajrabahu, then Vajrasaṃjñaka, then Vajrāsya, then Vajrapani, then Vajrajatu,
then Vajravan. 16-19  Then there were Vidyunmukha, Suvaktra, Vidyudamstra,
Vidyudvan, Vidyudama, and Vidyudvega, also known as Vaidyuta. 20  Many such
heroic Vidyadhara kings have, in due course of time, attained the appropriate
abodes according to their deeds. 21  Some of them, entrusting their subjects to
their sons, took Jina diksha and attained siddhi, abandoning hatred and
attachment. 22  Some, unable to break free from the bondage of karma, enjoyed
the pleasures of celestial enjoyments through the mere proximity created by
their resolve. 23  Some, bound by the noose of karma due to strong attachment,
met their end there itself, like deer trapped in a net. 24  Then there was a
lord named Vidyudha, who was the master of both lineages, empowered by the
strength of his knowledge, and of lofty valor. 25  One day, while in the sky, he
saw the unattached Yogin Sañjayanta, established in the immovable posture, in
Videha. 26  Bringing him, Vidyudha established him on the mountain called
Pañcagiri, and urged the knowledgeable ones to kill him. 27

## The Fifth Chapter  The yogi, being struck by the Vidyaadharas with stones and
other things, remained equanimous, his mind not even slightly disturbed. ||28||
Then, while enduring this unbearable torment, the great sage Sanjayanta attained
the supreme knowledge, illuminating all things. ||29||  At that time,
Dharanendra, the sage's brother from a previous life, arrived. He took away all
the Vidyaadharas' knowledge, leaving them devoid of it and attaining complete
peace. ||30||  Then, filled with sorrow at the loss of their knowledge, they
humbly folded their hands and asked Dharanendra, "How can we regain our
knowledge?" Dharanendra replied, "You can regain your knowledge by enduring the
hardships of penance at the feet of Sanjayanta Muni. However, if you commit any
wrong deeds, even if you attain knowledge, it will be lost again. If you go
above the temple of the Arhat's image and the saints, even by mistake, your
knowledge will be lost instantly." ||31-33||  Following Dharanendra's
instructions, the Vidyaadharas performed penance at the feet of Sanjayanta Muni
and regained their knowledge. ||31-33||  After all this, Dharanendra, out of
curiosity, asked Sanjayanta Muni, "O Bhagavan! Why did the Vidyaadharas behave
in such a way towards you? Why did they take you away and why did they torment
you?" ||34||  Hearing Dharanendra's question, Bhagavan Sanjayanta Kevali said,
"While wandering in this world of four gatis, I was once a merchant named
Hitakar in a village called Shakat. I was very sweet-spoken, compassionate,
honest in nature, and devoted to the service of the saints." ||35-36||  "Later,
I became King Shrivardhan in the city of Kumudavati, dedicated to upholding
righteousness." ||37||  "In the same village, there lived a Brahmin who
practiced wrong penance and became a Kudev. He was expelled from there and
became my, Shrivardhan's, minister named Vahnishik. Although he was known as a
truth-speaker, he was very wicked and secretly engaged in wrong deeds."
||38-39||  "Once, this minister..." ||40||

In the Padma Purana, that merchant, by giving him knowledge, went to his house
as a slave. He brought the jewels to the merchant, who was suffering. ||4||
Then, taking all his possessions, the wicked Brahmin was expelled from the city.
He was poor and performed great austerities. ||42|| After dying, he became a god
in the Maheindra heaven, and from there he was cast down. He is the king of the
Vidyadharas, named Vidyudridha, with a strong voice. ||43|| My soul,
Srivardhana, also died after performing austerities and became a god in heaven.
From there, I was cast down to the Videha region and became Sanjayanta. ||44||

enraged and fainted. He has done this transgression, being under the control of
his karma. ||45|| That merchant named Niyamadutta, after performing austerities,
was born as you, the king of the Nagakumaras, with a noble mind. ||46|| Then,

her. ||40|| The queen's maid took the ring to the priest's house and showed it
to his wife, who gave her jewels in exchange. The queen returned those jewels to
the merchant Niyamadutta, who was very sad. Then, I took away all the wealth of
that wicked Brahmin and expelled him from the city. That poor Brahmin became
wise and performed excellent austerities. ||41-42|| Finally, after dying, he

The fifth festival was celebrated, and some of them, having bestowed their
wealth on their sons, attained the state of liberation after having destroyed
their karmas. ||55|| Thus, O King, this lineage of the Vidyadharas has been
described. Now, the avatar of the second Yuga is being described. ||56|| At the
end of the Yuga of the Lord Rishabhadeva, the ancient noble qualities on this
earth became degraded, the people's interest in the activities of the other
world became slack, and their supreme intellect became engrossed in the pursuit
of pleasure and wealth. ||57-58|| Then, when the kings born in the Ikshvaku
dynasty had passed away in due course, a king named Dharanidhara was born in the
city of Ayodhya. He had a son named Tridashanjay, who was a renowned holder of
Lakshmi, born to his queen, Sri Devi. His wife's name was Indurekha, and they
had a son named Jitashatru. ||59-60|| In the city of Podanpur, there lived a
king named Vyananda, who had a daughter named Vijaya, born to his queen,
Ambhojamala. King Tridashanjay arranged the marriage of Jitashatru with Vijaya,
and then he renounced the world and attained liberation on Mount Kailasa through
penance. ||61-62|| Then, according to the previous decree, Lord Ajitanatha was
born to them. Indra and the other gods performed the abhisheka and other
ceremonies just as they had done for Lord Rishabhadeva. ||63|| Since his father
had conquered all his enemies at the time of his birth, he became known as
'Ajita' on earth. ||64|| Lord Ajitanatha had many queens, including Sunayana,
Nanda, and others. All of them were so beautiful that even Indrani could not
match their beauty. ||65|| Once, Lord Ajita went to a beautiful garden with his
inner court. In the morning, he saw a large forest of blooming lotuses. ||66||
When he saw the same forest shrinking as the sun was about to set, he realized
the impermanence of Lakshmi and attained supreme detachment. ||67|| Then, after
asking his father, mother, and brothers, he renounced the world according to the
previous decree. ||68||

In the Padma Purana, ten thousand Kshatriyas, along with their kingdoms,
families, and possessions, renounced the world and took the vows. ||69||
Brahmadatta, the king of Ayodhya, offered a **Parana** (a meal after a fast) to
the Lord, who had observed a three-day fast. ||70|| After fourteen years, he
attained **Kevalgyan** (omniscience) and became an **Arhant** (a liberated
soul), revered by the entire world. ||71|| Just as Lord Rishabhdeva had
manifested thirty-four **Atishayas** (miraculous powers) and eight
**Pratiharayas** (miracles), so too did this Lord. ||72|| Ninety **Ganadharas**
(disciples) resided at his feet, and one hundred thousand **Sadhus** (ascetics)
shone like the sun. ||73|| Jitashatru had a younger brother named Vijay Sagar,
whose wife was Sumangala. They had a son named Sagar. ||74|| This Sagar, with
his auspicious form, became the second **Chakravarti** (universal monarch) and
gained immense fame throughout the world due to the nine **Nidhanas**
(treasures). ||75|| O Shrenik, listen to the story that unfolded during his
reign. In the southern region of the Bharat Kshetra, there was a city called
Chakravala. ||76|| In this city, there lived a king of the **Vidyadharas**
(celestial beings) named Purnnaghana. He was endowed with great power and
excelled in knowledge. He requested the hand of the daughter of Vihayastilka,
the king of the city of Vihayastilka. However, Vihayastilka, following the
advice of a **Nimittgyani** (a wise person who interprets omens), gave his
daughter to Sagar Chakravarti instead. ||77-78|| Meanwhile, a fierce battle
raged between King Vihayastilka and Purnnaghana. During this time,
Vihayastilka's son, Sahasranayan, fled with his sister. ||79|| After defeating
Vihayastilka, Purnnaghana entered the city but could not find the princess. He
then returned to his own city. ||80|| Upon hearing of his father's death,
Sahasranayan, filled with rage, was unable to do anything due to his weakness.
He lived in a forest infested with ferocious animals like Ashtapada, constantly
watching for Purnnaghana. ||81|| A magical horse carried Sagar Chakravarti to
the same forest where Sahasranayan resided. By chance, Sahasranayan's sister,
Utpalmati, saw the Chakravarti and informed her brother. ||82|| Sahasranayan was
overjoyed to hear this news and, with his sister's help, was brought before the
Chakravarti. ||83||

The Pkarma Parva  The king Sagara, the ruler of six continents, was greatly
pleased after obtaining the woman (Sthrirathna).  He was obeyed by all the
kings. ||8||  After obtaining the Vidyaadharas, Sahasranayan surrounded the city
of Poornadhan with a fortress like wall. ||45||  Then a great war broke out,
resulting in the destruction of many people. Sahasranayan killed Poornamegh.
||86||  The son of Poornadhan, named Toyadavaahan, was exiled from the city of
Chakravaala by his enemies and wandered in the sky. ||7||  He was pursued by
many angry Kshecharas.  He was very distressed and sought refuge in Ajitanath,
the cause of happiness for the three worlds. ||48||  Then Vajradhara asked him
the reason for his fear.  Sagara reached the ocean and said that his relatives
had been killed. ||89||  There was a feud between our fathers, which resulted in
the destruction of many lives.  Due to the influence of that karma,
Sahasranayan, with a cruel heart, ||10||  has been harassing me with the power
of Sagara Chakravarti.  I have quickly come here from the palace, flying with
the swans. ||11||  Then the kings who were pursuing Meghavaahan told
Sahasranayan that he was near Ajitanath and they could not capture him.  Hearing
this, Sahasranayan, filled with anger, went himself and thought to himself, "Who
else is stronger than me who can protect him?"  Thinking this, he reached the
Samavasaran of the Jina. ||12-13||  As soon as he saw the halo of the Jina from
afar, all his pride was shattered.  He abandoned all his arrogance and bowed to
the great Ajitanath. ||14||  Both Sahasranayan and Meghavaahan, abandoning their
enmity, stood near the feet of the Jina.  Then the Ganadhara asked the Jina
about the history of their fathers.  The Jina said, ||15|| "In the Jambudvipa,
in the Bharat Kshetra, there was a city called Sadrutu.  There lived a merchant
named Bhavan.  He had a wife named Aataki and a son named Haridas.  Although
Bhavan was very wealthy, he was very troubled. ||16||

The Fifth Chapter  Knowing thus the suffering of their fathers, they (Sahastra-
nayan and Meghavahan) abandoned the enmity, the cause of worldly existence,
which had been aroused in them. ||112||  Then the Chakravarti asked them about
the cause of their enmity in their previous birth. The Lord, the master of the
Dharmachakra, explained the cause of their enmity as follows. ||113||  He said
that in the city of Padmaka, in the Bharat Kshetra of Jambudvipa, there lived a
famous man named Rambha, who was a scholar of Sankhya Shastra and very wealthy.
||114||  He had two disciples, Chandra and Avalli, who were both very famous,
wealthy, and virtuous, and were united in friendship. ||115||  Rambha, who was
skilled in the science of politics, thought that if these two remained united,
his position would be threatened, so he created a rift between them. ||116||
One day, Chandra wanted to buy a cow and went to the Gopalaka to negotiate the
price. He was on his way home when, by chance, he met Avalli, who was also
coming from the village after buying the same cow. In a fit of anger, Chandra
killed him. Avalli died and became a Mlechchha. ||117-118||  Chandra died and
became a bull, and the Mlechchha, due to the bond of enmity, killed him and ate
him. ||119||  The Mlechchha, being a Tiryanchnaraka, was born as a rat. Chandra,
who had become a bull, was reborn as a cat, and the cat killed and ate the rat.
||120||  Due to their evil deeds, both were born in hell, where they suffered
great pain in the ocean of existence. ||121||  After being released from hell,
they were born in Kashi as the sons of a slave woman named Sambhramadevi. Their
names were Kutta and Karpatika. They were both slaves and worked as servants.
Sambhramadevi appointed them to the Jina temple. After their death, due to their
good deeds, they were reborn as Vyantara Devas named Rupananada and Surupa.
||122-123||  Rupananada was the soul of Chandra and Surupa was the soul of
Avalli. Rupananada was born as a son of a noble family named Kulandhara in the
city of Rajoavali, and Surupa was born as the son of a priest named Pushpabhuti.

76 Padmapurana Although Kulandhara and Pushpabhuti were both friends, they
became enemies because of a cart driver. As a result, Kulandhara was determined
to kill Pushpabhuti. || 125 || On the way, he met a Muni Raja seated under a
tree and became peaceful after listening to Dharma from him. The king tested him
and made him a Mandaleshwar due to the influence of punya. || 126 || Pushpabhuti
saw that Kulandhara had attained wealth through the influence of Dharma, so he
also became a Jain and died, becoming a deva in the third heaven. || 127 ||
Kulandhara also became a deva in the same third heaven. Both of them fell and
were born as sons of Arija and Jayavati in the Dhaatki Khand island, in the
western Videha region. One was named Kruramara and the other Dhanshrusti. Both
these brothers were very brave and famous servants, trusted by the king
Sahasrashirsha. || 128 - 129 || One day, King Sahasrashirsha went to the forest
with both his servants to catch an elephant. There, he saw lions and deer, who
were naturally enemies, loving each other. || 130 || "Why are these violent
creatures peaceful?" Wondering this, as soon as King Sahasrashirsha entered the
great forest, his eyes fell upon the great Muni Kevali Bhagwan. || 131 || After
that, King Sahasrashirsha, along with both his servants, took initiation from
Kevali Bhagwan. As a result, the king attained moksha, and Kruramara and
Dhanshrusti went to the Shatar heaven. || 132 || Of these, the Chandra jiva
Kruramara became Meghavahana after falling from heaven, and the Avali jiva
Dhanshrusti became Sahasranayana. Thus, there is enmity between them due to
their previous birth. || 133 || After that, Sagar Chakravarti asked Bhagwan, "O
Prabhu! Why do I have more affection for Sahasranayana?" In reply, Bhagwan said,
"The one named Rambha, who was a scholar of Ganit Shastra, became an Arya in the
deva kul due to feeding the Munis. Then he went to the Saudharma heaven, and
from there, he fell and was born as a beloved son named Vratakirtan of King Hari
and Queen Dhara in the Chandrapur city. He attained the Muni pad and went to
heaven, and from there, he fell and was born as a son named Payobal of King
Mahaghoosha and Queen Chandrini in the Ratna Sanchay city of the western Videha
region. He became a Muni 1. Sthiti M., Sthita K. 2. Jayavati M, Jayavati K. 3.

## The Fifth Chapter  Having fallen from the fourteenth heaven called Pranata,
he was born as Jayakirtana, the son of King Yashodhara and Queen Jaya in the
city of Prithvipura in the Bharat Kshetra. || 138 ||  He took initiation from
his father and was born in the Vijay Vimana, and from there he fell and became
the Chakravarti Sagra. || 139 ||  When you were Rambha, you had great affection
for Avali. Now Avali has become Sahasranayan. Therefore, due to past karma, you
still have a strong affection for him. || 140 ||  Thus, both Meghavahana and
Sahasraksha, having learned about their past lives from the mouth of the Jina,
developed a great interest in Dharma. || 141 ||  Due to that religious interest,
both of them remembered their past lives. Then, filled with faith, Meghavahana
and Sahasranayan began to praise the Jina, Ajitanatha, in this way: || 142 ||
"O Bhagavan! You, without any reason, do good to those worldly beings who are
devoid of intelligence and have no protector. What greater wonder can there be
than this?" || 143 ||  "Your form is beyond comparison, and you are the
possessor of immeasurable strength. O Lord! In these three worlds, who is there
who has been satisfied by seeing you?" || 144 ||  "O Bhagavan! Although you have
attained all that is attainable, are accomplished, all-seeing, blissful,
inconceivable, and have known all that is knowable, yet you are still engaged in
the welfare of the world." || 145 ||  "O Supreme Jina! You are the giver of the
hand of support to the beings who are falling into the abyss of existence, in
the form of the teachings of the essence of Dharma." || 146 ||  Thus,
Meghavahana and Sahasranayan, whose speech was choked with emotion and whose
eyes were filled with tears, having attained supreme joy, bowed down and sat in
their respective places. || 147 ||  The Munis like Simhaviriya, the Devas like
Indra, and the Kings like Sagra, all attained supreme wonder. || 148 ||  Then,
in the Samavasarana of the Jina, the Indra of the Rakshasas, Bhima and Subhima,
happily said to Meghavahana: "O child of the Vidyadharas! You are blessed to
have come to the refuge of the all-knowing Ajita Jina. We are both pleased with
you. Therefore, we will tell you what will ensure your well-being in all ways.
Listen carefully. You are worthy of our protection." || 149 - 151 ||

In the salt ocean, filled with fearsome crocodiles, there are thousands of
extremely inaccessible and beautiful continents. || 152 || In some of these
continents, Gandharvas play, in some, groups of Kinnaras, in some, hordes of
Yakshas, and in some, Kimpurusha Devas. || 153 || Among these continents, there
is a continent called Rakshasa Dweep, which is a place of auspicious play for
Rakshasas. It is said to be seven hundred yojanas long and wide. || 154 || In
the middle of this Rakshasa Dweep, there is a huge mountain called Trikutachal,
similar to Mount Meru. This mountain is extremely difficult to enter and
provides refuge to all with its excellent cave-like houses. || 155 || Its peak
is as beautiful as the top of Mount Sumeru, nine yojanas high and fifty yojanas
wide. || 156 || Its golden shores are always covered with a multitude of various
gems, and Kalpavriksha trees, embraced by various creepers, stand there in
abundance. || 157 || Below this Trikutachal, there is a city called Lanka,
thirty yojanas wide, inhabited by the Rakshasa lineage. Its palaces are made of
various gems and gold. || 158 || With its captivating gardens, lotus-filled
lakes, and large Jain temples, this city seems like Indrapuri. || 159 || This
Lanka city is like an ornament of the southern direction. O Vidyadhar! Go to

the Rakshasas, Bheem, gave him a garland adorned by Devas. This garland was
emitting moonlight with its millions of rays. || 161 || He gave him this garland
out of love for his son from a previous birth and said, "O Vidyadhar! You are
the last-bodied and the best person of this age, therefore, this garland is
given to you." || 162 || Besides this garland, he also gave him a natural city
hidden within the earth, six yojanas deep and one hundred and thirty-five
yojanas and one and a half kalas wide. || 163 || It was impossible for enemies
to enter this city, even with their minds. It had large palaces, its name was
Alankaroday, and its beauty was like heaven. || 164 || If you are ever attacked
by the Parachakra, take refuge in this city and stay safe. This is a secret safe
place for your lineage. || 165 || Thus, the king of the Rakshasas, Bheem, 1.

## Fifth Chapter  Thus addressed by the Rakshasa chiefs, the son of Purnghana
attained supreme joy. He bowed down to the Lord Ajita.  ||166||  Having obtained
the Rakshasa knowledge and mounting the swift, desired-going chariot named
Kamaga, he set out for that city. ||167||  Knowing that this boon had been
granted to him by the Rakshasas, all his relatives were filled with joy, like a
cluster of lotuses blooming at dawn. ||168||  Vimala, Amala, Kanta, and others,
with their wealth of knowledge, arrived quickly, filled with joy, and greeted
him with sweet words. ||169||  Surrounded by his joyful relatives, he set out
for Lanka. Some of the Vidyadharas walked beside him, some behind, some ahead,
some riding on elephants, some on horses. Some chanted victory cries, some
played melodious drums, some provided shade with white umbrellas, and some were
adorned with flags and garlands. ||170-171||  The assembly of Vidyadharas,
showering blessings and paying respects, accompanied him. As he traveled through
the sky, he saw the salty ocean, vast like the sky, deep like the netherworld,
dark like a Tamala forest, and filled with waves. ||172-173||  Those traveling
with him said, "Look, there is a mountain in the water, there is a great
crocodile leaping, and there is a huge fish swimming nearby." ||174||  Gazing at
the beauty of the ocean, Meghavahana entered Lanka, situated below the peak of
Trikuta mountain. Lanka was adorned with massive ramparts and towers, its red
hue staining the sky like twilight, adorned with white flags like Kunda flowers,
and decorated with Jain temples, complete with walls and arches. ||175-176||
Entering Lanka, he first went to the Jain temple and paid homage to the Jina.
Then, he resided in his own suitable palace, filled with auspiciousness. ||177||
His other relatives also stayed in their respective palaces, their eyes and rows
of eyes captivated by the splendor of jewels. ||178||

In the Purana, known as the Kinnara Gita, there was a princess named Suprabha,
born to King Ratimuyukha and Queen Anumati.  She was a thief of hearts and eyes,
a dweller in the abode of love, a moon-like being who blossomed like a Kumudini,
a lake of beauty, an ornament of ornaments, and a bringer of joy to all beings.
King Meghavahana married her with great pomp and splendor.  [179-181]  After
that, Meghavahana, the king whose command was obeyed by all the celestial
beings, resided in Lanka for a long time, just as Indra resides in heaven.
[182]  Some time later, King Meghavahana, who desired a son, was blessed with a
son.  This son, following the family tradition, was named Maharaks.  [183]  One
day, King Meghavahana went to the Samavasarana of Ajitanatha Bhagwan to pay his
respects.  After offering his salutations, he sat down in his designated place
with great humility.  [184]  When the other stories had come to an end, Emperor
Sagar, with his hands folded in respect, asked Ajitanatha Jinendra, [185]  "O
Bhagwan! In this Avasarpini, how many more Tirthankaras will there be, like you,
who are the masters of the Dharmachakra?"  [186]  "And how many Tirthankaras
have already passed, who brought happiness to the three worlds?  Indeed, the
birth of beings like you is a wonder in the three worlds."  [187]  "How many
Chakravartis will there be, adorned with fourteen jewels and the Sudarshan
Chakra, the holders of Lakshmi?  Similarly, how many Balabhadra, Narayana, and
Pratinarayana will there be?"  [188]  Thus, when Emperor Sagar asked these
questions, Bhagwan Ajitanatha replied with the following words.  His words were
like the deep sound of a divine drum, rejecting the great path and bringing joy
to the ears.  [189]  The language of the Bhagwan was Ardhamagadhi, and his lips
did not move while he spoke.  This was a great wonder.  [190]  He said, "O
Sagar! In every Utsarpini and Avasarpini, there are twenty-four Tirthankaras,
each of whom establishes the Dharma Tirtha."  [191]  At the time when this
entire world was enveloped in the dense darkness of delusion, devoid of the
awareness of Dharma, a home for all hypocrisy, and without a king, [192]

---------------------------
The Fifth Chapter  When, at that time, the great Jina, Nābheya, arose, O King,
by him was established the "former time," the Kṛtayuga. ||193|| Three castes
were conceived by him, according to the difference in actions. The origin of
grains arose from the rain of the Kalpa. ||194|| In his time were created the
great ones, the Sūtradhāras, by his son, Bharata, of equal brilliance to him.
||195|| The āśrama also arose, distinguished as sāgara and anāgara. Knowledge
and arts were taught by Nābheya himself. ||196|| Embracing initiation, by him,
those who were destined for liberation, were freed from the fire of birth-
suffering, and led to happiness by the water of peace. ||197|| Even if the three
worlds were to gather together, they would not be able to comprehend the
incomparable qualities of Nābheya, who was adorned with the brilliance of his
own self. ||198|| He who ascended the eight-stepped mountain for the shedding of
his body, was seen by the gods and demons, with wonder, like a golden peak.
||199|| Taking refuge in that Lord, the sages, Bharata and others, attained the
state of liberation, having embraced the great vows. ||200|| Some, having
acquired merit, attained the happiness of heaven. Others, endowed with natural
simplicity, attained the highest human state. ||201|| Others, though his
doctrine was most brilliant, did not see it, being bound by the delusion of
attachment, like owls who cannot see the sun. ||202|| They, embracing evil
conduct, becoming evil gods, wander in the hells, again as animals, with evil
deeds. ||203|| After a long time had passed, when the ocean-like profound
Nābheya's yuga-tirtha was broken, and the religious festival was destroyed, I,
the second Jina, Ajitanātha, arose, to establish the Kṛtayuga, for the benefit
of all beings. ||204-205|| When the proper Dharma becomes weak, due to the
violation of the rules of conduct and the prosperity of the deluded, the Jinas
arise and revive it. ||206|| Having attained him, again, the beings, the best of
friends, embrace him again, and become destined for the state of liberation.

In the Padma Purana, after my departure, twenty-two Jinas will arise,
illuminating the three worlds in succession.  ||20|| They will all be adorned
with brilliance, valor, and other qualities, like me. They will be worshipped by
the beings of the three worlds, serving as an example. ||209|| After enjoying
the wealth of a Chakravartin, the Jinas among them will attain the kingdom of
knowledge, the cause of infinite happiness. ||210|| I will now speak of the
names of all these great souls, names that are auspicious in the three worlds
and, O King Sagar, will purify your mind. ||211||  Rishabha, the best among men,
was the first Jina, who has already passed. I am Ajita, the present Jina, and
the remaining twenty-two are the future Jinas. ||212|| Sambhava, the cause of
liberation, Abhinandana, the delight of the worthy beings,  Sumati, Padma
Prabha,  Suparshva, Chandra Prabha, Pushpadanta, the destroyer of the eight
karmas,  Shitala, the ocean of good conduct, Shreyans, the benefactor through
excellent deeds, Vasupujya, worshipped by the virtuous,  Vimala, Ananta, Dharma,
Shanti, Kuntha, Ara, Mallinatha, Suvrata, Naminatha,  Neminatha, Parshvanatha,
and Vira, the upholder of the Jina path. These are the twenty-four Tirthankaras
of this Avasarpini Yuga. They will all be the lords of the gods and the
benefactors of beings. ||213-216|| The birth and descent of all of them will be
celebrated with a shower of jewels, and the gods will anoint them with the water
of the ocean of milk on Mount Meru. ||217|| Their brilliance, form, happiness,
and strength will be beyond comparison, and all of them will destroy the enemy
of birth in this world, that is, they will attain liberation. ||218|| When the
sun in the form of Lord Mahavira sets, many fireflies of hypocrisy will appear
in this world. ||219|| These hypocrites will fall into the well of the four
gatis of this world, and they will also cause other ignorant beings to fall.
||220|| One Chakravartin, like you, with the mark of the wheel, the lord of
wealth, will arise. One Mahavira, with great strength, will be born in the ten
future kalpas. ||221||

## Fifth Chapter  **The First Chakravarti, Bharata, has passed away, and you,
Sagara, are the second. There will be ten more Chakravartis, all marked by the
wheel.** (222)  **The Chakravartis are:** 1. Sanatkumara, 2. Maghava, 3. Shanti,
4. Kunthu, 5. Ara, 6. Subhumi, 7. Mahapadma, 8. Harishena, 9. Jayasena, and 10.
Brahmadatta. (223)  **There will be nine Vasudevas, accompanied by nine
Pratishwaras. There will also be nine Balabhadra, all with minds devoted to
Dharma.** (224-225)  **O King! Just as we have described the Tirthankaras,
Chakravartis, etc. in the Avasarpini Kala, so too will there be Tirthankaras,
etc. in the Utsarpini Kala, in the realms of Bharata and Airavata.** (226)
**Hearing about the cycle of birth and death due to karma, the rise of great
souls, and the transformation of time, the wise Meghavahana pondered in his
mind:** (227-228)  **Alas! It is a great sorrow that this living being,
intoxicated by the intoxicating wine of delusion, is driven by the very karmas
that cause him suffering.** (229)  **What is the point of loving things that
appear pleasant at first but are like poison in the end, or whose very nature is
to cause suffering?** (230)  **Even after spending a long time attached to
wealth, women, and relatives, one must journey through the world alone.** (231)
**Just as a puppy follows its master as long as it receives food, so too do all
beings in this world remain attached to those who give them something.** (232)
**So much time has passed, yet who has gone to the other world with their
relatives, spouses, friends, or loved ones?** (233)  **The pleasures of the five
senses are like the body of a snake, terrifying and leading to hell. What
sentient being would be attached to such things?** (234)  **Oh, what a great
wonder it is that Lakshmi, when she is approached with devotion, deceives those
who rely on her. What could be more wicked than this?** (235)

In the Padma Purana, The gathering of relatives is like a dream, fleeting like a
rainbow. The happiness derived from it is like a fleeting moment, like the arc
of Indra. ||236|| The body is like a water bubble, devoid of essence, and life
is like a flash of lightning, fleeting. ||237|| Therefore, abandoning all this,
the cause of worldly existence, I embrace Dharma, the unwavering companion.
||238|| Leaving behind the kingdom for his son, Maharaksasa, the wise
Meghavahana, adorned with the armor of detachment, went to the presence of
Ajitanatha. ||239|| Along with him, one hundred and ten other celestial beings,
having attained detachment, left their homes, the prison of worldly life.
||240|| This Maharaksasa, like the moon, illuminated the celestial court with
the rays of his generosity, stirring the ocean of relatives. ||241|| Such was
his influence that even in dreams, the lords of the great celestial beings
received his commands, waking up in a state of awe, joining their hands and
touching their foreheads. ||242|| His beloved, Vimalaabha, was like a shadow,
always by his side. ||243|| He had three sons, Amararaks, Uddharaks, and
Bhanuraks, all of whom were perfect in every way. ||244|| They were filled with
diverse deeds, noble in character, and expansive in their wealth and
possessions, making them seem like the three worlds themselves. ||245||
Ajitanatha, the Lord, having guided the liberated souls towards liberation,
reached the summit of Sammed Shikhar, where he attained his true nature, the
state of Siddha. ||246|| Like the queen of Indra, Sagar Chakravarti had ninety-
six thousand wives, all possessing radiant brilliance, and sixty thousand sons,
all endowed with supreme power and shining like jeweled pillars. These sons also
had numerous offspring. ||247-248|| Once, all these sons went to Kailasa to pay
their respects, their footsteps shaking the earth like mountains. ||249||

## Fifth Chapter  Having paid homage to the Siddha images with great reverence,
they began to dig a trench around the mountain with their Danda-ratna. || 250 ||
Seeing the earth dug down to the roots of the earth, the Naga-indra, inflamed
with anger, looked at them. || 251 || The sons of the Chakravarti, whose bodies
were consumed by the flames of the Naga-indra's anger, were reduced to ashes. ||
252 || Just as there is a life-giving power amidst the deadly power of poison,
which sometimes acts as a medicine and becomes the cause of life, so also in the
anger of the Naga-indra, where there was the power to burn, there was also a
compassionate outcome. Due to this compassionate outcome, two sons, Bhima and
Bhagiratha, were somehow not burnt to ashes. || 253 || Seeing this sudden death
of the sons of the Chakravarti Sagar, both of them were grieved and went to
Sagar. || 254 || Fearing that the Chakravarti might suddenly lose his life upon
hearing this news, the learned men forbade Bhima and Bhagiratha from telling the
Chakravarti this news. || 255 || Then the king, the hereditary ministers, the
learned men who were experts in various scriptures, and the wise men who were
connoisseurs of entertainment, gathered together and went to the Chakravarti. At
that time, there was no difference in the radiance of their faces, and their
attire was also the same as before. All of them went to the Chakravarti Sagar
with reverence, just as before. || 256-257 || After paying their respects and
sitting in their respective places, an elder, prompted by their gestures, began
to speak these words. || 258 ||  O King Sagar! You see the impermanence of the
world, seeing which the mind does not turn towards the world. || 259 || Before
you, there was a king named Bharat, who was equal to you in prowess, who had
subdued this six-part earth, making it like a slave. || 260 || He had a son
named Arka-kirti, who was a great warrior, and whose name this solar dynasty is
still known by. || 261 || Arka-kirti also had a son, and his son also had a son,
but now all of them have gone beyond the reach of sight. || 262 ||

## 86  **Verse 263:** Even if they are the lords of the celestial realms,
adorned with splendor, they are reduced to ashes by sorrow in an instant.
**Verse 264:** Even the Tirthankaras, the ones who bring joy to the three
worlds, abandon their bodies when their lifespan ends.  **Verse 265-266:** Just
as birds, after spending the night on a large tree, fly in all directions at
dawn, similarly, many beings, after gathering together in a family, go their
separate ways according to their karma.  **Verse 267:** Some have witnessed the
actions and beautiful bodies of those ancient beings with their own eyes, but we
only know them through stories.  **Verse 268:** Death is stronger than all the
powerful beings, for it has conquered all the powerful.  **Verse 269:** Oh, what
a wonder! Our chests don't burst when we remember the destruction of great souls
like Bharata and others.  **Verse 270:** The wealth, loved ones, and bodies of
beings are like foam, waves, rainbows, dreams, lightning, and acacia blossoms.
**Verse 271:** There is no human in the world who can be compared to this, that
just as this is immortal, so are we.  **Verse 272-273:** Those who are capable
of drying up the ocean filled with crocodiles, or grinding Mount Meru to dust
with their hands, or lifting the earth and swallowing the moon and sun, even
they have entered the mouth of Yama, the god of death, in due time.  **Verse
274:** All beings in the three worlds are subject to this insurmountable death.
Only the Siddhas, born from the Jain Dharma, are free from it.  **Verse 275:**
Just as many kings have met their end due to time, so shall we also meet our
end. This is the common law of the world.  **Verse 276:** When this common
thing, death, comes to all beings in the three worlds, who, with a wise mind,
will grieve for the cause of existence?  **Verse 277:** As this discussion was
going on, the wise Chakravarti, skilled in observing actions, saw only two sons
in front of him. Seeing them, he began to think in his mind.  **Note:** The term
"Tirthankara" is a Jain term referring to a spiritual teacher who has attained
liberation and guides others to do the same. The term "Siddha" refers to a
liberated soul who has attained perfect knowledge and is free from the cycle of
birth and death.

The fifth festival, all the sons always used to salute me together. Today, only
two sons are seen, and even their faces are very humble. It seems that the
remaining sons have attained destruction. ||278|| These arrived kings are not
able to speak this great sorrow directly, so they are speaking through other
means. ||279|| After that, even though Sagara Chakravarti was bitten by the
snake of sorrow, he did not give up his life, receiving comfort from the words
of the assembly members. ||280|| Knowing the world's happiness to be as empty as
the core of a banana, he gave the kingdom's wealth to Bhagiratha and took
initiation himself. ||281|| When this great-souled king was leaving this earth,
this earth adorned with various cities and mines of gold, etc., seemed as
insignificant as dry grass to his mind. ||282|| After that, Sagara Chakravarti,
along with his son Bhimratha, took refuge in Ajitanatha Bhagwan. There, he took
initiation, attained omniscience, and then took refuge in the Siddha-pad, i.e.,
he became liberated. ||283|| Sagara Chakravarti's son Jahnu's son Bhagiratha
became the king. One day, he asked Shruta Sagar Muni Raja. ||284|| "Why did all
my grandfather Sagara's sons attain death together due to the rise of what
karma, and why am I saved from that karma even though I was among them?" ||285||
Bhagwan Ajitanatha said, "Once, the four-fold assembly was going to pay homage
to Sammed Shikhar, and on the way, they reached a village called Antik." ||286||
Seeing the assembly, all the people of that Antik village started laughing at
the assembly, speaking abusive words. But there was a potter in that village,
who stopped all the villagers and praised the assembly. ||287|| A man living in
that village had committed theft, so the unwise king thought that this village
itself is committing many crimes, so he surrounded it and burnt the whole
village. ||288|| On the day that village was burnt, the potter, who was the
holder of the middle results, was invited somewhere and had gone out. ||289||
When the potter died, he became a very wealthy merchant, and all the villagers
died and became cowries. The merchant bought all those cowries. ||290|| After
that, the potter's soul died and became a king, and the souls of the villagers
died and became 1. Ath M. ||291||

In the Padma Purana, The king, having become a Shraman, was cast down from the
position of a deity. He was born as Bhagiratha, and the villagers became the
sons of Sagara. ||292|| By slandering the Sangha, one meets death in every
birth. Therefore, that entire village was destroyed at once, while you, by
praising the Sangha, have become prosperous and long-lived. ||293|| Having heard
this account of his past life from the Lord, Bhagiratha became calm and,
becoming the chief of the sages, attained a position suitable for penance.
||294|| Gautama Swami says to King Shrenik, "O King! Having obtained the
opportunity, I have told you this story of Sagara. Now, I will tell you the
present story, so listen." ||295|| There was a great Rakshasa named Maharaksha,
who ruled Lanka without any obstacles. He was endowed with great knowledge and
power. One day, he went to a pleasure garden with his wives, adorned with lotus-
covered ponds, a play-mountain towering with the brilliance of various gems,
adorned with groups of trees bearing blooming flowers, filled with groups of
birds flitting about with indistinct sweet sounds, surrounded by a gem-studded
earth, where various kinds of radiance were blooming, and adorned with arbors of
creepers with the appropriate shade of dense foliage. ||296-300|| King
Maharaksha began to play in that pleasure garden with his wives. Sometimes the
women would tease him with flowers, and sometimes he would tease the women with
fruits. ||301|| If any woman became angry due to jealousy because of another
woman going near him, he would appease her by bowing at her feet. Similarly, if
he himself became angry, a woman full of playfulness would appease him. ||302||
Sometimes he would inspire a woman with his chest, which was as beautiful as the
shore of Trikuta Mountain, and another woman would inspire him with the embrace
of her full breasts. ||303|| Seeing the hidden bodies of the women immersed in
play, he was like the king of the gods in Nandana, in the midst of the ocean of
love. ||304|| The king, having become a Jain, was reduced to dust by the
elephant, and all those Jains wandered in the cycle of births and deaths.
||291|| The potter's soul, having become a sage, attained the position of a
deity, and from there, having been cast down, you became Bhagiratha, and all the
villagers, having died, became the sons of Sagara. ||292|| By slandering the
Sangha, one meets death in every birth. Therefore, that entire village was

## The Fifth Chapter  Then, as the lotus buds began to close their petals, the
king saw a dead bee trapped within a lotus bud.    Seeing this, a thought arose
in his heart, a thought that would destroy his worldly attachments.  He thought,
"This foolish bee, intoxicated by the nectar, did not find satisfaction and thus
met its death.  The Acharya says, "May this endless desire be cursed!"  Just as
this bee, attached to the lotus, met its death, so too shall we, attached to the
lotus-like faces of women, meet our death.  If this bee died due to its sense of
smell and taste, then what of us, who are enslaved by all five senses?  Or
perhaps this bee, being a member of the lower species, is ignorant, and so its
actions are understandable.  But we, who are endowed with knowledge, why are we
still attached to these objects?  What pleasure is there in licking the blade of
a honey-coated sword, which, upon contact, shatters the tongue into a hundred
pieces?  What kind of happiness can arise from objects that, far from offering
pleasure, only bring forth a continuous stream of suffering?  I bow down to
those great souls who have turned away from objects like the fruit of the
*kipaak* tree, with their body, speech, and mind.  Alas, how unfortunate! I have
been deceived, cheated for a long time by these wicked objects, whose
attachments are extremely harmful and deadly like poison.  At that moment, a
great sage named Shruta Sagar, bearing a meaningful name, arrived in that
garden.  Shruta Sagar Muni was endowed with a most beautiful form, his radiance
put the moon to shame, his brilliance scorned the sun, and his steadfastness
defeated Mount Meru.  His soul was always absorbed in meditation on Dharma, free
from attachment and aversion.  He was a devotee of the *kshaayas* (passions),
and his association was like a broken staff.

Dharma, and then, after staying for a moment, asked about the nature of Dharma
with devotion. || 323 || Then, the Muni, whose heart was like a calm moon,
spoke, his words shining like the rays of a thousand suns. || 324 || "O King!
The Jina has declared non-violence and its virtues to be Dharma. Truthfulness

their karmas, go to different states of existence, and, being deluded by life,
they develop attachment to them." || 326 || "These beings, fearing death,
abandon the gains of the three worlds and desire life. Nothing is dearer to them
than life." || 327 || "What is the use of saying much? This can be known only

cherish their own lives." || 328 || "Therefore, those foolish beings who destroy

committed?" || 329 || "Having taken the lives of beings, they become burdened

## The Western Chapter  Those whose words are like honey but whose hearts are
filled with poison, who are controlled by their senses and whose minds are
immersed in the three periods of the day, are like cows that are milked three
times a day. (331)  Those who are devoid of proper conduct and act according to
their desires, these wicked beings wander in the cycle of animal births. (332)
It is rare for a being to obtain human birth, even rarer to be born beautiful,
even rarer to be wealthy, even rarer to be born into a noble family, even rarer
to acquire knowledge, even rarer to understand the nature of things, and even
rarer to attain the path of Dharma. (333-334)  Some, after practicing Dharma,
attain happiness in heaven, enjoying the company of gods and goddesses. (335)
But after falling from heaven, they are born in a womb, covered in excrement and
urine, filled with wriggling worms, foul-smelling and unbearable. (336)  In the
womb, these beings are covered in a membrane, surrounded by bile, phlegm, etc.,
and they lick the fluids of the mother's food that leak out through the
umbilical cord. (337)  Their entire body is compressed, and they are constantly
tormented by the weight of suffering. After living there, they are born again as
humans. (338)  From birth, these cruel beings are devoid of discipline, conduct,
and right vision. They are filled with sin and indulge in worldly pleasures.
(339)  Those who are enslaved by lust and have abandoned right conduct,
experience great suffering and wander in the ocean of existence. (340)  Words
that cause pain to others should be avoided with all effort, for such words lead
to violence, and violence is the cause of rebirth. (341)  Similarly, stealing,
adultery, and the desire for great wealth should all be abandoned, for they are
the causes of suffering. (342)  Hearing the teachings of Dharma from the mouth
of the sage, the king of the Vidyadharas, Maharaks, attained dispassion. He then
bowed to the sage and asked:  "How do some people directly fall into hell?"

The Shruta Sagar Muni, adorned with the four knowledges, sat humbly before the
Maharaksha Vidyadhara and said briefly:  "O King! In the city of Podanpur in the
Bharat Kshetra, there lived a man named Hit. His wife's name was Madhavi, and
you were their son, named Priti.  "In the same city of Podanpur, there reigned a
king named Hemarath, born to King Udayachala and Queen Arhacchee.  "One day, he
performed a grand puja in the Jain temple with great devotion, astonishing
everyone.  "Hearing the loud chants of 'Jai' during the puja, you too, filled
with joy, exclaimed 'Jai'.  "Overwhelmed with joy, you couldn't stay inside the
house and went out to dance in the courtyard, like a cloud dances at the sound
of thunder.  "As a result of the merit you accumulated from this act, you died
and became a Yaksha, bringing joy to the eyes of the Yakshas.  "Later, in the
city of Kanchanpur in the western Videha Kshetra, enemies began to harass the
monks.  "You separated those enemies and protected the monks engaged in their
religious practices. By doing so, you accumulated a vast amount of merit.  "From
there, you transmigrated to the Vidyadhara mountain, Taddidangad, and were born
as the son of the Vidyadhara, Udit, and Vidyadhari, Shri Prabha.  "Once, the
king of the Vidyadharas, named Amaravikram, came to pay homage to the monks.
Seeing him, you wished for such grandeur for yourself.  "After performing severe
austerities, you became a god in the Aishana heaven. From there, you
transmigrated and became the son of Meghavahana, the Maharaksha.  "Just as the
wheel of the sun's chariot constantly rotates, you too, under the influence of
your senses, the tongue and the female, have wandered through the world.  "If
all the bodies you have acquired and abandoned in other births were to be
gathered together, they would never fit in the three worlds.  "You were not
satisfied with the pleasures of the gods, which are enjoyed for millions of
kalpas, nor with the pleasures of the Vidyadharas, who can create their own
desires.  "Tell me about your previous birth."

The Fifth Chapter  How will you be satisfied with pleasures that are like a
dream or a magic show, lasting only eight days? Therefore, abandon the desire
for pleasures and embrace peace. ||359||  The Muni did not feel sorrow at the
approaching end of his life, but he did feel some regret, knowing that he would
have to take many more births in this cycle of existence. ||360||  He then
established his eldest son, Amarraksha, on the throne and made his younger son,
Bhanuraksha, the crown prince. ||361||  Renouncing all possessions, he became
devoted to the ultimate truth, becoming as steadfast as a pillar, free from
greed. ||362||  He abandoned all food and drink, maintaining his body only
through the power of his mind, remaining equanimous towards both friend and foe,
his mind unwavering. ||363||  He took the vow of silence and sat in the middle
of the Jina temple, performing a grand puja, a magnificent abhisheka. ||364||
His consciousness purified by the contemplation of the Arhat's feet, he became a
supreme deva, entering samadhi. ||365||  Later, Amarraksha married Rati, the
daughter of King Shridhara and Queen Vidya, in the city of Kinnarageeta. ||366||
Bhanuraksha married Gandharva, the daughter of King Surasannibha and Queen
Gandhari, in the city of Gandharvageeta. ||367||  Amarraksha had ten beautiful
sons and six daughters, adorned with virtues and beauty, like celestial nymphs.
||368||  Similarly, Bhanuraksha had ten sons and six daughters, whose fame
spread throughout the world. ||369||  O Shrenika, these victorious princes
established great and beautiful cities, each named after themselves. ||370||
Listen to the names of these cities: Sandhyakara, Suvela, Manohlada, Manohara,
Hansadwipa, Hari, Yodha, Samudra, Kanchana, and Ardhaswargotakrishta. These ten
cities, resembling heaven, were established by the sons of Amarraksha, who
possessed great intelligence and valor. ||371-372||

In the Padma Purana, ten cities were established by the sons of Bhanurakshaka:
1. Avarta, 2. Vighata, 3. Ambhoda, 4. Utkat, 5. Sphuta, 6. Durgraha, 7. Tat, 8.
Toya, 9. Avali, and 10. Ratnadvipa. ||373|| These cities were adorned with
various jewels and shone with the brilliance of golden walls, serving as the
abodes of the Rakshasas who desired amusement. ||374|| In those very islands,
the celestial beings residing in other islands constructed numerous cities with
great enthusiasm. ||375|| Subsequently, both Amararakska and Bhanurakshaka,
after bestowing their kingdom upon their sons, embraced the path of initiation
and, becoming possessors of the wealth of great austerities, attained the
eternal, liberated state. ||376|| Thus, the lineage of King Meghavahana,
characterized by great men who first ruled their kingdoms and then embraced
initiation, continued in an orderly manner. ||377|| In that lineage, a powerful
son named Rakshasa was born to a Rakshasa named Manovega, and from his name, the
lineage came to be known as the Rakshasa lineage. ||378|| King Rakshasa had a
queen named Suprabha, and from her, he had two sons: Adityagati and Brihatkirti.
Both these sons possessed a radiance like that of the sun and the moon. ||379||
King Rakshasa, like a bull bearing the burden of the chariot of the kingdom,
entrusted his two sons with the responsibility of ruling and then, embracing
austerity, attained heaven. ||380|| The elder brother was Adityagati, the king,
and the younger brother was Brihatkirti, the crown prince. Adityagati's wife was
named Sadanpadma, and Brihatkirti's wife was known as Pushpanakha. ||381||
Adityagati had a son named Bhimaprbha, who had a thousand wives, all possessing
a radiance like that of celestial nymphs. ||382|| From these wives, he had one
hundred and eight powerful sons, who, like pillars, supported their kingdom from
all sides. ||383|| Subsequently, King Bhimaprbha, after bestowing his kingdom
upon his eldest son, embraced initiation and, through continuous austerity,
attained the supreme state. ||384|| Thus, numerous celestial beings of the
lineage of Meghavahana, upon whom the Rakshasa Indra, Bhima-Subhima, had
bestowed his grace, resided happily in the Rakshasadvipa. ||385|| These
Rakshasa-born celestial beings, protected by the merit of their deeds, guarded
the Rakshasadvipa, which became known as such. ||386||

## The Lineage of the Rakshasas  This is the origin of the Rakshasa lineage. I
will now describe the prominent men of this lineage.   Bhima Prabha's first son
was known as Pujarha. He renounced the world and gave the kingdom to his son,
Jitbhaaskar.   Jitbhaaskar, in turn, gave the kingdom to his son, Samparikīrti,
and became a monk. Samparikīrti then gave the kingdom to Sugrīva and received
initiation.   Sugrīva, placing Harigrīva on his throne, performed intense
austerities and became a great god.   Harigrīva, giving the kingdom to Śrīgrīva,
embraced the life of a monk and went into the forest.   Śrīgrīva, giving the
kingdom to Sumukha, followed the path chosen by his father. The powerful Sumukha
then gave the kingdom to Savyakta and received initiation.   Savyakta gave the
Rakshasa wealth to Amritvega, who then gave it to Bhanugati, and Bhanugati gave
it to Chintaagati, all of them embracing the path of a monk.   Thus, Indra,
Indra Prabha, Megha, Mrigari Daman, Pavi, Indrajit, Bhanuvarma, Bhanu, Bhanu
Prabha, Surari, Trijata, Bhima, Mohan, Uddharaka, Ravi, Chakara, Vajramadhya,
Pramoda, Singha Vikrama, Chamund, Marana, Mishma, Dwipavaha, Ari Mardana,
Nirvanabhakti, Ugrashri, Arhad Bhakti, Anuttar, Gatabhram, Anil, Chanda,
Lankashoka, Mayuravan, Mahabahu, Manorama, Bhaskarabha, Brihadgati, Brihatkanta,
Arisantraas, Chandraavarta, Maharava, Meghadhvana, Grihakshobha, and Nakshatra
Daman, and countless other Vidyaadharas, were born in this lineage. All these
Vidyaadharas were endowed with magic and prowess, and possessed knowledge,
strength, and great brilliance.   All of them were skilled in the application of
knowledge, their chests adorned with Lakshmi, beautiful, and mostly born in
Lanka after falling from heaven.   These Rakshasa kings, fearing the world, gave
the wealth inherited from their lineage to their sons and embraced the life of a
monk.   Some, due to the residue of their karma, went to the peak of the three
worlds. Others, due to the ripening of their good deeds, ascended to heaven.

## The Padma Purana  **Chapter 5: The Lineage of the Rakshasas**  **Verse 403:**
Thus, many kings passed by. Among them, a king named Dhanaprabha ruled Lanka.
His son, Kirtidhavala, renowned and born from his wife Padma, was born.  **Verse
404:** He was born from the Padma Agama, ruled by the Kshecharas, and enjoyed
supreme sovereignty in Lanka, just as Indra enjoys it in heaven.  **Verse 405:**
Thus, by the power of their past tapas, men attain enjoyment in the human and
divine realms. Those adorned with excellent qualities and possessing bodies
adorned with various virtues, having burnt away the karmic stains, become
Siddhas.  **Verse 406:** Those whose minds are attached to evil deeds receive
great condemnation in this world and after death fall into hell, experiencing
various kinds of suffering. Knowing this, O noble beings!  Embrace the sun-like
path to destroy the darkness of sin.  **Conclusion:** Thus ends the fifth
chapter of the Padma Charita, composed by the Acharya Ravishena, known as the
Arsha, which describes the lineage of the Rakshasas.

## Sixth Chapter  The lineage of the Rakshonas and Bhogas has been narrated by
me to you. Now, O King, listen to the lineage of the Vanaras. ||1||  In the
southern range of the Vijaya mountain, resembling heaven, there is a city named
Meghapur, adorned with lofty palaces. ||2||  In that city, there lived a
renowned king of the Vidyadharas named Ateeindra, who, by his wealth and
possessions, surpassed even Indra. ||3||  His wife, named Shrimati, was
beautiful and graceful, her face always radiant like the moon. ||4||  They had a
son named Shreekant, well-versed in scriptures. The wise rejoiced at the mere
mention of his name. ||5||  He had a younger sister, beautiful and named Devi.
Her eyes were like the arrows of Kamadeva. ||6||  There was a beautiful city
named Ratnapura, where resided a powerful Vidyadhara king named Pushpottara.
||7||  He had a son named Padmottara, whose beauty captivated everyone, making
them forget everything else. ||8||  Pushpottara requested Shreekant for his
daughter Devi for his son Padmottara many times, but Shreekant, due to his
karma, did not give her to him. ||9||  Instead, he gave her to Kirtidhaval, the
king of Lanka, following the advice of his relatives, and performed her marriage
with great pomp and ceremony. ||10||  Pushpottara was enraged. He thought,
"There is no fault in our lineage, no poverty in me, no ugliness in my son, and
no enmity between us. Still, Shreekant did not give his sister to my son."

In the Padma Purana, Shrikantha, to pay homage to the idols, went to Mount
Sumeru in a beautiful, swift, wind-like chariot. ||13|| Returning from there, he
heard a beautiful song, a melody that stole the minds and ears, like the buzzing
of bees. ||14|| The song, mixed with the sweet sound of the veena, made his body
still, as if bound by a straight rope. ||15|| Then, looking around, he saw
Padmaabha, the daughter of Pushpottara, sitting in the courtyard of the music
house, with her guru. ||16|| Seeing her, Shrikantha's mind quickly sank into the
ocean of Padmaabha's beauty, unable to extricate itself. Just as one cannot
catch elephants, he could not steady his mind. ||17|| Shrikantha stood in the
sky near the maiden. Shrikantha, with his handsome body and broad shoulders, was
attracted by Padmaabha's captivating blue eyes. ||18|| Then, the mutual, sweet
gaze of the two, signified their acceptance of each other, their love for each
other. ||19|| Then, knowing her intentions, Shrikantha took Padmaabha, who was
standing in the middle of his arms, and flew away. At that time, Padmaabha's
touch made his eyes close slightly. ||20|| The people, shouting and crying,
informed King Pushpottara that Shrikantha had abducted his daughter. ||21||
Hearing this, Pushpottara became very angry. In his anger, he bit his lips and,
fully prepared, went after Shrikantha. ||22|| Shrikantha was going ahead, and
Pushpottara was running after him, making Shrikantha look beautiful in the
middle of the sky, like the moon behind a cloud. ||23|| Seeing Pushpottara, the
mighty, coming after him, Shrikantha, the expert in the science of politics,
quickly went towards Lanka. ||24|| There, he sought refuge with his brother-in-
law, Koti Dhaval. It is right, because those who practice the right conduct at
the right time, achieve success. ||25|| Knowing that he was the brother of his
wife, Koti Dhaval embraced him with great affection and welcomed him. ||26||

The Sixth Chapter  While the exchange of pleasantries between the two continued,
Pushpottar arrived with a massive army. ||27||  Kirti-Shukla then looked up at
the sky, which was filled with a multitude of Vidyadharas, radiating a brilliant
light. ||28||  The army, with its fearsome weapons like swords and spears, and
the thunderous roar, seemed to be shaking the very ground, as if it were being
displaced by the gathering of celestial beings. ||29||  Seeing the northern
direction filled with horses as swift as the wind, elephants like clouds,
magnificent flying chariots, and lions with their manes flowing, Kirti-Shukla,
with a mixture of laughter and anger, gave the order for battle to his
ministers. ||30-31||  Then, overwhelmed with shame for his own wrongdoings,
Srikantha, with a sense of urgency, spoke to Kirti-Shukla: ||32|| "Protect my
beloved while I defeat the enemy with your support." ||33||  Hearing this,
Kirti-Shukla, with a sense of righteousness, replied: "It is not appropriate for
you to say this, having found refuge in me, the one who dispels fear." ||34||
"If this wicked man does not seek peace through diplomacy, then you will surely
see him enter the jaws of Yama, guided by me." ||35||  Having reassured his
sister's husband, the king sent his most valiant and wise messengers to
Pushpottar. ||36||  These messengers, highly intelligent and skilled in eloquent
speech, approached Pushpottar and spoke to him in turn: ||37||  "Pushpottar,
Kirti-Shukla, with words placed on our lips with respect, says to you: ||38||
You are born of a noble lineage, a man of pure actions, renowned throughout the
world, and a master of the scriptures. ||39||  O great intellect, what is there
that we haven't already conveyed to your ears, that we should now bring to your
attention?" ||40||  "Srikantha too is born of a pure lineage, like the rays of
the moon, wealthy, humble, handsome, and endowed with all virtues." ||41||

In the Padma Purana, it is ordained that a union should be made between two
individuals who are equal in terms of their virtues, lineage, and the girl's
beauty. ||42|| There is no reason for the destruction of the armies of both
sides, as it is the nature of girls to serve their husbands. ||43|| While the
messenger was speaking thus, a messenger sent by Padma arrived and spoke to
Pushpottar. ||44|| She said, "O Lord, Padma prostrates before your feet and says
that she is unable to come to you herself due to shyness." ||45|| "Father, there
is no fault of Shrikant in this matter. I myself was motivated by the influence
of my past actions." ||46|| "For women born in noble families, this is the path.
It is my rule to renounce any other man." ||47|| Thus, informed by the
messenger, Pushpottar was filled with anxiety. He was bewildered and distressed,
wondering what to do. ||48|| He thought, "The most important virtue for a groom
is to be born in a pure lineage. Shrikant possesses this virtue, and he has also
sought refuge in a powerful faction." ||49|| "Although I have the power to
overcome his pride, what can be done when the girl herself desires him?" ||50||
Knowing Pushpottar's intentions, the messengers, filled with joy, returned with
the messenger and reported everything to King Kirti Dhaval as it was. ||51||
Pushpottar, who had shed the burden of anger due to his daughter's words, was
proud and a knower of the ultimate truth. He returned to his own place. ||52||
On the first day of the bright fortnight of Margashirsha, in an auspicious hour,
the wedding ceremony of the two took place according to the scriptures. ||53||
One day, Kirti Dhaval, motivated by great love, spoke to Shrikant with
certainty. ||54|| "You have many enemies on Mount Vijaya. How long can you
remain vigilant?" ||55|| "Therefore, stay here in this beautiful palace filled
with jewels, in a place of your choice, and act as you please." ||56|| "You will
never be abandoned by me. How can you leave, having broken the promise of my
love?" ||57||

The Sixth Chapter 101 Having said this to Shrikanth, Kotidhavala called his
minister, Anand, who was wise and had come from the lineage of his forefathers.
He said, "You have known the essence and non-essence of my cities for a long
time. Therefore, tell me which city is the most essential for Shrikanth." The
minister, with his heart filled with devotion, replied, his white beard swaying
like a fly whisk, as if he were fanning his lord. "O King, there is not a single
city in your kingdom that is not beautiful. However, let Shrikanth choose
whichever city he finds pleasing." "In the middle of this ocean, there are many
islands, some of which are as large as Kalpa trees, with trees that extend in
all directions." "These islands have mountains that are adorned with various
jewels, with high peaks, and are very bright. These are the places where the
gods play." "The demons Bhima, Atibhima, and all the other gods have given these
islands and mountains to your lineage, as we have heard from ancient tradition."
"In these islands, there are many beautiful cities, adorned with golden palaces,
filled with great jewels, and so bright that they eclipse the sun." "The names
of these cities are Sandhyakar, Manohlad, Suvel, Kanchan, Hari, Yodhan,
Jaladhidhvan, Hansadvip, Bharakshama, Ardhasvargotkat, Avarta, Vighat, Rodhan,
Amal, Kant, Sphutatat, Ratnadvip, Toyavali, Sar, Alanghan, Nabhobhanu, and
Kshema, and many other beautiful places. Even the gods cannot cause trouble in
these places." "These cities, which are filled with great merit and whose earth
is adorned with various jewels, are now under your control." "In the northwest
direction, there is a large island called Vanaradvip, which is three hundred
yojanas in extent. This island is famous in all three worlds, and it has
thousands of beautiful Avantaar islands." "This island, in some places, shines
with the red light of Pushparaga gems, and in other places, it is covered with
vegetation, like a green jewel."

In the Padma Purana,  72. The water is sometimes covered with green gems, making
it look like it's covered with lush paddy plants.  73. Sometimes, it appears as
if it's enveloped in darkness due to the brilliance of Indranila gems, and
sometimes, it seems to be adorned with the splendor of the Kamalakar due to the
radiance of Padma raga gems.  74. Where fragrant winds roam in the sky, birds,
carried away, don't realize they are falling.  75. In ponds where clusters of
lotuses bloom, their movement is recognized by their brilliance, which is like
that of Padma raga gems set amidst crystal.  76. The islands, where intoxicated
birds, filled with the taste of nectar-like wine, make melodious sounds, seem to
be engaged in conversation with nearby islands.  77. Where the darkness is
banished by the brilliance of medicinal plants, night finds no place, even in
the darkest fortnight.  78. Where trees are shaped like umbrellas, adorned with
fruits and flowers, their trunks are massive, and birds perched on them make
sweet sounds.  79. Where the earth, covered with paddy plants, naturally endowed
with vigor and radiance, is gently swayed by the soft breeze, appears to be
wearing a green garment.  80. Where blue lotuses, adorned with swarms of bees,
bloom in the ponds, they seem to be gazing with eyes adorned with the movement
of eyebrows.  81. Where regions are devoid of wind due to the vast groves of
reeds and ponds, their sounds, produced by the movement of the wind, are
pleasing to the ears.  82. In the middle of that monkey island, there is a huge
mountain called Kishku, adorned with a vast expanse of gems and gold.  83. Like
the Trikuta mountain, this Kishku mountain, with its long arms like peaks,
embraces the directions, which are like beautiful women, bestowing upon them
supreme beauty.  84. Hearing such words of joy from the Minister of Joy,
Shrikantha, filled with supreme joy, said to his brother-in-law, Kirti Dhaval,
"I accept what you say."  85. Then, on the auspicious first day of the month of
Chaitra, Shrikantha, along with his family, went to the monkey island.

The Sixth Chapter 103 Seeing the sea, which was like a blue gem, spread over the
earth, he was filled with wonder. The sea was trembling due to the movement of
huge crocodiles. ||86|| Then he reached the monkey island, which was like
another heaven. The sound of waterfalls was like a welcome address. ||87|| The
waterfalls were so large that their spray reached the sky. The island seemed to
be laughing with joy at the arrival of Shrikantha. ||88|| The island was adorned
with beautiful groups of various gems, which looked like tall arches. ||89||
Then Shrikantha descended on the island, which was full of wonders. He looked in
all directions with his blue lotus-like eyes. ||90|| The island was adorned with
date palms, gooseberry trees, neem trees, kitha trees, agarwood trees,
sandalwood trees, banyan trees, koha trees, kadamba trees, mango trees, achar
trees, banana trees, pomegranate trees, betel nut trees, kankol trees, clove
trees, and many other beautiful trees. ||91-92|| The trees were so beautiful
that they looked like gem-studded trees that had emerged from the earth. They
did not allow their gaze to wander away from themselves. ||93|| The trunks of
the trees were straight, and their branches were very thick. The dense foliage
above looked like umbrellas. The branches were bright and slightly drooping, and
they were adorned with clusters of flowers and sweet fruits. They seemed to have
attained the best lineage. ||94-95|| The trees were not very tall, nor were they
very short. They were just the right height for women to easily reach their
flowers, fruits, and leaves. ||96|| The creeper-like women, who were beautiful
with their cluster-like breasts, whose eyes were like bees, and whose hands were
like fluttering leaves, were embracing the trees with great affection. ||97||
The trees seemed to be talking to each other with the sweet sound of birds, and
they were adorned with the sweet humming of bees, as if they were singing.
||98|| Some trees were white like conch shells, some were yellow like gold, some
were pink like lotuses, and some were blue like lapis lazuli. ||99|| 1.

104. In that Padma Purana, the land was adorned with various kinds of trees, so
beautiful that even heaven would seem inferior. 10. The conversation of the male
and female chakora birds, as clear as human speech, with the mynas, was a wonder
in that land. 101. Then, seated on the jeweled and golden platforms, under the
shade of various trees, fragrant with flowers, Srikantha, along with his army,
enjoyed the pleasures of the body. 102-103. Then, amidst the garlands of various
flowers, the swans and sarasa birds singing, the clear water filled with fish,
the trees showering flowers, the majestic trees with their loud cries of
victory, and the beautiful land adorned with various jewels, Srikantha wandered
happily. 104-106. Then, wandering in that forest, resembling the Nandana forest,
Srikantha saw many monkeys playing at will. 107. Seeing this extraordinary
creation, he wondered, "These monkeys are born in the animal realm, yet why are
they so similar to humans?" 108. They have a face, hands, feet, and other limbs
like humans, and their actions are also similar to humans. 109. Then, a great
desire to play with them arose in Srikantha. Although he was a steady king, he
became very eager. 110. With a surprised mind, he said to the men standing
nearby, looking at his face, "Bring these monkeys here quickly." 111. As soon as
he said this, the Vidyadharas brought hundreds of monkeys and stood them near
him. All the monkeys were making joyful sounds. 112. The king, Srikantha, with
his good nature, began to play with those monkeys. Sometimes he would dance them
by clapping his hands, sometimes he would touch them with his arms, and
sometimes... 1. Chakora yugalam. 2. Mahatvisham. 3. -Mivoddatam. 4.

The Sixth Chapter 109 He saw their white teeth, red like pomegranate blossoms,
in their mouths, which were adorned with shining golden earrings. || 114 || He
saw the monkeys removing lice from each other with courtesy, and engaging in a
delightful playful quarrel with love, making a sound of laughter. || 115 ||
Their hair, like the husk of rice, was soft, very delicate, and moved gently in
the soft breeze, adorned with a parting. || 116 || Their ears, shaped like the
ears of a jester, were extremely soft and smooth, and their bodies were
motionless. || 117 || He straightened the disordered hairs on their bellies,
which were as large as a fist, and raised their eyebrows and the lines on their
faces. || 118 || Then he entrusted many of them to the servants, to be nourished
with sweet food and drink, for the sake of pleasure. || 119 || Having taken
them, he, whose mind was filled with the sight of the young ones, ascended Mount
Kishku, with its peaks, vines, waterfalls, and trees. || 120 || There he saw a
vast, level land, protected by great mountains on the outskirts, adorned with
tall trees. || 121 || In that land, he established a city known as Kishkupura,
which was inaccessible even to the mind, let alone the bodies of enemies. || 122
|| This city was fourteen yojanas long and wide, and its circumference was
forty-two yojanas, a little more. || 123 || The Vidhyadharas had built
magnificent palaces with high entrances, walls made of jewels and gold, adorned
with beautiful balconies, and supported by pillars of jewels. || 124 || The part
near the pigeon-houses was made of large lapis lazuli gems, and it seemed as if
the darkness had been driven away by the brilliance of the jewels, as if it had
been given a place there out of compassion. || 125 || The doorways of the
palaces were made of ruby gems, which made them appear red, as if they were
wearing lips whose redness had been enhanced by chewing betel. Above the doors
were hung garlands of many pearls.

In the Padma Purana, it is said that the Dehli Pindaka was made of Panarag, and
it was adorned with a Tambula-like shade, like a Radachhada.  The doors were
adorned with a string of pearls, and the beauty of the buildings was such that
it seemed to mock the beauty of other buildings. The peaks were adorned with
jewels that resembled the moon, and they caused doubt in the minds of people at
night, as to which was the real moon. The buildings were illuminated by the
light of Chandrakanta gems, and the ornate doorways were adorned with various
jewels, which made them seem like they were made of gold. The floors of the
buildings were made of jewels, and the ceilings were adorned with paintings of
lotus flowers. The roads were made of jewels and gold, and they were as wide as
a dry ocean. The city was surrounded by a wall made of jewels, and the towers
were so high that they seemed to touch the heavens. The gates were adorned with
jewels, and they were so high that they seemed to touch the clouds. The city was
so beautiful that it was like the city of Indra. The king, Shrikant, lived in
this city with his beloved Padmaabha, and they enjoyed themselves like Indra and
Indrani. There was nothing in the Bhadrasala forest, the Saumanasa forest, or
the Nandana forest that was not available to him. One day, Shrikant was sitting
on the roof of his palace when he saw Indra going to the Nandishvara island to
worship. Indra was adorned with a crown that made the sky look yellow, and he
was playing music that made everyone deaf. He was riding on an elephant, a
horse, a swan, a ram, a camel, a wolf, and a deer, and he was surrounded by a
divine fragrance. Shrikant had heard about the Nandishvara island from the
sages, and he remembered that it was a place of joy for the gods. He decided to
go to the Nandishvara island with the gods, and he boarded a chariot that was
made of jewels and had a bird made of jewels on it. He was stopped by a mountain
that was made of jewels, and he was unable to proceed.

## Sixth Chapter ### 107  Seeing the celestial beings crossing the Manushottara
mountain, Srikantha was filled with immense sorrow.  He lamented, "Alas, what a
pity! The progress of humans with their limited powers is deplorable!"  He had a
vision of worshipping the magnificent images of the Jinas in Nandishvara, with
pure devotion, offering them various flowers, incense, and garlands, and bowing
down with his head touching the ground.  He wondered, "How could my beautiful
aspirations, made with such a simple heart, be shattered by the evil karmas
accumulated in my past lives?"  He had heard many times that humans cannot cross
the Manushottara mountain, but his faith, which had grown immensely, had made
him forget this.  He was eager to go, despite his limited powers.  Therefore, he
decided to perform actions that would ensure his journey to Nandishvara in his
next life, without any obstacles.  With this firm resolve, he entrusted his
kingdom to his son and became a great sage, renouncing all possessions.  ###
152-155  His son, Vajrakantha, was enjoying the exquisite wealth of Kishkupura
with his beloved Charunya, when he heard the story of his father's past life
from the elders.  This ignited his dispassion, and he renounced his kingdom and
embraced Jain initiation.  King Shrenik, hearing this, asked Gautam Ganadhar
about the story of Srikantha's past life, which had made Vajrakantha renounce
the world.  Ganadhar replied, "In their previous life, there were two brothers
who were merchants.  They were very close, but their wives separated them.  The
younger brother was poor, while the elder was wealthy.  The elder brother was
obedient to a wealthy merchant, and through his association, he attained the
status of a Shravaka.  However, the younger brother was addicted to hunting and
other vices.  The elder brother was always saddened by his younger brother's
condition."

In the Padma Purana, 'When the Alokasvahat Swami Purusha was released, after
testing his brother's affection, he gave him great wealth. || 156 || Then,
abandoning his wicked wife, he took initiation after instructing his younger
brother. The elder brother became Indra, while the younger brother died in
peace. || 157 || The younger brother's soul, having fallen from heaven, became
Shrikant. To guide him, the elder brother's soul, who had become the glorious
Indra, went to Nandishwar Dweep, revealing himself. || 158 || Seeing Indra, your
father Shrikant regained his memory of his past life. The elders told this story
to Vajrakant. || 159 || Hearing this story, Vajrakant became a muni, giving his
kingdom to his son Vajra Prabha. Vajra Prabha also became a muni, giving his
kingdom to his son Indramat. || 160 || Then, Indramat had a son named Meru, Meru
had a son named Mandar, Mandar had a son named Samiranagati, Samiranagati had a
son named Raviprabha, and Raviprabha had a son named Amaraprabha. Amaraprabha
brought Gunavati, the daughter of the king of Lanka, to his city for marriage.
|| 161 - 162 || The ground where the wedding altar was built was as clear as a
mirror. The wives of the Vidyadharas had created many wondrous paintings with
jewels. In one place, there was a forest of lotuses embraced by bees, in
another, a forest of blue lotuses, in another, a forest of half red and half
blue lotuses, in another, pairs of swans with lotus stalks in their beaks, and
in another, pairs of cranes, sarasa birds, and other birds. The Vidyadharas had
also created images of monkeys with very smooth, five-colored, jeweled powder.
Seeing these, the king of the Vidyadharas, Amaraprabha, was filled with great
joy. It is right, for beautiful forms often captivate the hearts of even brave
and noble men. || 163 - 167 || While King Amaraprabha was overjoyed, the bride
Gunavati was terrified at the sight of the monkeys with their distorted faces.
Her whole body trembled, and all her ornaments shook. || 168 ||

The Sixth Chapter  109. Her eyes, filled with fear, wandered about, unable to
focus on anything. Her body trembled, as if she were showing the fear of a
mortal. 169. The tilak on her forehead, smeared by drops of sweat, spread out.
Though she was afraid, her actions were still graceful. Finally, she was so
terrified that she clung to King Amaraprabha. 170. King Amaraprabha, who had
been delighted by the monkeys earlier, was now filled with anger towards them.
This is understandable, because even a beautiful object becomes distasteful when
one sees the intention behind it. 171. Then he said, "Who painted these monkeys,
with their various forms and fear-inducing appearances, for our wedding?" 172.
"Surely, there is someone who envies me and is behind this. I will find him
quickly and kill him myself." 173. Seeing the king consumed by anger, the wise
old ministers spoke to him in soothing words. 174. "My lord, there is no one who
hates you. How could anyone who hates you possibly live?" 175. "Be happy, and
listen to the reason why the rows of monkeys were painted for the wedding
celebration." 176. "In your lineage, there was a famous king named Shrikhantha,
who created this beautiful city of Kishkupura, which is like heaven." 177. "Just
as the root cause of actions is the cycle of desires and attachments, so too,
this country, with its diverse forms, was created by King Shrikhantha." 178.
"Even today, the Kinnaras, dwelling in the groves of the forests, sing the
praises of that king, having attained the highest position." 179. "That king,
with his steady nature and strength like Indra, removed the disgrace brought
upon Lakshmi by her fickleness." 180. "It is said that he was amazed when he
first saw these monkeys in this city, with their beautiful forms and human-like
appearances." 181. "He played joyfully with these monkeys, who had various ways
of behaving, and he made them comfortable by providing them with delicious food
and drink." 182.

##  English Translation:  110 In the Padma Purana, it is said that from that
time onwards, all those who were born in the lineage of that great one, the best
of men, developed devotion and love for those monkeys. ||183||  Since your
ancestors had established these monkeys as auspicious objects, they are now
present in this auspicious event. ||184|| In any lineage where a particular
object is worshipped as auspicious by the ancestors, if it is disregarded, then
obstacles and hindrances arise. ||185|| However, if the same action is performed
with devotion, it brings good fortune. Therefore, O King, you, who are wise and
have a noble heart, should also worship these monkeys. ||186|| Upon hearing this
from his ministers, Amaraprabha, the king, replied with great comfort. He
discarded the anger that had arisen on his face while speaking. ||187|| He said,
"If our ancestors worshipped these monkeys as auspicious, then why are they
depicted on the earth where the feet and other parts of the body are placed?"
||188|| Out of respect for the elders, I will bow to them and wear them on my
head. Make their images with jewels and other materials and place them on the
crowns, flags, peaks of palaces, arches, and on the tops of umbrellas. Do this
quickly." ||189|| The ministers, upon receiving this order, said "So be it" and
carried out everything according to the king's wishes. Wherever you looked,
there were monkeys everywhere. ||190-191|| Then, after enjoying great happiness
with his queen, the desire to conquer Vijayaditya mountain arose in the heart of
King Amaraprabha. So, he set out with his four-armed army. At that time, his
flags bore the mark of the monkeys, and all the monkey-descendants praised him.
||192-193|| In the battle, which was a crushing defeat for the enemies, he
conquered both armies, but he did not take their wealth. ||194|| This is right,
because it is the vow of proud men to subdue their enemies, not to desire their
wealth. ||195|| Then, King Amaraprabha, accompanied by the leading men of
Vijayaditya mountain, returned to Kishku city after conquering the world.

The Sixth Chapter  111. Having attained the sovereignty of all the Vidyadharas,
he enjoyed Lakshmi for a long time. Lakshmi was fickle, so he bound her with
chains as if to make her steady. ||197||  Then a son was born to him named
Kapiket. His queen was Sri-Prabha, who was the embodiment of virtues. ||198||
Seeing his son's prowess, Amaraprabha entrusted him with the kingdom and left
the confines of his home. ||199||  Kapiket also left home, giving the kingdom to
his son, Pratibala. This is quite common, as the former kings often saw the
kingdom as a poisonous vine. ||200||  Those who have earned merit in their
previous lives do not have a great attachment to the kingdom gained through
their efforts. ||201||  Since virtuous men obtain Lakshmi effortlessly with
little effort, they do not suffer when they abandon it. ||202||  Even if
virtuous men somehow enjoy worldly pleasures, they soon become detached from
them and desire the supreme state of liberation. ||203||  That happiness which
is not achieved through means, but is dependent on the soul, is continuous,
great, and without end - who would not desire such happiness? ||204||  Pratibala
had a son named Gagan-ananda. Gagan-ananda had a son named Kshechar-ananda, and
Kshechar-ananda had a son named Giri-nanda. ||205||  Thus, in the lineage of the
Vanara-ketus, there were countless kings. Some of them attained heaven according
to their karma, while others attained liberation. ||206||  Gautama Swami said to
King Srenika, "O King! This is merely a description of the shadow of those born
in the lineage. Who is capable of mentioning the names of all these men?"
||207||  In the world, one is known by one's characteristics. For example, a
servant is known for his service, a farmer for his farming, an archer for his
archery, a righteous person for his righteousness, a warrior for his protection
of the suffering, and a Brahmin for his celibacy. ||208||  Just as those born in
the Ikshvaku lineage are called Ikshvaku, and those born in the Nami-Vinamika
lineage are called Vidyadharas because they possess knowledge, so too... ||209||

---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, A king who abandons his kingdom and becomes a Shraman is
considered great. He attains connection with tapasya, which is called shram.
||211|| This word is clearly distinct and has other uses. Just as one who holds
a staff is called a "yashti" and one who holds a spear is called a "kunta,"
similarly, those who sit on a platform are called "mancha." ||212|| In the same
way, those who have the mark of a monkey on their umbrellas and other things are
known as "vanara" in the world. ||214|| The great Shreyansnath and Vasupujya, in
their time, had the mark of a monkey on their crowns, and those who came after
them in their lineage also followed this tradition. Indeed, following the
practices of one's ancestors brings great joy. ||215-216|| Thus, the origin of
the monkey lineage has been briefly explained. Now, I will tell you another
story. ||217|| In the excellent city of Kishkun, there was a king of the vanara
lineage named Mahodadhi. His wife was named Vidyutprakasha, who was a treasure
trove of feminine qualities. She captivated her husband's heart with her
actions. She was the crown jewel of hundreds of beautiful women, due to her good
fortune, beauty, knowledge, and other actions. ||218-220|| This king, Mahodadhi,
had one hundred and eight valiant sons. He entrusted the burden of the kingdom
to them and enjoyed his pleasures. ||221|| In the tirtha of Muni Suvratnath,
Mahodadhi was a famous vidyadhara. He always kept the vidyadharas captivated
with his wondrous deeds. ||222|| At that time, in Lanka, there was a famous king
named Vidyutkesha, who was like the moon in the sky of the Rakshasa lineage and
was very dear to the people. ||223|| Mahodadhi and Vidyutkesha had great
affection for each other, which grew due to their frequent visits to each
other's places. Their minds were one, only their bodies were separate. ||224||
Knowing the greatness of Shramanhood, Vidyutkesha, who was like the sound of the
ocean, embraced Shramanhood and became a master of the ultimate truth. ||225||

## Sixth Chapter  **113**  The श्रेणिक asked the गणनायक, "Why did Tadditkesha
take such a difficult vow?"   **226** The गणनायक replied, "Once, Tadditkesha
went to play in the beautiful forest called Pramda, which had many places for
recreation."  **227** "He would play in the lovely lakes filled with clear
water, adorned with lotuses and blue lotuses, where large waves rose and boats
moved gracefully."  **228** "He would swing on the magnificent swings, with
comfortable seats, tied to tall trees, that soared high."  **229** "He would
climb the golden mountains, with steps leading to their peaks, adorned with
jewels, and surrounded by groves of trees."  **230** "He would play among the
groves of trees, beautiful with fruits and flowers, adorned with swaying leaves,
and embraced by vines."  **231** "He would play among women whose graceful
movements and playful gestures could even disturb the minds of the munis. Their
hands, like blooming buds, were busy plucking flowers. Their bodies, bearing
heavy hips, were marked with drops of sweat. Their large pearl necklaces bounced
with the movement of their breasts, adding to their beauty. Their waists,
adorned with delicate lines, sometimes disappeared and sometimes reappeared.
Their minds were distracted, trying to shoo away the intoxicated bees attracted
by their breath. They held their loose garments with their hands, and their eyes
darted about."  **232-235** "Thus, the king of the Rakshasas, Tadditkesha, was
enjoying himself among many women."  **236** "Then, while Tadditkesha's queen,
Shrichandra, was engrossed in play, a monkey came and tore her breasts with his
sharp claws."  **237** "The monkey, naturally disrespectful, was filled with
extreme remorse and his eyes were distorted with anger."  **238** "Tadditkesha,
seeing his beloved bleeding, comforted her and then, drawing his bow, killed the
monkey."  **225**  Upon hearing this news, the महाओदधि, a seeker of the ultimate
truth, took the muni-diksha.

114 Padma Purana !  He quickly went there and fell to the ground. Where the
sages, the aerial beings, reside. ||239|| Seeing the monkey trembling and
wounded, the sages, who knew the state of the world, felt compassion. ||240||
They taught him the five prostrations, along with the renunciation of all
possessions, and the wealth of austerities, which are accompanied by righteous
giving. ||241|| Then, abandoning his deformed monkey form, he became the
Mahoudadhi Kumar, a celestial being with a magnificent form, in an instant.
||242|| Then, as the celestial being was about to kill the other monkeys, the
Mahoudadhi Kumar, knowing his past life, arrived there. He worshipped his former
body. ||243|| Seeing the group of monkeys being killed by cruel men, he, with
the power of his karma, created a great army of monkeys. ||244|| Their mouths
were terrible with sharp fangs, their brows were furrowed, their color was like
red ochre, and they made fearsome sounds. ||245|| Some were lifting mountains in
their hands, some were uprooting trees, some were pounding the earth with their
hands, and others were shaking the earth. ||246|| Their bodies were filled with
the weight of anger, making them appear like the great Rudra, and they were
leaping far and wide. These magical monkeys, filled with rage, spoke to the
monkey king, the celestial being, Vidhyutkesh, who was filled with delusion.
||247|| "Stop, stop, you wicked one! You are now in the grip of death. O sinner!
Having killed the monkey, where will you go for refuge now?" ||248|| Saying
this, they filled the entire sky with their hands, which held mountains, so much
so that even a needle could not be seen. ||249|| Then, filled with wonder,
Vidhyutkesh thought, "This is not the power of the monkeys, it must be something
else." ||250|| Then, abandoning hope for his body, Vidhyutkesh, the wise in the
science of ethics, spoke to the monkeys with sweet words and humility. ||251||
"O virtuous ones! Tell me, who are you? Your bodies are shining brightly. This
power of yours does not seem to be the natural power of monkeys." ||252||

## Sixth Chapter  115. Seeing the celestial leader adorned with humility, the
great ocean prince spoke these words:  253. You, being of the nature of the
animal species, are extremely fickle. The monkey who was killed by you for
offending his wife, was I.  254. By the grace of the virtuous, I have attained
this divine state, endowed with great power and possessing all desired wealth.
255. Seeing my glory, you should know this, and saying so, he revealed his
supreme fortune to him.  256. Then, overcome with fear, he trembled throughout
his body. His heart was shattered, his hair stood on end, and his eyes rolled.
257. The great ocean prince said to him, "Do not be afraid."  Distressed, he
spoke in a choked voice, "What should I do?"  258. Then, that celestial being
took him to the venerable one who had given him the five prostrations mantra.
After circumambulating him, they both prostrated at his feet.  259. The monkey,
by virtue of his good deeds, has attained this divine state. By attaining you,
the compassionate one, as my guru, I have attained this divine state.  260.
Addressing him as "Devendra," he praised him again and again. He was also
worshipped with great offerings and prostrated at his feet.  261. Seeing this
wonder, the celestial being, the repository of austerities, asked, "What should
I do?" He spoke words of benefit.  262. "My guru, who is endowed with the four
knowledges, is near here. Let us go to him, for this is the eternal Dharma."
263. "He who, while dwelling near the Acharya, does not go to him and instead
acts as the Acharya himself, is a foolish disciple who abandons discipleship
from afar.  264. He is neither a disciple nor an Acharya, he is devoid of
Dharma, he is a follower of the wrong path, he is corrupted in all his conduct,
and he is condemned by the virtuous."  265. Hearing this, the celestial being
and the Vidyadhara were filled with wonder. They both, along with their
families, thought this.

## Chapter 116  **116**  Oh, the supreme greatness of the Papuraana, surpassing
even the merit of austerities! Even for a sage like this, there exists another
Guru. ||267||  Then, in the outskirts of his hermitage, there were those who
were guided by the virtuous, and also gods and celestial beings, whose minds
were filled with a longing for Dharma. ||268||  Going there, they
circumambulated the sage with reverence and prostrated themselves before him.
They did not stand too far away, nor too close. ||269||  Then, seeing the
supreme form of the sage, blazing with the brilliance born of his austerities,
the gods and celestial beings were filled with a certain anxiety arising from
their devotion to Dharma. Their lotus-like eyes were filled with joy and wonder,
and they were all imbued with great humility. ||270-271||  Then, the gods and
celestial beings, with folded hands, asked the sage about Dharma and its
appropriate fruits. ||272||  Then, the sage, whose mind was always engaged in
the welfare of beings, and whose actions were always far removed from the causes
of worldly existence, spoke in a voice as deep as the roar of a rain-laden
cloud, explaining the supreme Dharma that brings about the welfare of the world.
||273-274||  As he spoke, the groups of peacocks, dwelling in the arbors, danced
in joy, their cries echoing like thunder. ||275||  The sage said, "O gods and
celestial beings! Listen attentively, with your minds fixed on Dharma, as I
explain its nature as revealed by the Jinas, the bringers of joy to the world."
||276||  "Many lowly beings, whose minds are dull and incapable of reflection,
in the name of Dharma, actually indulge in Adharma." ||277||  "A deluded person,
who, without knowing the direction, thinks, 'This is the way,' and goes in the
opposite direction, will not reach his desired destination, even after a long
time." ||278||  "Those who are attached to worldly pleasures, with minds devoid
of reflection, indulge in Adharma, which is called Dharma in stories and myths,
born of acts like killing beings." ||279||  "Those who, with such intentions,
indulge in Adharma, contaminated by false beliefs, become destined for the
suffering of the animal and hell realms." ||280||  "Deluded by the meaning of
scriptures filled with a web of false arguments and the punishments of their
gurus, they strike their foreheads in the hope of attaining Dharma." ||281||
**Commentary:**  This passage highlights the importance of true Dharma and the
dangers of false beliefs and actions. It emphasizes the need for reflection,
understanding, and guidance from a true Guru. The passage also describes the joy
and wonder that arises from witnessing the supreme form of a sage who has
attained liberation through austerities.

## Sixth Chapter  117. Even if there is a little bit of Dharma in some false
teachings, which are devoid of violence and other sins, and which preach bodily
labor, it is still rootless because of the absence of Right Faith. Such beings
have a small, ignorant character, which is not a means of liberation.  282-283.
A lump of clay is also earthly, and a Vaidurya gem is also earthly. But, due to
the commonality of being earthly, their qualities are not equal.  284. Dharma as
described by the wrong-sighted is like a lump of clay, while Dharma as described
by the Jina is like a Vaidurya gem, even though the name "Dharma" is the same
for both.  285. The root of Dharma is compassion, and the root of compassion is
non-violence. For those who are attached to possessions, violence is constantly
arising.  286. Besides compassion, truthful speech is also Dharma, but truthful
speech is that which does not cause suffering to others.  287. Renunciation of
taking what is not given, avoidance of another's wife, contentment in acquiring
wealth, restraint of the senses, thinning of the passions, and humility of the
wise, are the vows of the Right-Faithful householders. Listen to the Dharma of
those who are without homes.  288-289. Those who ride on the elevated back of
the elephant of the five great vows, whose bodies are covered with the strong,
impenetrable armor of the three guptas, who are accompanied by the five groups
of foot soldiers, and who are equipped with a multitude of sharp weapons of
various austerities, are the great kings, the Digambaras, who are surrounded by
ministers of passions and ride on the elephant of delusion, and who destroy the
enemy of the world.  290-292. When all beginnings are renounced and Right Faith
is embraced, then the Dharma of the monks is attained. This is the essence of
Dharma.  293. This Dharma is the cause of attaining the wealth of the three
worlds. The best of men have declared this Dharma to be the supreme
auspiciousness.  294. What other quality of Dharma can be spoken of that is
greater than this, by which the peak of the three worlds is attained, along with
great happiness?  295. Beings, desiring to attain Dharma, strike the sky with
great punishments, meaning they consider actions that have no trace of Dharma to
be Dharma.

##  English Translation:  **118**  **296.** In the Padma Purana, it is said that
a person enjoys great merits in heaven by the virtue of the householder's path.
These merits are accumulated by the mind, while residing amidst the group of
deities.  **297.** However, through the path of renunciation (Jain monasticism),
a human being attains liberation, which is unparalleled, free from suffering,
and eternal bliss.  **298.** Those who are excellent beings, even after falling
from heaven, attain the path of Jain monasticism and achieve the supreme state
(liberation) within two or three lifetimes.  **299.** Even though those who are
sinful and have wrong views may attain heaven by chance, they fall from there
and wander in lower births.  **300.** The teachings of the Jinas are the best
words, the austerities prescribed by them are the best, the religion they preach
is the supreme religion, and the philosophy they teach is the ultimate
philosophy.  **301.** Just as a person going to a city finds the confluence of
tree roots, etc., effortlessly, similarly, a person who sets out on the path of
liberation guided by the teachings of the Jinas, effortlessly obtains the
blessings of deities, celestial beings, etc.  **302.** It is not surprising that
the Jain religion is the cause of the enjoyments of Indra and others, because
even ordinary merit can lead to such enjoyments.  **304.** Any conduct or
knowledge that is contrary to the householder's path and the path of
renunciation is called "adharma" (unrighteousness).  **305.** Due to this
unrighteousness, a being wanders in various hellish realms, where it experiences
various kinds of suffering caused by vehicles, beatings, cutting, piercing, and
exposure to cold and heat.  **306.** Due to this unrighteousness, a being
wanders in numerous hells filled with perpetual darkness. Some of these hells
are characterized by constant shivering due to icy winds, while others are
engulfed in flames of fire that appear terrifying due to sparks.  **307.** Some
hells are filled with various kinds of machines that make loud noises, while
others are filled with lions, tigers, wolves, jackals, and vultures created by
karma.  **308.** Some hells are filled with trees that rain down discs, axes,
spears, swords, etc.  **295.** What other excellent quality can be attributed to
a religion that leads to liberation (moksha)? This is the supreme quality of
religion: it leads to liberation.  **296-297.** Through the householder's path,
a human being resides amidst a group of deities in heaven and enjoys the best of
pleasures simply by willing them. However, through the path of renunciation, he
attains liberation, which is unparalleled, free from suffering, and eternal
bliss.  **298.** Excellent beings who fall from heaven, upon taking the path of
Jain monasticism, attain the supreme state (liberation) within two or three
lifetimes.  **299.** However, sinful beings with wrong views, even if they
attain heaven by chance, fall from there and wander in lower births.  **300.**
The teachings of the Jinas are the best words, the austerities prescribed by
them are the best, the religion they preach is the supreme religion, and the

The Sixth Chapter 119 Some are given molten lead, tin, etc. to drink. Some are
tormented by sharp-beaked flies, etc. Some are filled with worms and blood-
soaked mud. Some are tormented by each other.  ||309-310|| In such ways, the
suffering that living beings experience in hell is impossible to describe.
||311|| Just as you both wandered through many painful births in the past, so
too will you wander again if you remain devoid of Dharma. ||312|| Thus
questioned by the Dev and the Vidyadhara, the supreme Shraman said, "Tell me,
how did you both wander through these miserable births?" ||313|| Then, adorned
with the ornament of restraint, the Shraman spoke these sweet words, "My dear
ones, calm your minds." ||314|| You both wandered in this world of suffering,
driven by delusion, killing each other. ||315|| You both attained human birth
through karma, but it is very difficult to find Dharma in this world. ||316||
One of you became a minister named Suyashodata in the city of Sravasti in the
land of Kashi. Suyashodata was very handsome, and he took initiation and
wandered the earth, engaged in great austerities. ||317|| While wandering,
Suyashodata Muni arrived in Kashi and sat in a secluded place. Many women of the
right faith came to worship him. Seeing the Muni surrounded by women, the wicked
hunter, wielding weapons of sharp words, began to frighten him. ||318-320||
"This shameless, naked, and unbathed man, covered in filth, is a great
misfortune for me, who is out hunting." ||321|| As the hunter, wielding a
fearsome bow, spoke these words, the Muni's meditation became clouded with
sorrow. ||322|| Thinking, "I will crush this sinful hunter to dust with a single
blow of my fist," he became filled with anger. ||323||

## English Translation:  120 The merit that Kapishtha had earned, which would
have enabled him to attain heaven, was lost in a moment due to his anger. ||32||
After that, he became a Jyotish-deva (celestial being associated with light) due
to some equanimity. From there, you became a Vidyutkesha (lightning-haired)
Vidyadhara. ||325|| And the Vyadha (hunter) wandered for a long time in the
forest of Samsara (cycle of birth and death) and became a monkey in the pleasure
garden of Lanka. ||326|| Due to his fickleness, he killed him with an arrow for
a woman. Finally, he attained the Panchanamaskaara mantra and became a deva
named Mahodadhi. ||327||  Knowing this, O Deva Vidyadharas! Abandon your mutual
enmity so that you may not have to wander in Samsara again. ||328|| O Bhadra-
purushas (noble beings)! You are devoted to Bhadra-achara (noble conduct),
therefore aspire for the happiness of the Siddhas (perfected beings), which
cannot be praised by any human. ||329||  Salute Munisuvrata Bhagavan, who is
worshipped by Indra and other Devas, with utmost devotion. ||330||  Having
attained refuge in him, who has completed his own welfare and is engaged in the
welfare of others, you will attain supreme happiness. ||331||  Then,
Vidyutkesha, like a lotus, was awakened by the rays of the sun, which emerged
from the mouth of the Muni (sage). ||332||  He, the valiant, transferred his
position to his son, Sukesha, and became a disciple of the Muni, who is adorned
with the fourfold virtues. ||333||  Then, he worshipped the three jewels -
Samyagdarshan (right faith), Samyagjnana (right knowledge), and Samyakcharitra
(right conduct) - and became a supreme deva due to the power of Samadhi
(meditation). ||334|| Meanwhile, Mahodadhi, the lord of Kishkupura, was sitting
on the peak of a magnificent palace, adorned with beautiful women who shone like
lightning, and bathed in the rays of the moon, enjoying the nectar of a
beautiful gathering, like Indra. ||335-336||  At that time, a Vidyadhara,
wearing white clothes, arrived with great speed, stood before him, and
respectfully bowed. Then, he informed Vidyutkesha about his desire to take
Diksha (initiation). Hearing this, Mahodadhi, being detached from worldly
pleasures, decided to take Diksha. ||337-338||  1. क्षणाद्भस्ममुपागतम् म० । 2.

When he said, "I am taking the vows," a great wail arose from the inner palace.
The echo of that lament reverberated throughout the entire palace. ||339|| The
lament of the women, a mixture of the sounds of the veena, flute, and mridanga,
was so powerful that it even moved the mind of the muni, causing him to be
filled with compassion. ||340|| At that time, the Yuvaraja also arrived there.
With tears that could not be contained flowing in torrents, he said
respectfully, "Vidutkesa, your son, Sukesa, has been entrusted to you out of
great love. He has ascended the new throne and is now worthy of your
protection." ||341-342|| The wise ministers, whose hearts were filled with
sorrow, also encouraged him by citing many examples from the scriptures, saying,
"Enjoy this magnificent, unhindered kingdom like Indra, and make your youth
successful with excellent pleasures." ||343-344|| The women, whose heads were
bowed at his feet, who were expressing their intense love through their virtues,
and whose eyes were streaming with tears, tried to please him by saying, "O
Lord! You are leaving us all as orphans, like a tree leaving its vines behind.
Where are you going?" ||345-346|| "O Lord! This beautiful kingdom, like a
devoted wife, has been bound to you for a long time by your excellent virtues.
Where are you going, leaving her behind?" The Samantas, whose cheeks were wet
with tears, also pleaded together, but even all of them together could not
change his mind. ||347-348|| Finally, he severed the bonds of affection,
renounced all possessions, and entrusted the kingdom to his son, Pratichandra.
He then embraced the difficult Daigambari Lakshmi, the monastic vows, with a
detached mind. He was a man of great intellect, extremely serious, and his
gentleness made him seem like the moon, eternally fixed on the surface of the
earth. ||349-350|| Then, mounted on the elephant of meditation, the Muni
Maharaj, with the sharp arrow of the ocean of knowledge, severed the head of the
enemy, the world, and entered the Siddhavana, the realm of liberation. ||351||
After that, Pratichandra also gave the kingdom to his elder son, Kishkindha, and
the Yuvaraja position to his younger son, Andhrakarudi. ||352||

In the Padma Purana,  One day, having taken the Jain path, he became steadfast.
He went to the place frequented by the Siddhas, pure in his yoga. ||353|| Then,
both brothers, eager to perform their duty, roamed the earth. They were both
radiant, like the sun and the moon, their brilliance clashing. ||354||
Meanwhile, in the southern part of the mountain range, in the sky, there was a
city named Rathanupura, resembling a city of the gods. ||355|| There, the lord
of both the clans was a mighty warrior, named Asanivega, who instilled fear in
his enemies. ||356|| His son was Vijayasimha. He desired to marry the daughter
of the king of Aditya-pura, named Srimalā, who was born to the Vidya-dhara king
Vidya-mandara and his queen Vegavati. She was so beautiful that she eclipsed the
sky with her radiance. Seeing his daughter in her youth, Vidya-mandara, with the
consent of his relatives, arranged a Swayamvara. Vijayasimha, the son of
Asanivega, desired Srimalā, and thus, driven by his love for her beauty, he went
to the Swayamvara. ||357-359|| All the other celestial beings, adorned with
their bodies, filled the sky with their jeweled chariots, quickly arriving to
pay their respects. ||360|| Then, on beautiful platforms, supported by pillars
of jewels, adorned with lofty seats, and radiating with the brilliance of
embedded gems, the chief celestial beings sat in their respective places. They
were accompanied by a limited retinue, useful for their bodily needs.
||361-362|| Then, in the midst of all the celestial beings, the eyes of all,
like blue lotuses, fell upon Srimalā, who was seated in the center. ||363||
Then, the celestial beings, whose hopes were set on the Swayamvara, and whose
minds were captivated by desire, displayed beautiful gestures. ||364|| One
celestial being, though his crown on his head was steady, was making it steady
with his hand, covered in the radiance of jewels. ||365|| Another, placing his
elbow near his waist, was twisting his body, yawning. His action made the joints
of his body crackle. ||366|| Another, with his hand, was pushing away a bright,
sword-like ray of light, which was standing in his path, and looking at it with
a sidelong glance. ||367||

**Sixth Chapter**   123 A certain man on the side was moving a chāmara, casting
occasional sidelong glances at it. The chāvara, with its soft, silky appearance,
revolved gently in the hands of the performer. (368) Covering his face with his
left hand, one man with an elevated arm drew back his right arm and released a
fist. (369) Gradually lifting a foot from the seated position, another one
placed it gently on the left thigh, engaging in the pleasure of the right side.
(370) A certain youth, who was observed by a young woman with his toe directed
at her, was scratching his foot resting on the palm of his hand. (371) Someone
managed the tightly bound waist string, resembling a cluster of jewels like the
serpent Śeṣa, releasing it firmly and once again binding it slowly. (372) One
particular youth was intertwining his fingers, tilting them upward, while
puffing up his chest to raise an arch of his arms. (373) Another youth, with
eyes wandering towards the young woman, was smiling as he took the hand of a
friend beside him, engaging in light-hearted conversation. (374) A young man,
upon whose chest was smeared sandalwood paste and on whom saffron was applied,
was gazing down at that expansive chest. (375) Another vidyādhar was entangling
the curly hair hanging down on his forehead with the fingers of his left hand.
(376) One young man, with red lips from chewing clean betel, was slowly pulling
them with his left hand, raising his eyebrows. (377) Another young one was
spreading the pollen of grains with his right hand while twirling a lotus upon
which bees were hovering. (378) At that time, within the assembly of svayamvara,
a great sound was being generated by the veenas, flutes, conches, mridangas, and
the musical instruments known as kahala, bheri, and mardaka. (379) Observing the
actions of great individuals, who were inwardly pleased and had formed separate
groups, the musical offerings were being recited. (380) After that, as the great
clamor subsided, the auspicious woman named Sumangalā, holding a golden staff in
her right hand, spoke the following words to the bride. At that time: 1.
śaṇḍaṣṭaḥ. 2. mūrdhni kha. 3. maṇḍalaiḥ ma., muḍḍukaiḥ ka. 4. vṛddha-m.

124 In the Padma Purana, the words of the girls with bowed heads and adorned
with jewels, resembling the wish-fulfilling tree, were spoken.  [382] Their
friendship, with soft hands like lotus flowers, was abandoned. They were
standing on a palanquin, adorned with the color of the Makara flag.  [383] The
king of this city, named Nabhastilaka, was born to the queen Vimala, the
daughter of the king Chandra Kundala.  [384] His name is Martanda Kundala, he
conquers the sun with his brilliance, he is endowed with qualities like peace,
war, etc., and for all these reasons, he has attained supreme prominence in his
circle.  [385] When the qualities of kings are discussed in assemblies, wise men
first mention his name, and due to excessive joy, their bodies become filled
with thorns of goosebumps.  [386] Daughter, if you have a desire to enjoy with
him, then accept this Martanda Kundala, who has seen the essence of all
scriptures.  [387] Then, the king of the Vidyadharas, whose youth had somewhat
faded, was rejected by Sri Mala simply by lowering her face.  [388] Then,
Sumangala, the nurse, said to her daughter, "Look at this prince, who is the
lord of all men, with his brilliance, radiance, and glory."  [389] He is the
lord of Ratnapura, the son of King Vidyanga and Queen Lakshmi, his name is
Vidyasamudhata, and he is the lord of all Vidyadharas.  [390] When his name is
heard, enemies tremble like the leaves of a peepal tree shaken by the wind,
fearing his prowess.  [391] Lakshmi, who was tired of wandering among many petty
kings, has found rest, as it were, on his broad chest, adorned with a necklace
as a pillow.  [392] Daughter, if you have a desire to sit in his lap, then
accept him. May lightning unite with Mount Meru.  [393] Then, Sri Mala looked at
him with simple eyes, and he was rejected. This is right, because a girl's gaze
becomes unsteady when she looks at the one she desires as her husband.  [394]
Then, Sumangala, knowing her intention, told her that she would see the king
again.  [395] The girl, with her humility and adorned with jewels, appeared like
a wish-fulfilling tree.  [381-382] Although her soft lotus-like hands were
resting on her friend's shoulder, they were slipping down. She was seated on a
palanquin and was ready to reveal her choice.  [383] Sumangala, the nurse,
introducing the arriving princes, said, "Daughter, this is the king of
Nabhastilaka, born to Queen Vimala, the daughter of King Chandra Kundala."
[384] His name is Martanda Kundala, he conquers the sun with his brilliance, he
is endowed with qualities like peace, war, etc., and for all these reasons, he
has attained supreme prominence in his circle.  [385] When the qualities of
kings are discussed in assemblies, wise men first mention his name, and due to

## Sixth Chapter  This is the son of Vajrayudha, born of Vajrashila. He is the
king of the city named Vajrapanjara. || 396 ||   On both his arms, Lakshmi,
shining like the sun, resides, though fickle by nature, she remains steadfast.
|| 397 ||  There are others who are called Khecharas, but they are merely in
name. This one, however, shines like the sun, surpassing those who are like
fireflies. || 398 ||  His head, naturally tall, has attained the highest height.
The crown adorned with sparkling gems, is only for further enhancement. || 399
||  Beautiful one, accept this lord of the Vidya-bhrutas, if you desire all the
pleasures like Shachi. || 400 ||  Seeing the Khechara-bhanu, the sun-like
Khechara, the maiden Kumudvati felt extreme shyness. Seeing this, the nurse
spoke again. || 401 ||  This is the son of Chitramvara and Padma-shri, born from
her womb. He is the eternal king of Chandra-pura, known as Chandra-nana. || 402
||  See, his chest is broad, adorned with beautiful sandalwood. It is embraced
by the rays of the moon, resembling the banks of Kailasa. || 403 ||  His chest
is adorned with a necklace of leaping pearls, like a waterfall cascading from
Kailasa. || 404 ||  The letters of his name, like rays, embrace the mind of even
an enemy, bringing supreme joy, free from sorrow and pain. || 405 ||  If your
heart finds joy in his beautiful form, then like the night with the moon, you
should unite with him. || 406 ||  But her mind did not find joy in him, just as
the lotus does not find joy in the moon, which brings delight to the eyes. ||
407 ||  Then the nurse said, "Daughter, look at this Purandara. He has descended
to earth, desiring your union. He is indeed Purandara, Indra himself." || 408 ||
This is the son of Merukanta and Shrir-ambha, born from her womb. He is the lord
of Mandara-kunja, his voice like thunder. || 409 ||  Taking her to the king, she
said, || 395 ||  "This king, Khechara-bhanu, the son of Vajrayudha and
Vajrashila, resides in the city named Vajrapanjara." || 396 ||

126 Padma Purana Those who are afflicted with fear in battle are unable to bear
the sight of him who has come face to face. How then can they withstand the
arrows of those who are skilled in warfare? || 410 || I believe that even Indra,
the lord of the gods, would be afraid of him. Indeed, his unbroken prowess roams
the entire earth. || 411 || O beautiful one with shapely hips, during the time
of loving conflict, strike his exalted head with your foot. || 412 || Even
Purandara, the king, could not find a place in his heart. This is because the
minds of people are diverse due to their own actions. || 413 || Just as a wave
in a lake carries a lotus to another lotus, so too did the nurse take the girl
to another Vidyadhara in the lake of all virtues, saying, "O daughter, look at
this king, Mahabala. This king was born to the queen named Vegini by the power
of Manojava. His speed is like that of the wind." || 414 - 415 || He is the lord
of the city of Naka, his pure qualities are beyond calculation. || 416 || By the
wind generated by the speed of his own body, he makes the entire earth revolve,
causing mountains to fall. || 417 || By the power of his knowledge, he can make
the earth ascend to the sky and show all the planets to those who dwell on the
earth. || 418 || Or he can create a fourth world besides the three worlds, make
the sun as cool as the moon, pulverize Mount Meru, make the wind still, dry up
the ocean, and give form to the sky. Or what more to say? Whatever he desires,
it happens. || 419-420 || The nurse said all this correctly, but the girl's mind
did not find a place in him. The girl knew all the scriptures, so she understood
that the nurse was exaggerating - there was no truth in her words. || 421 ||
Thus, the girl abandoned many Vidyadharas who were endowed with the power of
knowledge, whose wealth had been described by the nurse. || 422 || Thereafter,
just as the moonbeam leaves the mountains and they become dark, so too did the
girl leave the Vidyadharas, and they became filled with sorrow. || 423 ||

**Sixth Chapter**  Seeing the unique *khecharas* [sky-dwellers] and their mutual
gaze, the intention was to enter the earth, as if the earth itself were cracked
and about to swallow them (*strēpāvatām*). ||424|| Then, the *Dhātrī*
[nurturer], adorned with the light of the *khecharas*, was heard, and her gaze
fell upon *Kishkindha-kumāra* [the prince of Kishkindha] with great respect.
||425|| Then, the ornament of wreaths appeared in the sight of those present,
and affectionate conversations were exchanged through this wreath. ||426||
Thereafter, the glances of *Vijaya-Siṃha* [Victorious Lion] fell upon
*Kishkindha* and *Andhaka*, filled with pride due to their mastery of knowledge
(*vidyā-vīrye*). ||427|| "What is this *vidyādhara* society here? Where have you
two *khecharas* come?" said the prideful *Vijaya-Siṃha*, observing their
deformed appearance: "You are insignificant, monkeys, devoid of humility."
||428|| "Here there is no lovely forest filled with fruits, nor are there
beautiful mountains with waterfalls." ||429|| "The groups of *vanarīs* [monkey-
like beings] with faces red like flesh do not engage in ill deeds as desired."
||430|| "Who has called these monstrous *vanar* [monkey-shaped beings]? Today, I
shall destroy that wretched messenger!" ||431|| "Let us eradicate these wicked
beings from this place, and drive away their faith in achieving the
*vidyādhari*." ||432|| Angered by this harsh speech from *Vijaya-Siṃha*, both
*Kishkindha* and *Andhaka* became highly disturbed, like elephants disturbed by
a lion. ||433|| Then, the *śakti* (energy/power) of the remarks made about their
lord caused the *vidyādhara* army to engage in fierce actions, as if acting
madly aloud. ||434|| Some *sāmanta* (chief) began to strike the left shoulder
with his right hand, causing those around to be splattered with blood. ||435||
Another chief, his mind deeply disturbed, cast a fierce gaze upon the enemies
with anger, his eyes reddened like the fire of destruction. ||436|| A soldier,
trembling with rage, touched his chest with his right hand, while...

128 In the Padma Purana, someone struck another's hand with a smile, so much so
that the traveler became deaf for a long time. ||438|| Someone uprooted a branch
of a great tree whose roots were firmly bound to the earth, and which was
bearing tender leaves. ||439|| A monkey took the pillar of a stage and broke it
on his shoulder, so that the sky was filled with its scattered fragments.
||440|| Someone twisted his body so violently that his healed wounds burst open
again, and his body, drenched in copious streams of blood, resembled the havoc
of a deluge. ||441|| Someone laughed with a wide open mouth, as if he wanted to
fill the entire universe with sound. ||442|| Someone shook his matted hair so
violently that it filled all directions, and it seemed as if night had fallen
for a long time. ||443|| Someone struck his left arm with his right hand,
clenched tight, making a terrible, thunderous sound. ||444|| "O wicked
Vidyadharas! Suffer this destruction as the fruit of your harsh words!" Thus,
someone's mouth was filled with sound, that is, someone was shouting these
words. ||445|| Then, because of that unprecedented insult, the monkey-race came
forward to destroy the army of the Vidyadharas. ||446|| Then, elephants fought
with elephants, charioteers with charioteers, and foot soldiers with foot
soldiers, engaging in a terrible battle. ||447|| Thus, a great battle took place
between the two armies, a battle so great that it filled the group of gods
standing afar with wonder. ||448|| Hearing the news of the battle, the king of
the Rakshasas, named Sukesha, a friend of Kishkindha and Andhraka, arrived there
immediately, like a wish fulfilled. ||449|| Just as there was a great battle
before for the sake of Akompana's daughter, Sulochana, so too is this battle
happening now, for women are the cause of war. ||450|| 1. संकोचिते म.। 2.

## Sixth Chapter  129. While the fierce battle raged between the Vidyadharas and
Rakshasas, Kishkindha, having abducted the maiden, fled the battlefield. ||451||
Upon seeing the Vidyadhara king, Vijayasimha, approach, Andhrakabhu, with a
mocking laugh, struck down his head with his sword. ||452||  Just as a body
without a soul becomes a mere collection of senses, so too did the Vidyadhara
army become scattered without Vijayasimha. ||453||  Hearing of his son's death,
Asanivega was struck with grief, like a man struck by lightning. He was
enveloped in the darkness of unconsciousness. ||454||  After a while, his chest
soaked with the tears of his wives, Asanivega regained consciousness, his face
contorted with rage. ||455||  His retinue could not bear to look upon his form,
which resembled the blazing sun at the time of the apocalypse. ||456||
Surrounded by Vidyadharas, their weapons gleaming, he marched towards
Kishkupura, like a towering mountain. ||457||  Knowing the city was besieged,
the two brothers, Kishkindha and Sukeśa, accompanied by Taḍikeśi, marched out,
eager for battle. ||458||  The Vanara and Rakshasa armies, armed with maces,
javelins, arrows, nooses, spears, and swords, destroyed the Vidyadhara forces.
||459||  Wherever Andhrak, Kishkindha, or Sukeśa went, the path was littered
with the corpses of slain Vanaras. ||460||  Fueled by the fire of his son's
death, Asanivega, with a thunderous roar, charged towards Andhrak. ||461||
Seeing the young and wicked Andhrak, and the arrogant Asanivega, Kishkindha, the
embodiment of thunder, rose to meet them. ||462||  Asanivega's son,
Vidyudvahana, stood before him, and a fierce battle ensued. For it is said that
all defeat in the world is caused by women. ||463||  While the terrible battle
between Kishkindha and Vidyudvahana raged, Asanivega slew Andhrak. ||464||

130 In the Padma Purana, the young Andhrak fell to the earth, devoid of
radiance. He lay lifeless, resembling the pale light of the morning moon.
||465||   Kishkindha, struck by a stone thrown at his chest by the lightning-
chariot, fainted. But regaining consciousness, he hurled the same stone at
Kishkindha's chest, causing him to fall unconscious. ||466-467|| Then, filled
with love, the king of Lanka, Lakenndra, took him to Kishkupur, neglecting his
own safety. After a long time, Kishkindha regained consciousness. ||468|| When
he opened his eyes and did not see Andhrak, he asked those standing nearby,
"Where is my brother?" ||469|| At that moment, like the ocean churned by the
winds of destruction, he heard the cries of the inner palace, caused by
Andhrak's demise. ||470|| Overwhelmed by grief, Kishkindha lamented for a long
time, his heart filled with waves of sorrow born from the contemplation of his
brother's virtues. ||471|| "Oh brother! How could you die while I am alive? Your
death has broken my right arm." ||472|| "How could that wicked, evil man strike
you, a mere child, with a weapon? A curse upon that unjust villain!" ||473|| "I,
who would become anxious even if I didn't see you for a moment, how can I bear
to live now?" ||474|| "Or perhaps my heart is made of iron, for even knowing
your death, it refuses to leave my body." ||475|| "Remembering your gentle
smile, born from gatherings of valiant men, your radiant joy, I am consumed by
unbearable sorrow." ||476|| "Every playful act, every joy we shared, was like a
shower of nectar upon my entire being." ||477|| "But now, the memory of those
moments, instead of bringing joy, feels like a deadly poison, piercing my
heart." ||478|| Mar dala ||464||

## Sixth Chapter  131. Then, overwhelmed with grief for his brother, Kishkindha
lamented greatly. He was consoled by Sukeśa and others, who explained to him the
nature of true wisdom. ||479||  It is not fitting for the wise to engage in
petty actions like grieving. Indeed, the wise have recognized grief as a demon
with a different name. ||480||  When separation from loved ones occurs due to
the workings of karma, grief only brings further suffering. ||481||  A being who
acts with deliberation should always engage in activities that have a purpose.
Grief is purposeless and therefore not worthy of a wise person. ||482||  If
grief could bring back the deceased, then it would be appropriate to gather
others and grieve. ||483||  Grief, however, only serves to deplete the body. It
is a catalyst for sin and leads to deep delusion. ||484||  Therefore, abandon
this enemy, grief, and clear your mind. Focus your attention on what needs to be
done, for the enemy never abandons its nature. ||485||  Fools, immersed in the
mire of grief, destroy even their remaining actions. Their grief intensifies
when those who depend on them look at them with pity. ||486||  The force of
destruction, like the thunderbolt, is powerful and always present. We must
consider how to counter it now. ||487||  If the enemy is stronger, a wise person
should find a place to hide and wait for the opportune moment. This will prevent
defeat at the hands of the enemy. ||488||  When the time is right, even a foe
twice as powerful can be subdued. After all, prosperity does not always favor
the same person. ||489||  Therefore, the ancestral home of our lineage,
Alankārapura (Pātāla Laṅkā), has come to my mind. ||490||  The elders of our
clan praise it highly, and even our enemies are unaware of its existence. It is
so beautiful that even after attaining heaven, one would not desire to leave it.
||491||  Why have you become sorrowful? ||478||

132 From that, arise, let us go to that city, the enemy's fort. For it is a
great injustice to not spend time in this situation. ||492|| Thus, searching,
"There is no sorrow when it is intense, it subsides. From the sight of Sri Mala,
that sorrow of his, then, subsides." ||493|| Then, the two, with their entire
entourage, set out. They reached the sight of the enemy, the hater of the
electric chariot. ||494|| Then, he, being asked to go, set out, running after
the two. Enraged by the fratricide, he was determined to root out the enemy.
||495|| "Broken ones should not be pursued, enemies should not be pursued," it
is said. A man, knowledgeable in the body of the science of polity, with pure
intellect, ||496|| "He who killed your brother, the wicked enemy, I have made
him attain great sleep with arrows, the Andhrak." ||497|| "Therefore, son,
return, these are not our wrongdoers. Compassion should be shown to a greatly
distressed person." ||498|| "What should a wise man do to one who, by showing
his back, caused the sight of his own death? He is like a living dead." ||499||
While thus, the son was being instructed by Vajravega, the monkey and the demon
reached Alankarpur. ||500|| There, in the city situated in the netherworld,
illuminated by jewels, they stayed, bearing both sorrow and joy, free from fear.
||501|| Then, one day, Ashanivega, seeing the cloud of autumn, dissolving in an
instant, became detached from worldly possessions. ||502|| The happiness that
comes from the association of objects is fleeting, and it is very rare to obtain
human birth in the midst of the eighty-four lakh births. ||503|| Knowing this,
he gave the kingdom to his son, Sahasrar, according to the rules, and himself,
along with Vidhyutkumar, became a great Shraman, a renunciate. ||504|| In the
meantime, a celestial being named Nirghat, appointed by Ashanivega, ruled Lanka.
He was endowed with great knowledge and prowess. ||505||

## The Sixty-Fourth Chapter  133  Seeing the earth-sphere slowly from the depths
of the underworld, like a sacrifice to the One, He saw the earth adorned with
forests and mountains. ||506||  Knowing that his enemies had attained peace,
free from fear, Srimal went to Mount Meru to worship the Jina. ||507||
Returning from there, he saw on the banks of the southern ocean, A forest called
Prithvi-Karna-Tata, beautiful like the Devas. ||508||  He spoke to Srimal, whose
voice was as sweet as a vina, Who was seated close to his chest and held by his
left arm. ||509||  "My dear, see this beautiful forest, with trees adorned with
flowers, Whose waters flow gently, like a woman with a parting in her hair."
||510||  "This mountain, called Dharani-Mauli, stands tall, Like a cloud in the
autumn sky, with its high peaks." ||511||  "It is adorned with waterfalls,
shining with laughter, With foam like the white petals of the kunda flower."
||512||  "This forest of trees, swaying in the wind, Seems to offer us a flower
garland with its branches, as if in welcome." ||513||  "The wind, rich with the
fragrance of flowers, fills our nostrils, And the bowing trees seem to greet
us." ||514||  "This mountain, with its virtues, has bound me fast, I cannot
cross it and go further." ||515||  "I will build a palace here, inaccessible to
earth-dwellers, My happy mind indicates that this is auspicious." ||516||  "My
heart, which was saddened by dwelling in Alankarpur, in the depths of the
underworld, Will find joy here." ||517||  Having said this, he was encouraged by
his beloved, filled with wonder, And descended upon the mountain, scattering the
dense clouds. ||518||  The Mahavidya and Mahaparakrama-bearer, the Vidyadhara
named Nirghata, ruled Lanka. ||505||  One day, the Vidyadhara Nirghata, who was
like a sacrifice to the One, emerged from the underworld city of Alankarpur,
which was like the city of Bali, and slowly surveyed the earth-sphere, adorned
with forests and mountains. At that time, he learned that his enemies had
attained peace. Knowing this, he became fearless and, with his queen Srimal,
went to Mount Meru to worship the Jina. ||506-507||  After worshipping, while
returning, he saw a forest called Prithvi-Karna-Tata on the banks of the
southern ocean. This forest was as beautiful as the Devas. ||508||  Kishkindha,
whose voice was as sweet as a vina, who was seated close to his chest and held
by his left arm, said to his queen Srimal, ||509||  "My dear, see this beautiful
forest, with trees adorned with flowers, and whose waters flow gently, like a
woman with a parting in her hair." ||510||  "This mountain, called Dharani-
Mauli, stands tall, like a cloud in the autumn sky, with its high peaks."
||511||  "It is adorned with waterfalls, shining with laughter, with foam like
the white petals of the kunda flower." ||512||  "This forest of trees, swaying
in the wind, seems to offer us a flower garland with its branches, as if in
welcome." ||513||  "The wind, rich with the fragrance of flowers, fills our
nostrils, and the bowing trees seem to greet us." ||514||  "It seems that this
mountain, with its virtues, has bound me fast, and I cannot cross it and go
further." ||515||  "I will build a palace here, inaccessible to earth-dwellers.
My happy mind indicates that this is auspicious." ||516||  "My heart, which was
saddened by dwelling in Alankarpur, in the depths of the underworld, will find
joy here." ||517||  Having said this, he was encouraged by his beloved, filled
with wonder, and descended upon the mountain, scattering the dense clouds.

134 The king, adorned with all his kinsmen, built a city on the peak of the
mountain, a city like heaven, in a moment, with great joy. ||519|| He named it
after himself, the glorious one. That is why it is still called Kishkindhapur on
earth. ||520|| The mountain itself is also known as Kishkindha, from its
association with the city. Earlier, its name was Madhu, known throughout the
world. ||521|| The king, endowed with right vision and devoted to the worship of
the Jinas, enjoyed the highest pleasures and lived happily for a long time.
||522|| From him, two sons were born to Queen Srimalā. The elder was named
Suryaraja, and the younger was known as Yajñaraja. ||523|| And a daughter,
Suryakamala, was born, with a body as soft as a lotus. She, with her beauty,
made all the Vidyadharas restless. ||524|| Now, in the city of Meghapur, there
reigned a Vidyadhara king named Meru. To him, a son named Mrigāridaman was born
by his queen, Maghonī. ||525|| While wandering, he saw Suryakamala, the daughter
of Kishkindha. He was so smitten by her that he found no peace, neither by day
nor by night. ||526|| His friends, with respect, pleaded for her hand. The king
of Kishkindha, after consulting with Queen Srimalā, agreed to give her to him.
||527|| In the beautiful city of Kishkindha, adorned with flags and other
decorations, the auspicious marriage of Mrigāridaman and Suryakamala was
performed according to the rites. ||528|| Returning with her, he stayed on the
mountain called Karna. There, he built a city called Karnakundala. ||529|| To
the king of Alankarapur, Sukeśa, three mighty sons were born by his queen,
Indrāṇī. ||530|| The eldest was named Māli, the middle one was called Sumāli,
and the youngest was known as Mālyavān. All three sons were highly knowledgeable
and adorned with virtues. ||531||

The Sixth Chapter  The play of the princes was as wonderful as that of the gods,
and it captivated the minds of their parents, relatives, and enemies alike.
||532||  Their actions, born of the power emanating from their perfected
knowledge, were extremely bold. Their parents repeatedly tried to restrain them.
||533||  "O sons, if you go to the Kishkindha mountain for play due to your
youthful exuberance, never go near the southern ocean."  ||534||  Driven by
their youthful exuberance and the abundance of their curiosity, the princes
bowed and asked their parents the reason.  ||535||  "This is not something to be
spoken of, O sons," their parents replied.  ||536||  The princes, with their
sweet words, repeatedly pressed them.  ||536||  Then Sukesha told them, "Listen,
O sons. If you absolutely need to know the reason, then listen.  ||537||  Long
ago, in Lanka, a powerful and cruel Vidhyadhara named Nirghata was appointed to
rule by the force of lightning.  ||538||  That Lanka city, our auspicious city,
came to us through lineage.  ||539||  Though it was dear to us as our own lives,
we abandoned it out of fear of that powerful enemy.  ||539||  That wicked one
has appointed spies in every land, who are constantly vigilant in searching for
our weaknesses.  ||540||  He has set up devices in every place that kill those
who play in the sky.  ||541||  Those devices lure people in with their beauty
and then destroy them, just as the distractions that arise during meditation
destroy an incapable yogi.  ||542||  Hearing this, Mali sighed deeply, his eyes
filled with tears, thinking of his parents' sorrow.  ||543||  His mind filled
with anger, he smiled proudly for a long time.  ||544||  Looking at his strong
arms, he spoke, "Father, why did you not tell us this for so long?  ||545||  It
is amazing that you deceived us with such great affection.  ||545||  Those who
do not act but only roar uselessly, even if they are powerful, are considered
very weak in the world."  ||546||

136 Even though they are powerful in the world, they receive great disrespect.
||546|| Or let it be, what is the point of saying all this? O father! You will
attain peace by seeing the results. Until this task is completed, I will keep my
hair loose. ||547|| Then, the parents, frightened by the inauspicious omen, did
not dissuade them with words. They only looked at them with affectionate eyes
and said, "O sons! Go." ||548|| Then, the three brothers, like the dwellers of
the celestial abodes, emerged from the netherworld and marched towards the
enemy. At that time, the three brothers were filled with enthusiasm and were
ablaze with weapons. ||549|| Then, a river of demons, a host of demons, with a
torrent of moving weapons, spread across the sky, following them. ||550|| The
three sons marched on, and their hearts were filled with affection, and their
parents watched them with auspicious blessings as long as they were visible to
their eyes. ||551|| Then, from the peak of Trikuta mountain, they saw Lanka, and
with their mature vision, they thought, "We have already taken it." ||552|| As
they went, they killed many demons, subdued many, and displaced many from their
positions. ||553|| The vassals of the enemy side, humbled, joined the army, and
the three princes, who were the bearers of great strength, became endowed with a
large army. ||554|| Hearing of the arrival of the enemy, Nirghata, who was
skilled in warfare and whose shadow, cast by his moving umbrella, covered the
sun, emerged from Lanka. ||555|| Then, there was a great battle between the two
armies. Their great battle was a destroyer of beings, with horses, maddened
elephants, and countless chariots. ||556|| The sky seemed to be made of earth,
with the multitude of elephants, the water flowing from their cheeks seemed to
be made of water, the wind generated by their ear-shaped fans seemed to be made
of wind, and the fire generated by their mutual blows seemed to be made of fire.
||557-558|| What is the use of killing other, insignificant Vidyadharas in the
battle? Where is that wicked Nirghata? Where is he? Thus, he urged. 1. प्रौढ्या

## Sixth Chapter  Seeing Nirghāta without his chariot, Māli struck him with
sharp arrows and then finished him off with a sword strike.  ||560|| Knowing
Nirghāta was killed, the Dānavas with their minds corrupted went to their
respective abodes on Vijayārddha mountain. ||561|| Many Dānavas, fearful of
battle, hung swords around their necks and quickly sought refuge with Māli.
||562|| Then the three brothers, Māli and the others, entered Lankā, adorned
with auspicious things. They met with their parents and other loved ones.
||563|| Then Māli, according to the proper rites, married Candravati, a
beautiful daughter born to Hemā, the queen of Hemāpura, and Hemāvidyādhara.
Candravati brought joy to Māli's heart and was naturally fickle-minded, like a
net to capture deer-like senses. ||564-565|| Sumāli obtained Prīti, the daughter
of Prītikānta, the king of Prītikūṭapura, and Prītimati. ||566|| Mālyavān
married Kanakāvalī, the daughter of Kanaka, the king of Kanakābha, and Kanaknī.
||567|| These were their first wives, always dwelling in their hearts. Each of
them had a thousand other wives. ||568|| Then the two ranges of Vijayārddha
mountain, subdued by their prowess, bowed their heads in submission, like the
remaining grains of rice. ||569|| Finally, having established their sons firmly
in their positions and entrusted their wealth to them, Sukeśa and Kiṣkiṇdhā,
with peaceful minds, became liberated sages. ||570||  Thus, many great kings of
the Rākṣasa and Vānara lineages, having enjoyed worldly pleasures, finally
attained the path of liberation, taught by the Jinas, which destroys the
hundreds of faults of the world. They were freed from the bonds of affection
born from the qualities of their loved ones. ||571||

**The Seventh Chapter**  In the city, there was a king named Rathanūpur,
renowned as Sahasrāra, who was exceedingly valorous. ||1|| His beloved wife was
referred to as Mānasa-Sundarī. Mānasa-Sundarī was beautiful in both mind and
body and endowed with numerous excellent qualities. ||2|| She became pregnant.
Due to her pregnancy, her entire body became emaciated, and all her ornaments
loosened. Seeing her with great respect, the king Sahasrāra asked, "O beloved,
why do your limbs exhibit such extreme thinness? What is your desire that is
rare in my kingdom?" ||3-4||   "O dear one, who is more precious than life! Tell
me, what is your desire? Today, I shall fulfill it completely." ||5|| "O
darling! I am capable of commanding even the queen of the divine, Indrāṇī, so
that she may massage your feet with her hands." ||6|| Upon hearing this, Mānasa-
Sundarī, who was seated in his beautiful lap, spoke playfully and humbly: ||7||
"O lord! Since someone has entered my womb, my wish is to enjoy the wealth of
Indra." ||8|| "O master! Out of great helplessness, I have revealed these
desires to you without shame." ||9||   As soon as the beloved spoke this,
Sahasrāra, enriched with the power of knowledge, immediately prepared the wealth
of enjoyment like that of Indra for her. ||10|| Thus, upon the completion of her
pregnancy, her entire body became robust, and she began to embody a radiance and
beauty that was beyond description. ||11|| Her brilliance increased to such an
extent that she grew displeased even with the sun as it rose in the sky, and she
felt the urge to command all directions. ||12|| When the time came, she gave
birth to a son, who possessed all auspicious signs and was the best cause of joy
and wealth for her relatives. ||13||   Thereafter, the joyful Sahasrāra
celebrated the grand festival of the son's birth. At that time, the sounds of
conch shells and trumpets filled all the directions. ||14|| The women of the
city danced,

140 In the Padma Purana, wealth was given freely, without any thought. Even the
elephants danced with their swaying trunks. ||16|| Disasters occurred in the
homes of enemies, signifying sorrow. In the homes of relatives, auspicious omens
arose, indicating great wealth. ||17|| Because the mother desired to enjoy the
pleasures of Indra while the child was still in her womb, the father named him
Indra. ||18|| Even as a child, his games were those of a powerful young man,
conquering his enemies, humbling their pride, and engaging in noble deeds.
||19|| Gradually, he attained youth, surpassing the sun in brilliance, the moon
in radiance, and the mountains in steadfastness. ||20|| His chest was as broad
as an elephant's trunk, his arms round, and his vast chest seemed to encompass
all directions. ||21|| His thighs, strong as pillars, were round and with hidden
knees, achieving ultimate stability by supporting the edifice of his chest.
||22|| Through his victory, all the Vidhyadhara kings on Mount Vijayadhagi were
subdued, their pride humbled, and they became obedient to him, thanks to his
immense power and wealth. ||23|| He built a palace as magnificent as Indra's,
with forty-eight thousand wives. Twenty-six thousand dancers performed, and
there was an endless procession of elephants and horses that flew through the
sky. ||24-25|| There was a king of elephants, white as the moon, tall,
traversing the celestial courtyard, invincible, mighty, adorned with eight
tusks, with a large, round trunk that seemed to sweep through the directions,
renowned for his qualities on earth. He was named Airavata. ||26-27|| He
appointed four Lokapalas, each possessing supreme power in their respective

The seventh festival is in Ashwin, the eight Vasus, the four types of gods,
Narada, Tumburu, Visvavasu and other singers, Urvashi, Menaka, Manjuswani and
other Apsaras, and Brihaspati the minister, all these glories he had established
like Indra. ||29-31|| After that, he became the lord of all the Vidyadharas,
possessing the glory of Indra, obtained through the auspicious rise of Nami the
Vidyadhara. ||32|| At that time, Mali, the lord of Lanka, was a great and
powerful king, and he ruled over all the Vidyadharas as before. ||33|| Residing
in Lanka, Mali, proud of his brothers' strength, ruled over all the cities on
Mount Vijayad. ||34|| Whatever excellent things were reported by the spies in
both categories, such as courtesans, vehicles, airplanes, girls, clothes, and
ornaments, the brave and powerful Mali immediately brought them to his place. He
considered himself the best because of his strength, knowledge, and glory.
||35-36|| Now, having taken refuge in Indra, the Vidyadharas began to disobey
Mali's orders. Hearing this news, the mighty Mali, along with his brothers and
the sons of Kishkindha, set out for Mount Vijayad. ||37|| Some were riding on
airplanes of various hues, as high as the evening clouds, some were riding in
golden chariots resembling large palaces, some were riding on black elephants
like clouds, some were riding on horses that moved as fast as beads, some were
riding on tigers, some on cheetahs, some on bulls, some on lions, some on
camels, some on donkeys, some on buffaloes, some on swans, some on wolves, and
some on other vehicles. Thus, Mali, with his radiant body, covered the entire
sky with his various vehicles and approached Mount Vijayad. ||38-40|| Then,
Sumali, full of brotherly affection, said to Mali, "Brother, let us stay here
today, let us not go further, or let us return to Lanka. The reason is that we
have seen bad omens on the way again and again. ||41-42|| Look, there, a crow is
sitting on the top of a dry tree, with one leg contracted, flapping its wings
repeatedly. Its mind seems very disturbed, it is holding a dry stick in its
beak, looking towards the sun, and making a harsh sound.

142 In the Padma Purana, the dry wood and curd, seeing the sun, are preventing
our movement. ||44|| This jackal, with a face like a blazing fire, is roaring
terribly, with her hair standing on end, on our right side. ||45|| Look, in the
orb of the sun, surrounded by its rays, that terrible Kabantha is visible, and a
mass of blood drops is raining from him. ||46|| On the other side, terrible
forests are falling, shaking all the mountains, while on this side, all the
women with their hair loose are visible in the sky. ||47|| Look, on the right
side, that donkey is raising its head upwards, making the sky resound with its
loud voice, and digging the earth with its forelegs, making a terrible sound.
||48|| Then, the gardener, pressing his arms firmly with his armlets, smiled and
answered Sumali clearly, saying, "How can he who has set out to kill the enemy,
mounted on a victorious elephant, and bearing the mark of valor, return?"
||49-50|| He who is shaking the tusks of the intoxicated elephant, who has
terrified the enemies with his eyes alone, who is filled with sharp arrows, who
has bitten his lower lip, whose face is distorted with furrowed brows, and whom
the gods are watching in amazement, does such a warrior return? ||51-52|| I have
roamed in the caves of Mount Meru and in the beautiful Nandana forest, and have
built sky-touching Jain temples. ||53|| I have given whatever gifts were
desired, enjoyed the best of pleasures, and earned fame that illuminates the
entire world. ||54|| I have fulfilled the purpose of my birth, so what if I have
to give up my life in battle? I have no need for anything else. ||55|| "He ran
away from the battle in fear," how can a brave man listen to such words from the
people? ||56|| Saying this, the gardener, whose face was blazing with anger,
went to the peak of the victory mountain in an instant, without anyone knowing.

The Seventh Chapter 143. The king of the aerial beings, enraged, destroyed those
cities with his fierce followers, which had insulted his rule. ||50|| Just as
intoxicated elephants destroy lotus groves, so did those angry aerial beings
destroy the gardens. ||59|| Then, oppressed by the aerial beings, the people,
trembling with fear, went to the shelter of the Sahasrar. ||60|| Prostrating at
his feet, they spoke these humble words: "O Lord, protect us, for the sons of
Sukeśa have destroyed all our people." ||61|| Then the Sahasrar said to the
aerial beings: "Go to my son Indra and tell him your plight." ||62|| Just as
Indra, the protector of the heavens, protects his strong rule, so does my son,
the destroyer of evil, protect this world. ||63|| Thus, having received the
answer of the Sahasrar, the aerial beings went to Indra, and, joining their
hands in salutation, narrated the whole story. ||64|| Then Indra, with a proud
smile and a face shining white, looked at the thunderbolt held in his hand, his
eyes red with anger, and said: ||65|| "I am eager to find and destroy those
thorns of the world, and now you have come to me yourselves, and I am called the
protector of the world." ||66|| Then, to announce the battle, he sounded a
terrible trumpet, the sound of which made even the maddened elephants break
their chains. ||67|| Hearing this, the aerial beings, adorned with armor,
weapons in their hands, and filled with the joy of battle, came out of their
homes. ||68|| They rode on magical chariots, horses, elephants, camels, lions,
tigers, wolves, deer, swans, goats, bulls, rams, airplanes, peacocks, and
donkeys. ||69|| Besides these, the Lokapalas, adorned with the brilliance of
various weapons, and with their faces distorted by the frown of their brows,
came out with their retinues. ||70|| Indra, whose body was covered with armor,
and over whom a white umbrella was held, mounted his elephant Airavata and went
forth with the gods. ||71|| 1. शासयामास क., ख. । 2. रक्षस्यूजित म. । 3.

In the Padma Purana, a terrible battle erupted between the gods and demons, a
sight of cruelty and horror. Horses fell upon horses, chariots crushed chariots,
elephants trampled elephants, and foot soldiers destroyed foot soldiers. The sky
was covered with weapons: spears, maces, discs, swords, muskets, maces, arrows,
clubs, gold, and nooses. The gods, led by the valiant Vidyaadharas, formed an
army filled with great enthusiasm, skilled in advancing, generous, and capable
of disrupting the enemy's efforts. The gods' army, led by Vidyuutvaan,
Charudaan, Chandra, Nityagati, and Chalajyoti Prabhaadhya, devastated the demon
army. Then, the valiant Rishyaraj and Suryaraj, leaders of the monkey clan,
prepared to fight, seeing the demons being destroyed. These two heroes possessed
such speed that they appeared in different places every moment. They struck the
gods so hard that they turned their backs. The demons, emboldened by the
strength of these two, prepared to fight, filling the sky with darkness with
their weapons. Seeing the god's army being destroyed by the demons and monkey
clan, Indra, filled with rage, rose to fight himself. Then, the monkey and demon
clouds, raining weapons and roaring loudly, surrounded the mountain-like Indra.
Protecting the guardians of the world, Indra roared loudly and began to destroy
the monkeys and demons with arrows shot from all sides. Seeing his army in
disarray, Mali rose himself, his anger-born radiance illuminating the entire
sky. Then, a fierce battle ensued between Mali and Indra, watched with awe by
both armies, whose minds were filled with wonder. Then, Indra shot an arrow,
pulled back to the ear and marked with his name, into Mali's forehead. Mali,
suppressing the pain, struck Indra on the forehead with a swiftly released
weapon.

## Seventh Chapter  The enraged Mali, whose body was reddened with blood, rushed
towards Indra, just as the sun approaches the setting horizon.  || 87 ||  As
Mali approached, Indra severed his head with his chakra, which shone like the
sun. || 88 ||  Seeing his brother slain, Sumali was deeply distressed.  He
pondered that Indra, the chakra-wielding king of the Vidyadharas, was immensely
powerful, and it was impossible to stand against him.  Thus, the wise and
skillful Sumali, along with his entire family, fled the battlefield immediately.
|| 89-90 ||  As Indra was about to slay Sumali, Soma, devoted to his master,
bowed and said, "My Lord, why do you exert yourself when a servant like me is
present to kill the enemy?  Please allow me to do it." || 91-92 ||  Indra
replied, "So be it."  Soma then followed the enemy, showering him with a volley
of arrows, like a swarm of bees attacking their target. || 93 ||  The army of
the monkey-demons, struck by the arrows, was thrown into disarray, like a herd
of cows caught in a downpour. || 94 ||  "You are surrounded by fools and
ignorant of the rules of war, you wicked one!"  Mali, blazing with anger, turned
to Soma and, with his weapon called Bhindimala, struck him deeply in the chest,
rendering him unconscious. || 95-96 ||  While Soma lay unconscious, his eyes
closed, the demons and monkeys vanished. || 97 ||  They returned to their abode,
Alankarodayapur (Patal Lanka), safe from Soma's wrath, as if they had been
reborn. || 98 ||  When Soma regained consciousness, he saw the battlefield empty
of enemies.  He was praised for his victory and returned to Indra. || 99 ||
Indra, pleased with his chakra-wielding warrior, praised Soma, who had
vanquished his enemies.  He was also honored by the Lokapalas. || 100 ||

146 Indra, mounted on Airavata, with chamaras waving, shaded by a white
umbrella, with dancing gods in front, entered the city of Rathnapur. The city
was adorned with banners of jewels, and high arches, and the streets were strewn
with flowers up to the ankles, and sprinkled with saffron water. The women in
the windows looked on with their eyes. He entered the city with great
prosperity. He bowed to his parents with folded hands, and they touched his body
with trembling hands. Having conquered his enemies, he came to great joy,
enjoying the highest pleasures, and devoted to the protection of his subjects.
He became famous in the world, and the mountain of Vijay was called heaven.  I
will now tell you the origin of the Lokapalas. Listen with your mind focused, O
Shrenika.  Soma, the Lokapala, was born from the womb of Aditi, the wife of
Makaradhwaja, a Vidyadhara, who had fallen from heaven. He was very radiant.
Indra placed him in the east of the city of Dyotisanga, and he enjoyed his time
with great prosperity.  Varuna, the Lokapala, was born from the womb of Varuna,
the wife of Megha-ratha, a Vidyadhara. Indra placed him in the west of the city
of Meghapur. His weapon was the noose, and his enemies were afraid of it from
afar.  Kubera, the Lokapala, was born from the womb of Kanakavali, the wife of
the great Kisury, a Vidyadhara. He was endowed with great prosperity. Indra
placed him in the north of the city of Kanchanapur. He was famous in the world
for his wealth, and enjoyed the highest pleasures.  Yama, the Lokapala, was born
from the womb of Shri-prabha, the wife of Kala-agni, a Vidyadhara. He was a
fierce Rudra-karma, and very powerful. Indra placed him in the south of the city
of Kishkun, on the island of Dakshina-udanta. He enjoyed the fruits of his good
deeds.

## Seventh Chapter  **147**  The city whose name was renowned on earth, the king
of the city was known by the same name. ||116||  Those who reside in the city of
Asura, the celestial beings, are known as Asuras throughout the earth. ||117||
The Yakshas in the city of Yaksha-geet are called Yakshas, the Kinnaras in the
city of Kinnara are called Kinnaras, and those in the city of Gandharva are
known as Gandharvas. ||118||  Ashwini, Vasu, Vishwe, and Vaishvanara, along with
their followers, engage in divine play, endowed with knowledge and strength.
||119||  Having attained a human birth, and obtaining vast wealth on earth, he
considered himself the king of the gods, worshipped by all beings. ||120||
Indra, heaven, and other gods were all forgotten by him. He was delighted with
his wealth and constantly celebrated festivals. ||121||  He considered himself
Indra, Mount Meru as heaven, the celestial beings as guardians of the realms,
and all his subjects as gods, filled with pride. ||122||  There is no one
greater than me in the three worlds. I am the creator of this universe, the
knower of all things. ||123||  Having attained the position of a Chakravarti, he
was filled with pride, experiencing the fruits of his good deeds from past
lives. ||124||  Listen to the story of how Dhanada came to be, the one who
transgressed in this chapter, as it is known to the Shreniks. ||125||  In the
city of Kautukamangal, there lived a celestial being named Vyombinda. His wife,
Nandavati, gave birth to two daughters. ||126||  The elder was named Kaushiki,
and the younger was Kekasi. The elder daughter was given to Vishrava, the
wealthy Yaksha of Yakshapur. ||127||  From her was born Vaishravana, with
auspicious features. He had a hundred eyes, was wealthy, and a delight to the
eyes of women. ||128||  Thus, Indra called Vaishravana and honored him, saying,
"Go to Lanka and rule over my celestial beings. You are dear to me." ||129||
From today onwards, you shall be the fifth guardian of the four realms, endowed

Translation preserving Jain terms:  148 Having said "As you have commanded", and
having paid obeisance at the feet, he took leave of his parents. The auspicious
one (Rathnaśravā) departed. (131)  Freed from doubts, he resided in Laṅkā with
great delight. The assembly of Vidyādharas held his command on their heads.
(132)  He who was born to the beloved Sumālī's wife, the valorous, generous, and
world-beloved Rathnaśravā by name. (133)  Whose life was for the benefit of
friends, whose lordship was for the service of servants, and whose brilliance
was great. (134)  Whose skill was for the aid of those with destroyed evil
intentions, whose protection of Lakṣmī was for the benefit of kinsmen. (135)
Whose divinity was elevated for the aid of the destitute, whose all was for the
aid of the virtuous protector of all. (136)  Whose mind was for the remembrance
of good deeds, whose life was the instrument of Dharma, whose body was for the
aid of valor. (137)  Who was compassionate towards the class of living beings
like a father, and is still remembered by creatures as a past auspicious time.
(138)  For whom other women were like mothers due to his virtuous conduct,
other's wealth was like grass, and others' bodies were like his own. (139)  Who
was counted first among the virtuous by the wise, and was not even remembered by
creatures among the faulty. (140)  His body was made by other great elements,
otherwise how could such unique beauty have arisen in him? (141)  He made
conversation like nectar, and performed great donations as if they were his
nature. (142)  Among the affairs of Dharma, Artha, and Kāma, for that great-
minded one, Dharma alone was the great endeavor in the next birth. (143)  He was
the fifth Lokapāla, besides the four Lokapālas. (130)

The Seventh Chapter 149 Fame is the ornament of ornaments, the best of all
ornaments. Virtues reside in him like family members along with fame. ||144||
Desiring the highest prosperity, he came from his lineage. He was displaced from
his position by Indra, the king of the gods. ||145|| Abandoning fear, the brave
one was capable of achieving knowledge. He went to the forest of flowers, where
ghosts, goblins, and other such beings were roaring. ||146|| While he was
learning knowledge, Vyombindu sent his daughter, who was already knowledgeable
about knowledge and who was destined to become Ratnashrava's wife, to serve him
during his penance. ||147|| She stood respectfully near the yogi, her hands
folded, waiting for his command. ||148|| Then, when Ratnashrava's penance was
completed, he bowed to the perfected Lord. At that time, his eyes fell upon
Kekasi, who was standing alone. Simplicity was dripping from her eyes. ||149||
Her eyes were like blue lotuses, her face like a lotus, her teeth like buds of
jasmine, her arms like garlands of shirisha flowers, and her lower lip like a
rose. ||150|| The fragrance of jasmine flowers emanated from her breath, her
complexion was like that of a champak flower, and her entire body seemed to be
made of flowers. ||151|| Kekasi, standing near Ratnashrava, seemed as if
Lakshmi, captivated by his form, had left her lotus-shaped home and come to him
with great longing, her eyes fixed on his feet. ||152|| Her body was bending
downwards due to the shame caused by seeing the extraordinary man, and her
breasts were trembling with the fear-filled breaths she was taking. ||153|| She
was touching the nearby leaves with her beauty, and the fragrance of her breath
was attracting a swarm of intoxicated bees, making the forest restless. ||154||
She was bending so low due to her extreme delicacy that youth was embracing her
with fear. Kekasi was like the ultimate creation. ||155|| To gather all the
wonders of the world, as if...  1. Pushpantakam ma.  2. Madyodnabhavini k. kh.

150 In the Padma Purana, she appeared as if Vidya herself had taken a physical
form, subdued by the great austerity of Ratnaśrava, and radiant with brilliance.
||157|| With loving words, Ratnaśrava, compassionate by nature, and especially
kind to women, and even more so to young girls, asked, "O child, whose daughter
are you? And why are you standing alone in this great forest, like a deer
separated from its herd?" ||158-159|| "O one with virtuous aspirations, what are
the letters of your name?" Ratnaśrava asked Kekasi. This was appropriate, for
even among the virtuous, there is partiality towards the noble. ||160|| With a
voice choked with emotion, and possessing infinite sweetness, capable of
stealing hearts, Kekasi replied, "I am the daughter of King Vyomābindhu, born
from the body of Mandavati. My name is Kekasi, and I have come to serve you, as
instructed by my father." ||161-162|| At that very moment, the Vidya named
Manasastambhini, possessing great power, became manifest to Ratnaśrava. ||163||
Then, by the power of that Vidya, in that very forest, Ratnaśrava instantly
established a city named Pushpāntaka. ||164|| Taking Kekasi as his wife
according to the proper rites, he enjoyed the pleasures of the city, fulfilling
all his desires. ||164-165|| Between them, there arose an unparalleled love,
such that they could not bear even a moment's separation. ||166|| If Kekasi was
out of sight of Ratnaśrava's eyes, even for a moment, he would think she was
dead. And if Kekasi did not see him for a moment, she would become pale, her
facial radiance fading. Such was her tender heart. ||167|| Ratnaśrava's eyes
were always fixed on Kekasi's moon-like face, or rather, Kekasi was like a bond
for all of Ratnaśrava's senses. ||168|| Their bond was based on unparalleled
beauty, youth, wealth, the power of knowledge, and the virtue they had
accumulated in the past. ||169|| When she walked, she walked with him; when she
stood, she stood with him. Like a shadow, she followed her husband everywhere.
||170|| Karma had created her beauty, gathering the beauty of all women in the
three worlds. ||156|| She, Kekasi, seemed as if Vidya herself had taken a
physical form, adorned with the brilliance of a gem, subdued by the great
austerity of Ratnaśrava. ||157||

Seventh Chapter  Then the queen Kekasī lay on a magnificent bed that was
expansive, beautiful, and as white as the ocean of milk, illuminated by the
light of jewel lamps, soft as silken fabric. (171) Upon it was a comfortable
mattress laid out, adorned with colorful pillows, surrounded by humming bees
awakened by the fragrance of her breath. (172) Around her were women standing
guard, viewing her with sleepless eyes; by her side was a small pedestal made of
ivory, such was the grandeur of the bed on which Kekasī, while contemplating the
qualities of her husband who binds the mind, and desiring the birth of a son,
joyfully lay sleeping. (173-174)  At that time, while being still and
meditative, the attentive friends of hers, scrutinizing her body, saw distinct
and wondrous dreams produced by Kekasī. (175) Then, following the sound of
conch-like morning horns and the soothing voices of the bards, Kekasī awoke to
consciousness. (176) After engaging in auspicious activities and adopting a
favorable and superior demeanor, captivating her mind, she approached her
husband with her friends. (177) There, with folded hands, displaying gestures,
she sat next to her husband on an elegantly draped seat and recounted her
dreams. (178)  She said, "O Lord! Last night during the last watch of the night,
I beheld three dreams; please rejoice upon hearing them." (179) In the first
dream, I saw a lion, radiant with great splendor, descending from the sky and
entering my body through the mouth. (180) In the second dream, I beheld the sun
in the mid-sky, removing the dark gloom, resembling a herd of elephants with its
rays. (181) In the third dream, I saw a charming moonlight dispeller standing
before us, milking darkness with its rays. (182) Upon seeing these dreams, my
mind was captivated.  (Note: The translation retains the original structure and
boldness of the Sanskrit words for context, while adapting the prose for clarity
in English.)

152 "O Lord, what is this? You are the one who should know this now. For in
matters concerning women, the husband's mind is the authority." (184) Then,
Ratnaśrava, skilled in the eightfold auspicious signs and proficient in the
Jina's teachings, explained the meaning of the dream in detail with joy. (185)
"O Devi, you will have three sons whose fame will spread throughout the three
worlds. They will be great heroes and bring prosperity to your lineage." (186)
"Due to their good deeds accumulated in past lives, they will perform noble
actions, be equal to the gods, and even be beloved by them." (187) "Their
radiance will eclipse the moon, their brilliance will outshine the sun, their
depth will surpass the oceans, and their steadfastness will rival the
mountains." (188) "After enjoying the fruits of their virtuous deeds in heaven,
they will experience the ripening of the remaining karma. They will be
invincible, even to the gods." (189) "They will be like clouds that fulfill
desires through their generosity, they will be as wealthy as emperors, and they
will captivate the hearts and eyes of the most beautiful women." (190) "Their
chests will be adorned with the auspicious Śrīvatsa mark, and the mere mention
of their names will destroy powerful enemies." (191) "The first of these sons
will be a great benefactor to the world. He will be deeply devoted to acts of
courage and will be like the moon, closing the lotus of his enemies." (192) "He
will be so passionate about war that when he goes to battle, his entire body
will be covered in standing hairs, like thorns." (193) "He will be a storehouse
of terrible deeds, and once he has set his mind on something, even Indra cannot
stop him." (194) Hearing these words, Keksi, filled with immense joy, smiled
softly and, looking at her husband's face, spoke with humility: "O Lord, our
minds are purified by the taste of the nectar of the Jina's teachings. How then
can this son, born to us, be a cruel doer?" (195-196) "Surely, our marrow has
been refined by the words of the Jina. How can a son of ours be born who is like
poison? Does poison ever sprout from the vine of nectar?" (197) Ratnaśrava
replied: "My dear, O beautiful-faced one, listen. Karma is the cause of this,
not us. We are not the agents of the action." (198)

The Seventh Chapter 153 Karma is the root cause of the nature of karma, while
parents are merely the instruments in the plan of the world. ||199|| His two
younger brothers will be experts in the path of the Jinas, filled with a
multitude of virtues, possessors of excellent conduct, and oceans of good
character. ||200|| Fearing a fall in the world, they will be firmly attached to
virtuous deeds, devoted to truthful speech, and compassionate to all beings.
||201|| O gentle-voiced and compassionate one! The good karma accumulated by
those two sons is the cause of their nature, for the fruit is always equal to
the cause. ||202|| Having said this, the parents, ever vigilant, performed the
worship of the Jina with a joyful heart. ||203|| Then, when the first child was
in the womb, the mother's conduct became extremely cruel. She desired to conquer
the group of men by force. She wished to place her foot on the heads of her
enemies, who were smeared with blood and mud and were writhing in pain.
||204-205|| She even intended to command the king of the gods, Indra. Her mouth
roared without any reason. ||206|| Her body became hard, she toiled excessively
in conquering her enemies, her voice was harsh and grating, and her glances were
sharp and silent. ||207|| Even though a mirror was present, she looked at the
sword, and even in bowing to her teachers, her head bent with great difficulty.
||208|| Then, when the time was full, the child emerged from the mother's womb,
shaking the seats of his enemies. What creature was as cruel as he in that
entire time? ||209|| The radiance of the child, difficult to look at like the
sun, caused the eyes of the people working in the delivery room to become as if
covered by a dense forest. ||210|| Because of the beating by the spirits, a very
loud sound arose from the drums, and headless bodies danced in the houses of the
enemies, signifying destruction. ||211|| Then, the father held a grand birth
celebration for his son. It was such a celebration that the people were like
madmen, doing whatever they pleased. ||212||

## Chapter 154 of the Padma Purana  **Verse 213:** In the womb-like Meru cave,
the child lay smiling, his red feet twitching, his gaze directed upwards.
**Verse 214:** He playfully shook the ground near his bed, shining like the
rising sun.  **Verse 215:** The necklace, given by the Rakshasa king to the
cloud-chariot rider, guarded by a thousand Naga princes, radiating brilliance,
was never worn by anyone else due to fear of the Rakshasas.  **Verse 216:** The
child, without any effort, pulled the necklace with his hand, out of sheer
affection.  **Verse 217:** Seeing the necklace in the child's fist, the mother
was alarmed. She embraced him with great love and kissed his head.  **Verse
218:** The father, seeing the child with the necklace, was filled with wonder.
He thought, "This must be a great man."  **Verse 219:** Who else could play with
this necklace, guarded by Naga kings, unless he possessed extraordinary power?
**Verse 220:** The words spoken by the Charana sage in the past were true, for
the words of the sages never fail.  **Verse 221:** Seeing this wonder, the
mother, free from fear, adorned the child with the necklace. The necklace, with
its cluster of rays, illuminated the ten directions.  **Verse 222:** The child
was named Dashaanan (Ten-faced) because the large, clear gems in the necklace
reflected nine additional faces, besides the real one.  **Verse 223:** After
Dashaanan, Bhanukarna was born. His cheeks were so beautiful that it seemed as
if the sun itself was adorned on his ears.  **Verse 224:** Then, Chandranakha,
whose face was like the full moon, was born. Her nails, shining like the rising
half-moon, illuminated all directions.  **Verse 225:** After Chandranakha,
Vibhishana was born. He was gentle and virtuous, and his very birth instilled
fear in the wicked.  **Verse 226:** Vibhishana seemed like the embodiment of
Dharma itself, and his fame, born of his virtues, remains pure in the world.

The Seventh Chapter  Even the playful activities of the young Dashagriva were
terrifying, while the playful activities of his two younger brothers brought joy
even to his enemies. || 227 || Among her brothers, the beautiful Chandra-nakha
shone like the evening twilight, adorned with excellent deeds, amidst the sun
and moon. || 228 || Then, the young Dashagriva, adorned with a tuft of hair, sat
in his mother's lap, spreading moonlight with the rays of his teeth, as it were,
in all ten directions. At that time, Vaishravana was going somewhere in the sky.
He was illuminating the directions with his brilliance, adorned with a group of
Vidyadharas, endowed with glory and power, and surrounded by those elephant-like
clouds that were shining with lightning-like garlands, releasing streams of
intoxicating water, and whose ears seemed like conch shells hanging from the
sky. Vaishravana was making the group of directions resound with the great sound
of his trumpet, which deafened the ears. He was the bearer of great power, and
with his huge army, he seemed to be swallowing and releasing the sky in front of
him. Dashagriva looked at him with a serious gaze. || 229 - 233 || Dashagriva,
being playful due to his childhood, saw the glory of Vaishravana and, laughing,
asked his mother, "O Mother! Who is this, going from here, considering the whole
world as grass, surrounded by a huge army?" || 234 - 235 || Then his mother said
to him, "This is your maternal uncle's son. He has mastered many arts, is
endowed with great wealth, is famous in the world, is endowed with great wealth,
and, like a second sun, makes enemies tremble as he wanders the world." || 236 -
237 || Indra, the Vidyadhara, killed your grandfather's brother, Mali, in
battle, and gave Lanka, which had been taken away from your father, to him, so
he protects Lanka. || 238 || For the sake of this Lanka, your father thinks of
hundreds of desires, and neither finds peace in the day nor sleep at night. ||
239 || O son! I am also consumed by this thought, and for a man, death is better
than the loss of his home. || 240 ||

156 In the Padma Purana, O son, when will you attain the Lakshmi befitting your
lineage? Seeing whom, our minds will be free from sorrow, like a wound that has
been healed. ||241|| When will I see these two brothers of yours, adorned with
prosperity, roaming freely in the world, free from thorns? ||242|| Hearing his
mother's sorrowful words, Vibhishana, with the sprouts of anger like poison
rising within him, smiled proudly and said, ||243|| "O Mother! Whether he is a
Dhanada or a Deva, what power have you seen in him that makes you lament like
this? ||244|| You are a mother of heroes, yourself a hero, and knower of all
human endeavors. Why then, being such, do you speak like other women? ||245||
Just consider, whose chest is marked with the Srivatsa symbol, who bears a vast
body, whose daily actions are always filled with wonder, who is mighty, and who,
like fire covered with ashes, is capable of burning the entire universe. Has
this Dasananan never entered your mind? ||246-247|| This one, by the power of
his speed born of disrespect, can conquer the mind and shatter the peaks of
Sumeru with the clap of his hands. ||248|| You do not know that his arms are the
paved roads of his prowess, the pillars of the house of the universe, and the
sprouts of the tree of pride. ||249|| Thus praised by his brother Vibhishana, a
knower of virtues and arts, Ravana attained great power, like fire from ghee.
||250|| He said, "Mother, what is the benefit of praising yourself so much? But
I will tell you the truth, listen. ||251|| Even if all the Vidhyadharas, puffed
up with pride in their knowledge, come together in the battlefield, they will
not be enough for even one of my arms. ||252|| Still, the worship of knowledge
is befitting our lineage, therefore, we should not be ashamed to do it. ||253||
Just as the virtuous diligently worship penance, so too, the descendants of the
Vidhyadharas should diligently worship knowledge.

The Seventh Chapter 157 Having said this, Ravana, holding his pride, went out
with his two younger brothers. He was kissed on the head by his parents and
offered salutations to the Siddhas.  ||255|| He received the auspicious rites,
his mind firm in his resolve.  He left the house joyfully, his steps light and
his head bowed in reverence. ||256|| In a moment, he reached and entered the
great forest called Bhima, filled with the roars of cruel creatures with
fearsome fangs. ||257|| The great trees were shaken by the breaths of sleeping
serpents, and the earth trembled under the steps of dancing Vyantaras. ||258||
The dense darkness, impenetrable even to a needle, filled the great caves of
that land.  Time itself seemed to dwell in that fearsome forest. ||259|| Even
the gods, afraid, did not go above it, and it was famous throughout the three
worlds for its terror. ||260|| The mountains there were inaccessible, their
caves filled with darkness, and the strong trees seemed ready to swallow the
world. ||261|| With unwavering minds, they took up the supreme peace, their
souls free from greed, clad in white garments. ||262|| Their faces were as
beautiful as the full moon, adorned with jeweled tiaras.  The three brothers
began their great penance. ||263|| They mastered the eight-syllabled Vidya
called Sarva-Kama-Annada, completing a lakh of repetitions in half a day.
||264|| This Vidya brought them whatever food they desired, so they were free
from the suffering of hunger. ||265|| Then, with pure hearts, they began to
chant the sixteen-syllabled mantra, whose ten thousand crore repetitions are
mentioned in the scriptures. ||266|| Then, the king of Jambudvipa, the Yaksha
called Anaavrita, surrounded by his wives, came to that forest, desiring to
play. ||267|| The three brothers, their souls absorbed in penance, came into the
sight of the Yaksha's wives, who were playing with abandon. ||268||

##  Translation:  158 In the Padma Purana, the goddesses were brought near,
their minds filled with curiosity, as if their beauty had seized their very
essence.  ||269|| Some of them, with their faces adorned with curled hair,
spoke, their beauty resembling that of a lotus. ||270|| Their bodies were
extremely delicate, their radiance and brilliance spreading everywhere, yet they
had not renounced their garments. Why are you performing austerities? ||271||
Such radiance of the body cannot be attained without enjoyment. And with such
bodies, you cannot be afraid of anyone. ||272|| Where is the weight of these
matted locks, and where is this youthful prime? Surely you were born to create a
union of opposites. ||273|| Why do you subject your hands, which are fit for the
pleasure of soft, full breasts, to the pain of contact with stones and other
rough objects? ||274|| Oh, what a foolish mind you have, you beautiful ones! To
inflict such suffering on a body fit for enjoyment! ||275|| Arise, let us go
home. What are you waiting for, wise men? Enjoy the sight of beautiful things,
and partake in great pleasures with us. ||276|| They spoke thus, but their words
did not find a place in the minds of the three brothers, just as drops of water
do not find a place on the petals of a lotus. ||277|| Then other goddesses said
to each other, "My friends, these are surely made of wood, puppets! That is why
their entire bodies are motionless." ||278|| Saying this, and filled with anger,
they approached and struck the three brothers' large hearts with their earrings.
||279|| Yet, the three brothers, with their keen minds, did not become agitated.
This is fitting, for cowards are easily swayed from their intended purpose.
||280|| Then, the lord of Jambudvipa, the Yaksha, whose mind was filled with
wonder at the goddesses' words, smiled at the three brothers and said, ||281||
"Oh, good men, why are you performing such difficult austerities? Or, which god
are you worshipping? Tell me quickly." ||282||

**Saptamaṁ Parva**  When the yakṣas spoke thus and remained immovable like clay
figures, the lord of the yakṣas became angry and spoke in this manner: 283.
"Forgetful of me, they are eager to meditate on some other god. Alas! how
capricious these fools are!" 284. Thereupon, the fierce yakṣa, having uttered
harsh words, commanded his servants who were awaiting orders to disturb these
three brothers. 285. By their very nature, they were cruel, and having received
such orders from their lord, they began to perform various acts in different
forms before them. 286. One of the yakṣas leapt energetically, higher than a
mountain, and fell before them as if all directions were being struck by
thunderbolts. 287. Another yakṣa, coiling itself like a serpent, wrapped around
their entire bodies, and yet another appeared as a lion, wide-mouthed and
fierce. 288. They made a dreadful sound near the ears, rendering all directions
deaf, while some adopted the forms of biting devils, elephants, thunderstorms,
wildfires, and oceans, creating disturbances in varied forms. 289. When the
three brothers, whose minds were steadfast like a pillar of meditation, did not
get disturbed by these diversions as mentioned above, 290. a great fearful army
of mlecchas was manifested through agitation. This army, filled with exceedingly
wrathful chandālas, appeared fierce with sharp weapons, akin to a mass of
darkness. 291. Then they showed that, having won the war, they had destroyed the
city of Puṣpāntaka and captured your father Ratnaśrava along with his relatives.
292. The inner palaces were also lamenting with a heart-wrenching cry,
proclaiming that even in the presence of sons like you, they had achieved
suffering. 293. The father was thus creating a great obfuscation before them,
exclaiming, "O sons! In this great forest, the mlecchas are killing me, so
protect me!" 294. They demonstrated that your mother was being beaten by
chandālas, bound in chains, dragged by her locks, and she was shedding a stream
of tears. 295. The mother said, "O sons! Behold the state I am in the forest.
Not only this, but the Shabara people are taking me to their settlement right
before you!" 296. "You had previously claimed falsely that even those empowered
by knowledge..."

160 It has been said in the Papouraana that even one Mlechchha is too much, but
now you three are so weak that you are not even enough for one Mlechchha.
||297-298|| O Dashagreva, Vibhishana was praising you in vain, because you are
not even able to protect your own mother. Then I understand that you do not have
even one head. ||299|| You have been devoid of any sense of honour for as long
as you have been in my womb and have come out. It would have been better if I
had carried even excrement for that long. ||300|| It seems that this Bhanukarna
is also devoid of ears, because I am shouting and he is not listening to my
sorrowful words. Look, how he has become motionless. ||301|| This Vibhishana is
also carrying this name Vibhishana in vain, and he has become so inactive like a
corpse that he is not even able to defeat one Mlechchha. ||302|| Look, these
Mlechchhas are making my sister Chandranakha irreligious, why don't you show any
compassion towards her? A brother's love for his sister is greater than that of
parents, but where is your concern for this? ||303|| O sons! Vidya is attained
for the prosperity of one's own people, so parents are superior to those people,
and a sister is superior to parents. This is the eternal order. ||304|| Just as
trees are burnt to ashes by the sight of a venomous snake, so too can these
Mlechchhas be burnt to ashes by the mere movement of your eyebrows. ||305|| I
carried you all in my womb out of a desire for happiness, because sons are those
who carry their parents like a palanquin - they protect them. ||306|| Even after
doing all this, when their attention did not waver, those gods started doing a
very terrible work of illusion. ||307|| They cut off the heads of their parents
in front of them with the edge of a sword, and they cut off the heads of
Ravana's other two brothers in front of Ravana. ||308|| Similarly, they cut off
Ravana's head in front of those two brothers. Due to this act, Vibhishana and
Bhanukarna became slightly agitated in their meditation due to anger. ||309||
But Dashagreva, holding onto the purity of his emotions, remained steady like
Mount Meru. He was mighty and steadfast in his faith. ||310|| He restrained the
movement of his senses within himself, and made his mind, which was as fickle as
lightning, obedient like a servant. 1. Avavady Kh. !

## Seventh Chapter  **161**  Then, with the thorn of desire and the armor of
conquered senses protecting him, Dashaanan, free from the defects of meditation,
diligently meditated on the mantra. ||312||  If a great soul desires to enter
meditation, then, for protection, he should immediately sever the eight karmas.
||313||  Meanwhile, thousands of embodied Vidyaas, with folded hands, stood
before Dashaanan, becoming his. ||314||  Before the count of mantra recitations
was complete, all the Vidyaas became his. This is certain, for what cannot be
attained with firm determination? ||315||  Firm determination is also attained
through the brilliance of past karma. Indeed, it is karma that creates obstacles
and experiences of suffering. ||316||  A being without virtue cannot attain the
three jewels, the fruit of right knowledge, the knowledge of names, or the three
treasures, even if he gives charity at the right time, to the right recipient,
and in the right place, or if his lifespan is about to end. ||317||  For some,
Vidyaas are attained in ten years, for some in a month, and for some in a
moment, all due to the influence of karma. ||318||  Even if a being sleeps on
the earth, renounces food for a long time, immerses himself in water day and
night, falls from the top of a mountain, and even dies, he cannot achieve his
desires if he is devoid of virtue. ||319-320||  Those who have performed good
deeds in past lives attain Siddhi effortlessly. Practices like austerities are
merely instruments. But those who have not performed good deeds in past lives
die in vain, their lives are meaningless. ||319-320||  Therefore, a human being
should serve the Acharya with utmost respect and always accumulate virtue, for
how can Siddhi be attained without virtue? ||322||  Gautama Swami says, "O
Shrenik! See the power of virtue! Even though Dashaanan, with his great mind,
did not have the full time, he still attained the Siddhi of Vidyaas." ||323||
Now, I will briefly mention the names of the Vidyaas. These names are derived
from their meaning and power, and are commonly used. O Shrenik! Listen with an
attentive mind. ||324||  Sंचारिणी, कामदायिनी, कामगामिनी, दुर्निवारा, जगत्कम्पा,
प्रज्ञप्ति, भानुमालिनी. ||325||

## Seventh Chapter  163. "O great one, I am very pleased with your valor.
Therefore, dwell in this Jambudvipa, which is surrounded by four oceans, east,
west, north, and south, and is filled with Nagakumara and Vyantara Devas, as you
please." (342) "I am the lord of this entire island, and I have no rival.
Therefore, I grant you the boon to roam freely in this Jambudvipa, as you wish,
vanquishing your enemies." (343) "O dear one, I am pleased with you, and I will
always be present in your memory. Even Indra would not be able to hinder your
desires under my influence, let alone ordinary mortals." (344) "May you live a
long life, filled with happiness, along with your brothers. May your divine
powers always increase, and may your relatives always serve them." (345)   With
these heartfelt blessings, the Yaksha, accompanied by his family, returned to
his abode. (346)  Hearing of Ratnashrava, whose form was adorned with knowledge,
groups of Rakshasas, filled with joy, approached him from all sides. (347) Some
danced, some played instruments, and some were so overwhelmed with joy that they
could not contain themselves. (348) Some roared loudly, terrifying the enemy,
while others laughed for a long time, smearing the sky with lime. (349) Sumali,
Malyavan, Suryaraj, and Riksharaj, filled with joy, arrived in their magnificent
chariots. (350) All their relatives, some in flying vehicles, some on horses,
and some on elephants, came from their respective lands, free from fear. (351)
Then, Ratnashrava, whose heart was filled with love for his son, arrived,
continuously making the sky white with flags, adorned with great power. Groups
of captives praised him, and he was riding in a chariot as beautiful as a grand
palace. (352-353)  As they all traveled together, they spent the night on a
mountain called Panchasangama, filled with sorrow due to the fear of their
enemies. (354)  Then, the sons of Kekasi, with reverence, greeted their elders
and friends, and with affectionate eyes, they welcomed their servants. (355)

---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, there is a story about the questioning of the well-being of
the body and the attainment of Siddhi. It is not considered inappropriate to
repeatedly ask about such matters when they are relevant.  ||356|| The Rakshasas
and Vanaras, filled with wonder, beheld the self-illuminated city, which was
like the celestial realm. ||357|| Their parents, their eyes filled with joy,
touched the bodies of Dasanana and the others with trembling hands, offering
their salutations. ||358|| When the sun was in the middle of the sky, the divine
women began the bathing ceremony of the three Kumaras with great festivity.
||359|| They were seated on bathing platforms adorned with pearls and rich with
various jewels, made of pure gold. ||360|| Their feet, with their reddish hue
like the tender leaves, were placed on footrests, making them appear like the
rising sun on the peak of Mount Meru. ||361|| Then, they were bathed with
pitchers made of jewels, gold, and silver, their mouths covered with leaves,
adorned with garlands, their forms veiled by a radiance that rivaled the moon
and the sun, filled with fragrant water that perfumed the entire sky, with one
main mouth and many smaller ones, around which swarms of bees hovered, and which
roared like thunderous clouds due to the cascading water. ||362-364|| Then, they
were anointed with fragrant water and other substances that enhanced their
radiance, accompanied by the auspicious sounds of trumpets and other
instruments. ||365|| Afterwards, their bodies were adorned with divine garments
and ornaments, and the women of the clan performed various auspicious rituals
with great respect. ||366|| Then, the three Kumaras, who resembled divine
princes and brought joy to their loved ones, respectfully offered their
salutations to their teachers. ||367|| Seeing the wealth of knowledge they had
attained, the teachers blessed them, saying, "May you live long and prosper."

The Seventh Chapter  Sumali, Malyaavan, Suryaraj, Riksharaj and Ratnashrava
embraced them again and again out of affection. ||369||  They all, surrounded by
their relatives and servants, who had all the desired wealth, ate together.
||370||  Then Dashaanan worshipped the gurus by giving them clothes and other
things, and also honored the servants as per their worth. ||371||  The gurus,
whose eyes were filled with joy, were reassured.  They asked them, "O sons, have
you all been well for so many days?" ||372||  Then Dashaanan and the other
princes, joining their hands and bowing their heads, said, "By your grace, we
are all well." ||373||  Then, in the course of the conversation, the death of
Mali was mentioned, and Sumali was so grief-stricken that he fainted
immediately. ||374||  Then Dashaanan, the eldest son of Ratnashrava, touched him
with his cool hand and brought him back to consciousness. ||375||  He also
cheered him up with words as cool as ice and as powerful as the sprouting of
seeds that would destroy all enemies. ||376||  Seeing Dashaanan, whose eyes were
like lotuses, Sumali immediately forgot his grief and was filled with joy again.
||377||  He then spoke to Dashaanan with heartfelt words, "O son, your noble
character is truly pleasing to the gods. ||378||  O, your radiance surpasses the
sun.  Your dignity surpasses the ocean. ||379||  O, your prowess, combined with
your beauty, is unmatched.  O son, you are a special jewel of the Rakshasa clan.
||380||  Just as Jambudvipa is adorned by Mount Sumeru, and the sky is adorned
by the moon and the sun, so too is this Rakshasa clan adorned by you, O son,
whose actions are a wonder to the world. ||381-382||  Your ancestors, like
Meghavahan, ruled Lanka and then attained liberation after performing
austerities. ||383||

166 You have been born now by the merit of the severance of our vices. How can I
describe the joy I feel, O son, with just one mouth? ||384|| These celestial
beings had given up hope of life, but now, with your birth, they have renewed
their hope. ||385|| Once, we went to Mount Kailasa to worship the Jina. There,
we bowed to the supreme sage, the possessor of omniscience, and asked, "O Lord,
when will we again reside in Lanka?" The compassionate sage replied, ||386-387||
"The son born to you from the daughter of Viyabindu will be the one who will
bring you back to Lanka." ||388|| That son will be endowed with strength and
valor, and will be the sole refuge of virtue, prowess, humility, wealth, fame,
and beauty. He will rule over three parts of the Bharata land. ||389|| He will
also liberate the wealth that has been seized by the enemy. This is not
surprising, for he will attain supreme wealth in Lanka. ||390|| So, you have
been born as a cause for celebration for the family, and all your signs are
auspicious. You have captivated everyone's eyes with your incomparable form.
||391|| Upon hearing this, Dasanana bowed his head in shame, and said, "So be
it," and folded his hands and touched his head, paying homage to the Siddha.
||392|| Thereafter, due to the influence of that child, all the relatives lived
happily in their respective places, free from fear of enemies. ||393|| Then,
Gautama Swami said to King Shrenik, "O King, in this way, men attain wealth
through fame, which spreads throughout the world, due to the influence of their
past good deeds. Age is not the cause of this. Does not a single spark of fire
instantly burn a vast forest? Does not a lion cub tear apart a herd of maddened
elephants? ||394|| A single ray of the moon quickly brings coolness to the lotus
flowers, and the rays of the sun dispel the heat generated in living beings.

## The Eighth Chapter  Now, in the southern range of the Vijayardha mountain,
there was a city called Asura-Sangita. There lived a powerful warrior named
Maya, a Vidyadhara, whose brilliance was like that of the sun. He was known as a
Daitya in the world. He had a wife named Hemavati, who possessed all the virtues
of womanhood.    They had a daughter named Mandodari, whose every limb was
beautiful. She had a slender waist, large eyes, and a beauty that flowed like a
stream of water.   One day, seeing his daughter, now fully blossomed with youth,
the father was overwhelmed with worry and spoke to his wife with great respect,
saying, "My dear, our daughter Mandodari has reached the age of youth. Seeing
this, my anxiety about this matter has multiplied."  Someone has rightly said
that at the onset of a girl's youth, which ignites the fire of anxiety, parents,
along with other relatives, become fuel for that fire.   Therefore, wise men,
with hearts filled with sorrow, offer water with their eyes as an offering to a
daughter at her birth.   Alas, the separation from a child born from one's own
body, taken away by strangers, pierces the heart.   Therefore, my dear, tell me,
to whom shall we give this young girl? Who, with his virtues, lineage, and
beauty, would be a suitable match for her?  Hearing this, Queen Hemavati said,
"Mothers are suitable for protecting the bodies of their daughters, while
fathers are suitable for giving them away."  "Where you find it pleasing to give
her away, it is pleasing to me as well. Daughters of noble families follow the
wishes of their husbands."  Hearing this, the king, along with his ministers,
began to deliberate. One minister suggested a certain Vidyadhara.   Then,
another minister suggested Indra, the lord of all Vidyadharas. All Vidyadharas
fear him, for he is invincible.

## The Eighth Chapter  169  Then, King Maya himself said, "I do not know the
minds of you all. But I am pleased with the renowned Dashaanan, who has mastered
all the Vidyaas." 14  "He is destined to be a great one, a cause of wonder in
the world. Otherwise, how could he have mastered so many Vidyaas at such a young
age?" 15  Hearing this, all the ministers, led by Maricha, who were experts in
Mantras, were filled with joy. 16  Maricha and his powerful brothers, along with
the other ministers, urged King Maya to act quickly. 17  King Maya, considering
that time was slipping away, decided to act. He chose a favorable day, when the
auspicious planets were in the ascendant, the inauspicious planets were in the
opposite direction, and the ascendant was auspicious. He then set out with his
daughter in the Pushpantak Vimana. As they departed, the sound of trumpets
filled the air, and the women sang auspicious songs. When the trumpets fell
silent, the sky echoed with the women's songs, as if it were filled with sound
itself. 18-20  "Dashaanan is in the Bhimavana," reported the young men who had
gone ahead, returning to King Maya after disembarking from the Pushpantak
Vimana. 1  King Maya, after consulting with the local spies, set out for the
Bhimavana. There, he saw the forest, dark as a black cloud. 21-22  One of the
spies, pointing out the specific location of Dashaanan, said, "O King! Just as
there is the Mandaruna forest between the Sammedachala and Kailasa mountains, so
too is this excellent forest between the Valahka and Sandhyavarta mountains. See
how beautiful this forest is, like a mass of soft darkness, with its tall, dense
trees." 23-24  "In the middle of this forest, you can see a city adorned with
large, white houses like conch shells. It is as beautiful as a cluster of autumn
clouds." 25  "Near this city, you can see a very tall palace. It is so
magnificent that it seems to touch the sky with its peaks." 26  1.  Maricha and
his brothers. 2.  The sound of the trumpets ceased, and the sky was filled with
sound. 3.  The young men who had gone ahead. 4.  Between the Valahka and
Sandhyavarta mountains.

170 Padmapurana Having descended from the sky, the army of King Maya rested near
the palace as was appropriate. ||27|| Abandoning the pomp of trumpets and other
instruments, the king of the demons, Maya, approached the palace, adorned with
the attire of a refined man, accompanied by a few close associates. ||28||
Seeing the palace, Maya's pride vanished and he was filled with wonder. He was
announced by the gatekeeper and ascended the palace. ||29|| He reached the
seventh floor, step by step, with careful steps. There he saw a beautiful
maiden, like a forest goddess in human form. ||30|| She was Chandranakha, the
sister of Dashaanan, and she performed the rites of welcome. It is only right
that those who are well-versed in their lineage do not fail in proper
hospitality. ||31|| Then, seated comfortably, Maya asked the maiden, who was
seated on a seat fit for a princess, with humility and respect: ||32||
"Daughter, who are you? Why do you reside in this terrifying forest? And whose
is this grand palace?" ||33|| "How do you endure being alone in this palace?
Your beautiful body is not fit for suffering." ||34|| Asked thus, the young
girl, with the natural shyness of women, lowered her head, like a timid deer in
the forest, and spoke softly: ||35|| "My brother, Dashaanan, has gone to Mount
Meru to worship the Jina, having perfected this Chandrahas sword through the
sixth vow (tela). He has entrusted me with the protection of this sword. So, O
noble one, I reside in this temple adorned by the radiance of Chandra Prabha. If
you have come to see Dashaanan, please rest here for a moment." ||36-38|| While
this sweet conversation was taking place, a circle of light appeared in the sky.
||39|| At that moment, the maiden said, "It seems that Dashaanan, the ten-headed
one, has arrived, making the sky radiant with his thousand rays." ||40||
Soudharma heaven is what he desires. ||26||

## The Eighth Chapter  171  Seeing him approaching, like a mass of clouds
accompanied by lightning, Maya, filled with anxiety, rose from his seat. ||41||
Having performed the appropriate rituals, they sat down again on their seats.
Their bodies were darkened by the brilliance of their swords. ||42||  Marichi,
Vajramadhya, Vajra-netra, Nabhastaddit, Ugra-nak, Marud-vaktra, Medhavi, Sarasa,
and Shuka, and others like them, having seen Dasha-nan, were filled with great
joy. They spoke these auspicious words to Maya, the minister of the Daitya king:
||43-44||  "O Daitya king, your wisdom is superior to all others. It is because
of you that this best of men has been placed in our hearts." ||45||  They said
to Dasha-griva, "Oh, how brilliant your form is! Oh, how great is your humility
and your strength!" ||46||  "This Daitya king, known as Maya throughout the
world, resides in the city of Asarasangeet in the southern region. He has been
attracted by your virtues, O Kumar. Who would not be eager to see you?"
||47-48||  Then Ratna-shrava's son, Dasha-nan, said, "Welcome! The wise say that
sweet speech is the family knowledge of the virtuous." ||49||  "The Daitya king,
a noble man, has shown us his love. I wish that he would bestow his favor on
these people with appropriate orders." ||50||  Then Maya said, "Father, it is
right for you to say this. The virtuous never engage in harmful conduct." ||51||
Seeing Dasha-nan, Maya's ministers, whose minds were filled with curiosity, were
filled with joy and spoke to him again with words full of affection. ||52||
Then, with good intentions, Dasha-nan entered the beautiful inner sanctum of the
Chandra-prabha Jinalaya. There he performed great worship, especially to the
Jina-endras. ||53||  He recited various hymns that caused the hair to stand on
end. He folded his hands and placed them on his head, which was adorned with a
jewel. ||54||

In the Padma Purana,  He touched the ground with his forehead and knees, and
bowed low to the feet of the Jinas for a long time. || 55 || Then, the one who
had attained the highest liberation, left the Jina's house, accompanied by the
king of the Daityas, and sat down comfortably on a seat. || 56 || While
inquiring about the news of the celestial beings who lived on the Vijayardha
mountain, he saw Mandodari. || 57 || She was adorned with beautiful features,
and her body was like a land of jewels of good fortune. Her feet were small, but
her nails were long and smooth. || 58 || Her thighs were like the trunks of
banana trees, or like the quiver of Kamadeva, or like streams of beauty. || 59
|| Her hips were well-proportioned, high, and like the assembly hall of
Kamadeva, and they were adorned with a beautiful curve. || 60 || Her waist was
strong like a thunderbolt, and her breasts were like golden pots. Her face was
downcast in shyness, and her arms were soft like garlands of Shirisha flowers.
|| 61 || Her neck was adorned with lines like a conch shell, and it was slightly
bent. Her face was like the full moon, and her nose was like a bridge built
across a river of the brilliance of her eyes. || 62 || Her cheeks were adorned
with the red hue of her teeth, and her voice was like the sound of a vina, a
bumblebee, and a cuckoo in ecstasy. || 63 || Her eyes were like the messengers
of Kamadeva, and she seemed to scatter blue lotuses, red lotuses, and white
lotuses in all directions. || 64 || Her forehead was like the moon on the eighth
day, her ears were beautiful, and her hair was smooth, black, and fine. || 65 ||
She was conquering the lotus flower with the beauty of her face and feet, the
elephant with the beauty of her hands, and the swan and the lioness with her
grace and movement. || 66 || The knowledge had embraced Dashaanan, and I
remained like this, filled with envy, as if Lakshmi had left her lotus abode and
come in the form of Mandodari. || 67 ||

## The Eighth Chapter  173  A creation, unprecedented, devoid of any flaws, was
brought forth by Karma, as if gathering all the beauty of the world. ||68||
She, like a radiant light, had come to earth, abandoning the Moon, fearing the
touch of the Sun's rays and the fear of Rahu's attack. ||69||  The cluster of
gems adorning her forehead served as a veil for her face, and the necklace she
wore was like a bridge over the stream of her facial beauty. ||70||  She wore
earrings adorned with pearls, which seemed like a garland of white sandalwood.
||71||  Her hips, unable to bear the agitation caused by the pride of Kama, were
adorned with a girdle studded with gems. ||72||  Seeing her, so beautiful,
Dashaanan was filled with sorrow and thought, "Even those with fortitude are
often subdued by worldly desires." ||73||  His gaze, falling upon her, filled
with sweetness, became intoxicated, as if drunk with honey, even when withdrawn.
||74||  He wondered, "Who is this supreme woman? Is she Hri, Sri, Lakshmi,
Dhriti, Kirti, or Saraswati?" ||75||  "Is she married or unmarried? Or is this
some illusion created by someone? Oh, this is the most excellent creation, the
crown jewel of all women!" ||76||  "If I could obtain this woman, who steals the
senses, my birth would be fulfilled. Otherwise, it is as worthless as a blade of
grass." ||77||  Thinking thus, May, the knower of intentions, brought his
daughter Mandodari before Dashaanan and said, "She is yours." ||78||  Dashaanan,
drenched by these words, as if by nectar, felt a surge of joy, his body tingling
with delight. ||79||  Then, in a moment, all things came together, and the
wedding ceremony of these two, filled with the joy of their families, was
completed. ||80||  Then, Dashaanan, his purpose fulfilled, went to his city,
Swayamprabha, with Mandodari, believing he had obtained the fortune that resided
in all the worlds. ||81||  Karma, the creator, had gathered all the beauty of
the world and, under the guise of a woman, had created this unprecedented
creation. ||68||

In the Padma Purana, King Maya, though filled with joy at the removal of the
thorn of worry about his daughter, was also filled with sorrow at her
separation. He resided in his own abode.  ||42|| Mandodari, with her charming
demeanor, gradually became the most prominent among thousands of goddesses,
captivating the heart of the king with her virtues. ||43||  Like Indra with his
consort Indrani, Dashaanan, accompanied by Mandodari, delighted in his desired
places. ||8||  Desiring to know the power of his knowledge, Dashaanan, with his
radiant brilliance, engaged in numerous activities. ||85||  He, being one,
became many, uniting with all women.  He sometimes generated heat like the sun,
and sometimes emitted moonlight like the moon. ||86||  He sometimes emitted
flames like fire, and sometimes rained like clouds.  He sometimes moved
mountains like the wind, and sometimes exerted the power of Indra. ||87||  He
sometimes became the ocean, sometimes a mountain, sometimes a maddened elephant,
and sometimes a swift horse. ||88||  He was near in an instant, far in an
instant, visible in an instant, invisible in an instant, great in an instant,
subtle in an instant, terrifying in an instant, and not terrifying in an
instant. ||89||  Thus, while roaming, he reached a mountain called Meghrav and
saw a clear water pond there. ||90||  In that pond, there were lotus flowers,
blue lotuses, red lotuses, white lotuses, and other types of lotuses.  On its
banks, there were cranes, swans, ducks, and herons. ||91||  Its banks were
covered with soft green grass, and its steps enhanced its beauty.  Its water
seemed as if the sky had melted and filled it with the rays of the sun. ||92||
Its banks were filled with tall trees like Arjuna (a type of tree).  Whenever
groups of fish jumped up in it, water droplets flew up from them. ||93||  With
its waves, which were like fleeting moments, it seemed to be making sounds like
the chirping of birds, which were pleasing to the ears. ||94||

**Aṣṭama Parva**  175   There, among those engrossed in play, the son of Kekasī
saw the supreme prosperity of those holding six thousand maidens. ॥95॥ Some
played in the water jets flown from afar by the distant girl. "The well-formed
maidens roamed far, having fulfilled their friendships." ॥96॥ One of them, named
Padmapaṇḍa, sat there, showing her teeth while making the water lily suspicious
among her companions, lingering there for a long time. ॥97॥ Another, producing
sounds like a mṛdaṅga with a slow tempo in the water, was singing in six
measures. ॥18॥ At that moment, the young maidens saw Rātri, the son of
Ratnaśrava, and for a moment forgot their playful water games, as if they were
petrified. ॥19॥ In the middle of them was Daśagrīva, who, yearning for pleasure,
became attached to that gathering of maidens, allowing them all to indulge in
delight. ॥10॥ With arrows like flowers drawn from the flower-archers, they were
all struck equally, and thus their gazes were fixed upon that glorious son.
॥101॥ Mixed in the flavor of desire, their minds were like the swaying of a
fast-moving chariot, filled with restless excitement. ॥10॥ Among them was a
maiden of great beauty, named Padmāvatī, whose eyes resembled the buds of a
large blue lotus. ॥10॥ Another maiden named Aśokalata, the daughter of Buddha,
was born anew with the beauty of a young Aśoka flower. ॥10॥ In the evening, the
daughter of the king Kanaka, named Vidyutprabhā, was so beautiful that she made
lightning feel shy before her splendor. ॥105॥ These maidens were born of a great
lineage and were the most beautiful amongst all, seeming to embody the beauty of
the three worlds. ॥106॥ The aforementioned three maidens, along with all others,
approached Daśagrīva, as modesty persists until the pain of desire becomes
unbearable. ॥107॥ Thereafter, without any doubt, Daśagrīva encountered all those
maidens in playful pursuits, filled with joy.    (Note: Certain Sanskrit words
and phrases have been kept in their original language to preserve their
significance and context.)

176 In the Padma Purana, Dasagriva, with those women, again engaged in play.
They, being mutually attracted, became agitated at the first approach. ||109||
Indeed, that play is being performed by him, so it is fitting. The beauty of the
stars is due to the moon. ||110|| Then, the Kanchukis, having quickly gone to
them, informed the Janakas of this incident, which happened due to Ratnaśrava.
||111|| Then, those cruel men, sent by them for his destruction, with their lips
bitten and their brows furrowed, were full of anxiety. ||112|| They, all
together, released various weapons, but they were defeated by Kaitakeśaya with a
mere glance. ||113|| Then, those, with their whole bodies trembling with fear,
and their hands having released their weapons, approached the beautiful
Amarasundara. ||114|| "Take our lives, O Lord, or cut off our hands and feet, or
our necks, we are unable to destroy that man." ||115|| In the midst of the group
of women, a certain valiant man, shining with beauty, equal to that of the moon,
was seated. ||116|| Even the gods, headed by Indra, cannot bear the sight of him
when he is angry, what to speak of us, who are mere mortals? ||117|| We have
seen many excellent men, like the king of Rathnapura, Indra, etc., but this one
is the most revered of all. ||118|| Hearing this, Amarasundara, whose face was
red with great anger, went out, accompanied by Kanaka and Budha. ||119|| Other
valiant husbands of the celestial women, making the sky brilliant with the rays
of their weapons, also went out. ||120|| Then, seeing them coming, those
celestial women, whose minds were filled with fear, said to Ratnaśrava: "O Lord,
you have come to great danger on our account. In truth, we are all devoid of
merit and auspicious signs." ||121-122||  The Gandharva married in the same way
as the moon marries the group of stars. ||108||  After that, they, the women,
started playing again with Dasanana, competing with each other, saying, "I will
reach first, I will reach first." ||109|| The woman who plays with Dasanana
seems to be good, and it is right, because what is the beauty of the stars
without the moon? ||110|| After that, the Kanchukis, who had come back with
these women, quickly went and told the fathers of the women about this incident
of Dasanana. ||111|| Then, the fathers of the women sent such cruel men to
destroy Dasanana, who were biting their lips in anger and looked terrible with
their furrowed brows. ||112|| They were all releasing various kinds of weapons
together, but Dasanana defeated them with a mere glance. ||113|| Then, those
whose whole bodies were trembling with fear and whose hands had released their
weapons, went to King Surasundara and said, ||114|| "O Lord! Take our lives, or
cut off our hands and feet, or our necks, we are not able to destroy that man."
||115|| A valiant man, beautiful like Indra and shining with the beauty of the
moon, was sitting among the women. ||116|| Even the gods, headed by Indra,
cannot bear the sight of him when he is angry, what to speak of us, who are mere
mortals? ||117|| We have seen many excellent men, like the king of Rathnapura,
Indra, etc., but this one is the most revered of all. ||118|| Hearing this, King
Surasundara, whose face was red with great anger, went out, accompanied by
Kanaka and Budha. ||119|| Besides them, many other valiant husbands of the
celestial women, making the sky brilliant with the rays of their weapons, also
went out. ||120|| Then, seeing them coming, those celestial women, whose minds
were filled with fear, said to Dasanana: "O Lord! You have come to great danger
on our account. In truth, we are all devoid of merit and auspicious signs."

## The Eighth Chapter  177  Arise, O Lord, and seek refuge in someone. Be
gracious to us. Fly up to the sky quickly and protect our precious lives.
||123||  Or, remain hidden in this Jain temple until these cruel men see your
form. ||124||  Hearing these pitiful words and seeing the approaching army,
Dashaanan turned his eyes, white like the moon and red like the lotus. ||125||
He said to the maidens, "Surely you do not know our prowess, therefore you speak
thus. Consider this: what can many crows do to a Garuda, even if they gather
together?" ||126||  "A lone lion cub, with his mane flowing, does not destroy a
herd of maddened elephants?" ||127||  Hearing Dashaanan's words filled with
valor, the maidens said again, "O Lord, if you think so, then protect our
father, brothers, and relatives. Do not kill them in battle." ||128||  "My dear
ones, it shall be so. Do not fear. I will comfort you until this army arrives."
||129||  Then, mounting a chariot created by knowledge, Ravana ascended to the
sky and began to chew his lips with his teeth. ||130||  His very limbs, upon
experiencing the festival of battle, swelled so much and became so rough with
excitement that they could barely fit in the sky. ||131||  Then, just as clouds
pour down thick streams of water on a mountain, all the warriors began to hurl
weapons at Dashaanan. ||132||  Dashaanan then began to rain down stones. With
some, he blocked the enemy's weapons, and with others, he terrified the enemy
army. ||133||  "What good will it do me to kill these wretched, lowly
Vidyadharas?" Thinking this, he turned his gaze upon the three chief
Vidyadharas: Surasunder, Kanak, and Budh. ||134||  Then, with a weapon of
darkness, he blinded them, rendering them motionless. He bound them with a
serpent's noose and brought them before the three maidens. ||135||

137. Then, in the Padma Purana, there was a wedding ceremony for them, and a
great festival lasting three days, celebrating knowledge.  138. They all
departed, with his permission, to their respective homes. He, attracted by the
virtues of Mandodari, went to the city of Swayamprabha. 139. Seeing him, adorned
with great splendor, accompanied by his wives, his relatives were overjoyed,
their eyes wide with delight. 140. From afar, Bhanukarna and Vibhishana, along
with other friends and relatives, came out to greet him. 141. Surrounded by
them, he entered the magnificent city of Swayamprabha. They all enjoyed
themselves there, attaining supreme happiness. 142. In the city of Kumbhapura,
there was a beautiful daughter named Taḍinmālā, born to the king, Mahōdara. 143.
Bhanukarna, delighted, obtained her as his wife. Immersed in the ocean of love,
he enjoyed her charming and playful nature. 144. In Kumbhapura, a loud noise was
made by an enemy. Hearing the cries of his father-in-law, Bhanukarna was deeply
affected. 145. From then on, he became known in the world as Kumbhakarna. He was
a valiant warrior, devoted to righteousness, and a master of the arts. 146.
Wicked people have misrepresented him. They say he lived on flesh and blood and
slept for six months. 147. His food was pure, sweet, and prepared according to
his desire. It was fragrant and he always entertained his guests first, before
eating with his family. 148. He slept at dusk and woke at dawn. The rest of his
time was spent in religious activities. 149. Those who are devoid of the
knowledge of the Supreme Truth, and who slander the virtuous, are destined for
hell. Shame on them! 150. In the southern region, there is a city called
Jyotiprabha. There, the king, Mayamahasuhrit, is as pure as a lotus.

## The Eighth Canto  179 From his Nandana Mala, a beautiful daughter was born,
named Rajiva Sarasi, who was given to Vibhishana in marriage. ||15|| The wise
Vibhishana, with his divine form, did not find pleasure with the beautiful
Rajiva Sarasi, like a lotus with a lotus. ||152|| Then Mandodari, due to the
auspicious time, conceived. Her mind was filled with thoughts, and her desires
were fulfilled instantly. Her movements were captivating. ||153|| She was taken
to her father's house, where she gave birth to a noble son, who was known
throughout the earth as Indrajit. ||154|| Indrajit, the delight of his people,
grew up in his grandfather's house. He played like a young lion, full of joy.
||155|| Then Mandodari, with her son, was brought back to her husband. She
brought sorrow to her father, due to the separation from her son. ||156||
Dashanan, seeing his son, was filled with immense joy. There is no greater
happiness than that of a son. ||157|| In due course, Mandodari conceived again
and was sent back to her father. There, she gave birth to a son named
Meghavahana. ||158|| Then she was brought back to her husband, and she immersed
herself in the ocean of pleasure, her mind captivated by her husband. ||159||
The two boys, with their charming movements, brought joy to their family. They
reached their youth, their eyes as vast as those of a great bull. ||160|| Then
Kumbhakarna, going to the cities ruled by Vaishravana, destroyed them thousands
of times. ||161|| From those cities, the valiant Kumbhakarna brought back
beautiful jewels, clothes, women, and courtesans to his own city, Swayamprabha.
||162|| When Vaishravana, the powerful Indra, learned of Kumbhakarna's mischief,
he sent a messenger to Sumali, filled with pride. ||163|| The messenger entered
the city and was announced to the guards. He received a welcome befitting a
guest, according to the customs of the world. ||164||

180 In the Padma Purana, this was said by the messenger, known as Vakyalankara.
He spoke to Dashaanan (Ravana) in the presence of Sumali, in this order. ||165||
"O Maharaj, remember what Vaishravana (Kubera), whose fame pervades the entire
universe, has said to you." ||166|| "He said that you are a scholar, a noble, a
man of the world, a great man, afraid of wrongdoing, and a guide on the right
path." ||167|| "It is fitting for you to restrain your reckless grandson, who is
like a playful child." ||168|| "This is the main difference between animals and
humans: animals do not know the difference between right and wrong, while humans
do." ||169|| "Even when they gain some fleeting power, those with firm minds do
not forget their past." ||170|| "The entire family should find peace in the
death of the head gardener. Who would do something that would lead to the
complete destruction of their own family?" ||171|| "Why have you forgotten the
power of Indra, who destroys his enemies and whose glory is spread throughout
the ocean waves? Why are you trying to do something inappropriate?" ||172|| "You
are like a frog playing in the mouth of a snake, which is full of sharp teeth
and spews fire-like venom." ||173|| "If you are unable to control this thief-
like child, then hand him over to me today. I will take control of him myself."
||174|| "If you do not do this, then you will see your grandson in prison, bound
in chains and suffering various tortures." ||175|| "It seems you have been away
from Alankarodaya (Patalaloka) for a long time. Now you want to enter that same
den again." ||176|| "Be sure that if I or Indra become angry, you will have no
refuge on earth. Just as a bubble of water disappears with a slight breeze, so
will you." ||177|| Then, the water of Dashaanan's mind, which was like an ocean,
was agitated by the strong wind of the messenger's harsh words. ||178|| The
messenger entered after delivering the message. He was well-versed in social
etiquette and behaved with appropriate humility. ||164|| The messenger's name
was Vakyalankara. He began to speak to Dashaanan in the presence of Sumali, in
this order. ||165|| "O Maharaj, remember what Vaishravana (Kubera), whose fame
pervades the entire universe, has said to you." ||166|| "He said that you are a
scholar, a noble, a man of the world, a great man, afraid of wrongdoing, and a

something that would lead to the complete destruction of their own family?"
||171|| "Why have you forgotten the power of Indra, who destroys his enemies and
whose glory is spread throughout the ocean waves? Why are you trying to do

are unable to control this thief-like child, then hand him over to me today. I
will take control of him myself." ||174|| "If you do not do this, then you will
see your grandson in prison, bound in chains and suffering various tortures."
||175|| "It seems you have been away from Alankarodaya (Patalaloka) for a long
time. Now you want to enter that same den again." ||176|| "Be sure that if I or
Indra become angry, you will have no refuge on earth. Just as a bubble of water
disappears with a slight breeze, so will you." ||177|| Then, the water of
Dashaanan's mind, which was like an ocean, was agitated by the strong wind of
the messenger's harsh words. ||178||

## The Eighth Chapter  2  As the messenger spoke, the ocean of ten heads was
filled with agitation. || 178 ||  Hearing the messenger's words, the ten-headed
one was shaken as if someone had grabbed him and shaken him violently. Sweat
poured from every pore of his body, and his eyes, blood-red, stained the entire
sky. || 179 ||  Then, deafening the directions with his voice that echoed
through the sky, the ten-headed one, making the elephants lose their madness
with his roar, spoke. || 180 ||  "Who is this Vaishravana, or who is called
Indra, who has seized our city, inherited through generations?" || 181 ||  "This
shameless, low-born man, acting like Indra in front of his servants, is like a
crow pretending to be a hawk, and a jackal acting like a Sarabha." || 182 ||
"Oh, messenger! You speak harsh words in front of us without fear. I will offer
your head as a sacrifice to my anger." || 183 ||  Saying this, he drew his sword
from its sheath, making the sky, like a vast lake, appear as if it were filled
with a forest of blue lotuses. || 184 ||  His sword, making a humming sound,
trembled as if from the wind's anger, appearing as if Yama himself had come in
the form of a sword, or as if it were the son of violence. || 185 ||  The ten-
headed one had just raised his sword when Vibhishana intervened, calming him
with great respect. || 186 ||  "What is the fault of this servant, this
wretched, degraded soul, who has sold his body and repeats whatever he is told,
like a parrot?" || 187 ||  "The messengers speak whatever they do, driven by
their master, who resides in their hearts, like a demon. In reality, the
messengers are like puppets, controlled by others." || 188 ||  "Therefore, O
noble one, be pleased and show mercy to the suffering creature. By killing a
small being, the earth will be filled with infamy in the world." || 189 ||
"Your sword will fall only on the heads of your enemies, for Garuda does not
attack the non-poisonous snakes that live in water." || 190 ||  Thus, the fire
of anger in the ten-headed one was quelled by the water of good counsel from
Vibhishana, the righteous speaker, until others pulled the messenger's feet and
quickly dragged him out of the assembly hall.  The Acharya says:  1.

##  English Translation:  182 In the Padma Purana, the messenger, having been
treated well by others, was dragged by his feet. He was quickly expelled from
the house. Shame on the servant who created this sorrow!  ||192||  Going to
Vaishravana, he informed him of this situation. He also told him of the harsh
words spoken by Dashagriva. ||193||  Fueled by this information, Vaishravana's
anger ignited like a fire.  He, like a minister, shared this anger with his
servants. ||194||  He declared war with a harsh sound of the trumpet.  Mani-
bhadra and others were immediately prepared for battle. ||195||  Vaishravana,
surrounded by Yaksha warriors wielding shining swords, spears, and chakra,
marched forth. ||196||  He was accompanied by elephants resembling the size of
Anjan mountain, chariots resembling the color of the evening sky, horses with
waving chamaras, and swift winds of victory.  His celestial vehicles, resembling
the abode of the gods, soared high in the sky. ||197||  He was also accompanied
by infantry, whose strength was like a rushing torrent, surpassing even the
horses, chariots, elephants, and celestial vehicles. ||198||  Meanwhile,
Dashagriva, the mighty one, had already emerged with his brothers, Bhanukarna
and others, ready for the great battle. ||199||  The two armies clashed on the
peak of the mountain called Gunja.  The clash of weapons created a fiery blaze.
||201||  The sound of clashing swords, the neighing of horses, the roar of the
infantry, the trumpeting of elephants, the beautiful sound of chariots
colliding, the loud sound of the trumpets, and the whistling of arrows, all
combined to create a unique and mixed sound.  The echo reverberated between the
sky and the earth, filling the warriors with a supreme intoxication. ||202-204||
The warriors wielded swords resembling the jaws of Yama, spears resembling the
teeth of Yama, arrows resembling the threats of Yama, shields resembling the
arms of Yama, and maces resembling the fists of Yama. ||205-206||  Shame on such
a servant who created this situation! ||191-192||  The messenger went and
informed Vaishravana of this situation and also told him about the harsh words
spoken by Dashagriva. ||193||  Fueled by this information, Vaishravana's anger
ignited like a fire.  He, like a minister, shared this anger with his servants.

## The Eighth Chapter  A great battle ensued, filled with valor and courage. The
cowardly were struck with fear, while the brave sought glory by sacrificing
their lives. ||207|| Seeing his army demoralized by the Yakshas, Dashaanan
(Ravana) took charge, determined to hold the battlefield. ||208|| As he
approached, his white umbrella shielded him from the sun, making him appear like
a dark cloud with the moon shining upon it. His bow, adorned with Indra's
rainbow, resembled a dark cloud charged with lightning. His crown, adorned with
countless jewels, made him look like a thunderous cloud, veiled in brilliance.
||209-211|| The Yakshas, their eyes wide with fear, lost their strength and
turned away, their resolve crumbling in an instant. ||212|| The Yaksha foot
soldiers, their hearts filled with terror, began to flee in disarray, creating a
deafening roar. Many Yaksha leaders rushed to the front of their armies,
rallying their troops to face the enemy once more. ||213-214|| Dashaanan, like a
lion leaping through the sky to destroy enraged elephants, set out to destroy
the Yaksha leaders. ||215|| Fueled by the wind of his anger, the fire of
Dashaanan's weapons blazed through the forest of the enemy army. ||216|| There
was not a single man left on earth, in a chariot, on a horse, an elephant, or in
a flying machine, who had not been pierced by Ravana's arrows. ||217|| Seeing
Dashaanan approaching, Vaishravana (Kubera) was instantly filled with brotherly
love. ||218|| He was overcome with sorrow and despair, just as the mighty Bhallu
(Bhima) had been in the past, when he had engaged in the act of peace. ||219||

184 The world, full of suffering and misery, is indeed despicable.  Living
beings are constantly reborn in different wombs, like a wheel turning.  ||220||
"Look, blinded by wealth, what have I started?  I am destroying my own brother
out of pride." ||221||  "Oh, Dashaanan, listen to these noble words.  What sin
are you committing, driven by fleeting worldly glory?" ||222||  "I am your
maternal uncle's son, and I love you like a brother.  It is not right to behave
so badly towards your own kin." ||223||  "A being who kills other beings, driven
by the desire for pleasurable objects, goes to a terrible hell, filled with
immense suffering." ||224||  "Just as a man who gains a kingdom for a day, but
dies as a result a year later, similarly, this being enjoys fleeting pleasures,
but suffers for an immeasurable time." ||225||  "Life is truly fleeting, like
the blink of an eye.  Don't you know, Dashaanan, why you are doing this, for the
sake of fleeting pleasures?" ||226||  Dashaanan, devoid of compassion, laughed
and said, "Vaishravaan, this is not the time to listen to Dharma." ||227||  "Men
mounted on intoxicated elephants, with swords in their hands, kill their
enemies, not preach Dharma." ||228||  "Why are you talking so much?  Either
stand in the path of my sword, or bow down to me.  There is no third option for
you." ||229||  "Or, since you are the guardian of wealth, protect my wealth.  A
man is not ashamed to do his own duty." ||230||  Vaishravaan then said to
Dashaanan, "Surely your lifespan is short, that's why you are speaking like
this." ||231||  Dashaanan, his mind filled with anger, replied, "If you have the
strength, then kill me." ||232||  Vaishravaan then said, "You are the elder, so
kill me first.  The strength of brave men with unblemished bodies does not
increase." ||233||

## Eighth Chapter  Then, Vaishravana released his arrows towards the ten-headed
one. The lord of the luminaries, like the sun showering its rays upon the earth
at noon, aimed his arrows at the head of the ten-headed one. ||234|| The ten-
headed one then cut those arrows with his own arrows. He created a canopy of
arrows, dense and impenetrable, in a moment, without any fear. ||235||
Vaishravana, seizing the opportunity, struck the ten-headed one's bow with his
crescent-shaped arrow, causing him to fall from his chariot. ||236|| Then, the
ten-headed one, with his indomitable spirit, mounted another chariot, which
roared like a cloud, and swiftly approached Vaishravana, his chariot shining
like the Pushpaka. ||237|| With great anger, he rained down thunderbolts, shaped
like meteors, upon Vaishravana, shattering his armor into pieces. ||238|| The
one with the white garland, with his swift Bhindimala, struck Vaishravana's
heart, causing him to faint. ||239|| A great cry arose in Vaishravana's army,
while the Rakshasa army rejoiced with loud cheers. ||240|| Vaishravana, greatly
distressed, was lifted by his servants and placed on a hero's bed. He was then
swiftly taken to Yakshapura. ||241|| Ravana, seeing his enemy defeated, withdrew
from the battle. For the victory of heroes lies in the defeat of their enemies,
not in the acquisition of wealth. ||242|| Then, Vaishravana's physicians treated
him, and he regained his former health. As he regained consciousness, he thought
to himself, ||243|| "I am now like a tree without flowers, a broken pot, or a
lotus-less pond." ||244|| "As long as a man possesses honor, he enjoys happiness
in this world while alive. Now, my honor is lost, so I strive for liberation."
||245|| "The wise do not desire worldly pleasures, for they are impermanent,
fleeting, full of obstacles, and filled with sorrow." ||246|| "This is not
anyone's fault, but the result of the actions performed by living beings in
their previous births." ||247||

186 In the Padma Purana, wise ones who know the state of the world do not get
angry at others, for they are merely the cause of their happiness or suffering.
||24||  The son of Kekasi has become my friend, who has freed me from the great
bondage of household life. ||249|| Bhanukarna is also my well-wisher now, who
has caused the war that has led to my supreme detachment. ||250|| Thinking thus,
he took the Digambara initiation and, by proper worship of the austerities,
attained the supreme abode. ||251|| Having washed away the stain of defeat upon
his family, Dashaanan (Ravana) lived happily on earth, and all his relatives
considered him their leader. ||252|| Then the beautiful Dhanada (Kubera)'s
Pushpaka Vimana was brought to Ravana by his servants. That Pushpaka Vimana was
very beautiful, Dhanada was its owner, its peak was studded with various kinds
of jewels, its windows were its eyes, the garland of pearls that was attached to
it emitted a group of pure radiance, and it seemed as if it were constantly
shedding tears due to the separation from its owner. Its front part was made of
Padmaraga gems, so when he wore it, it seemed as if he had beaten his heart a
lot due to grief, which is why he was wearing a very red hue. In some places,
the radiance of Indranila gems was covering it, which made it seem as if he had
attained a very dark complexion due to grief. It seemed like a city, being
accompanied by Chaitya temples, forests, the front parts of houses, wells, and
palaces. Various weapons had inflicted wounds on that Vimana, it was very high,
it seemed like a divine abode, and it was like an ornament of the sky.
||253-258|| Dashaanan wanted to keep that Pushpaka Vimana with him, considering
it a sign of the defeat of his enemies, otherwise, what vehicle made by
knowledge did he not have? ||259|| He mounted that Vimana, along with his
ministers, vehicles, citizens, sons, parents, and relatives. ||260|| All efforts
are... ||245|| Suffering or happiness are merely causes for others, therefore,
wise ones who know the state of the world do not get angry at them, meaning they
do not experience joy or sorrow towards the cause. ||248|| He, the ten-headed
one, is my well-wisher, who has freed me, the foolish one, from the great
bondage of household life. ||249|| Bhanukarna is also my well-wisher now, who
has caused the war that has led to my supreme detachment. ||250|| Thinking thus,
he took the Digambara initiation and, by proper worship of the austerities,
attained the supreme abode. ||251|| _Here, Dashaanan also washed away the stain
of defeat upon his family and lived happily on earth, and all his relatives
considered him their leader. ||252|| Then the beautiful Dhanada (Kubera)'s
Pushpaka Vimana was brought to Ravana by his servants. That Pushpaka Vimana was
very beautiful, Dhanada was its owner, its peak was studded with various kinds
of jewels, its windows were its eyes, the garland of pearls that was attached to
it emitted a group of pure radiance, and it seemed as if it were constantly
shedding tears due to the separation from its owner. Its front part was made of
Padmaraga gems, so when he wore it, it seemed as if he had beaten his heart a
lot due to grief, which is why he was wearing a very red hue. In some places,
the radiance of Indranila gems was covering it, which made it seem as if he had
attained a very dark complexion due to grief. It seemed like a city, being
accompanied by Chaitya temples, forests, the front parts of houses, wells, and
palaces. Various weapons had inflicted wounds on that Vimana, it was very high,
it seemed like a divine abode, and it was like an ornament of the sky.
||253-258|| Dashaanan wanted to keep that Pushpaka Vimana with him, considering

The Eighth Chapter  187.  He was happy, situated in the midst of the Mahapadma
Khanda, the inner palace. His movement was unimpeded, adorned with gestures of
his own making. ||26||  262.  With his hands holding a bow, trident, sword,
spear, and noose, he was followed by servants who had performed wondrous deeds.
||262||  263.  He was surrounded by vassals who had destroyed the armies of his
enemies, who stood in a circular formation, whose minds were inclined towards
virtue, and who were adorned with great splendor. ||263||  264.  He was fanned
by beautiful chamaras held by the hands of the best Vidyaadharis, his body
smeared with sandalwood paste and other fragrant substances. ||264||  265.  He
was adorned with a magnificent umbrella, shining like the moon, as if he were
adorned by the glory born from the defeat of his enemies. ||265||  266.  He
possessed a radiant brilliance like the sun, and was receiving the fruits of his
virtuous deeds. He was equal in glory to Indra, and was proceeding towards the
southern ocean. ||266||  267.  Kumbhakarna, mounted on an elephant, and
Vibhishana, mounted on a chariot, both filled with pride and splendor, followed
him. ||267||  268.  The great demon Maya, along with his brothers and vassals,
also followed him, riding in chariots drawn by lions, tigers, and other animals.
||268||  269.  Maricha, Ambaravidyut, Vana, Vajrodara, Budha, Vajraksha,
Kruranakra, Saran, and Sunaya, the ministers of King Maya, and other celestial
kings adorned with great splendor, followed him. ||269-270||  271.  Having
subdued the entire southern region, he then proceeded towards other directions,
observing the earth with its forests, mountains, and oceans. ||271||  272.
Then, one day, Dashaanan, whose body was bent in humility, ascended high into
the sky and asked his grandfather, Sumali, in astonishment, "O venerable one!
There is no lake on the peak of this mountain, but a forest of lotuses is
flourishing. Look at this great wonder!" ||272-273||  274.  "O master! How is it
that these large, colorful clouds are standing still on the earth here?" ||274||

In the Padma Purana, After saying "Salutations to the Siddhas," Sumali said to
Dasanana, "These are not lotuses, O son, nor are they clouds. || 275 || They are
adorned with white banners, with thousands of arches, and these Jina temples are
shining on the peaks of the mountains. || 276 || These were built by the
virtuous and great-souled Harishena. O son, you should bow to them and purify
your heart in an instant. || 277 || Then, standing there, Dasanana, the crusher
of Dhanada, bowed to the Jina temples and, filled with wonder, said, "O
venerable one, what was the greatness of Harishena, for which you have spoken of
him in this way?" || 278-279 || Then Sumali said, "O Dasanana, you have asked a
very good question. Now listen to the story of Harishena, the destroyer of sin.
|| 280 || In the city of Kampilya, there lived a great king named Mrigapati-
dhvaja, who was renowned throughout the world. || 281 || His queen was named
Prahva, who was adorned with the qualities of women and, by her good fortune,
had attained the position of being the most beautiful among hundreds of queens.
|| 282 || From them was born a son named Harishena, who was the embodiment of
supreme good fortune. He was endowed with sixty-four auspicious marks and was a
destroyer of evil. || 283 || Once, on the occasion of the Ashtahnika festival,
the virtuous queen Vatra desired to have a chariot of the Jina Tirthankara taken
out in procession in the city. || 284 || King Singh-dhvaja had another queen
named Mahalakshmi, who was always intoxicated with pride in her good fortune.
Mahalakshmi, filled with many evil intentions, was Vatra's co-wife, and she
raised her voice against her, saying, "First, my Brahma-ratha will go through
the streets of the city, and then the Jina-ratha built by queen Vatra can go."
|| 285-286 || Hearing this, Vatra was so grieved that it was as if a thunderbolt
had struck her heart. Filled with sorrow, she vowed, "If my chariot goes first
in the city, then I will eat again as before, otherwise not." || 287-288 ||
Saying this, she bound herself by this vow, and, deprived of all business, she
became pale and her face was like a lotus covered in mud. || 289 ||

## The Eighth Chapter  Then, she, releasing breaths and tears incessantly, her
face wilted with sorrow. Seeing her, Harishena said, "Mother, why have you begun
this inauspicious weeping, which you have never even dreamt of before? Please
stop and tell me the reason." || 290-291 ||  Hearing her words, he pondered the
reason. "What should I do? This heavy burden has come upon me. How can I tell my
father?" || 292 ||  "He is my father and she is my mother. Both are my supreme
gurus. Whom should I hate? Alas, I am caught in a great predicament." || 293 ||
Unable to bear the sight of his tearful mother, he left the palace and went to
the forest, teeming with wild animals. || 294 ||  There, he wandered fearlessly,
eating roots and fruits in the desolate forest, drinking water from the lakes.
|| 295 ||  Seeing his form, even the cruel animals were pacified for a moment.
Indeed, who does not love a noble being? || 296 ||  Even in the secluded forest,
the memory of his mother's weeping tormented him. The words she uttered with a
choked voice, all of it was a constant burden. || 297 ||  Despite the beautiful
landscapes of the forest, he found no peace. His gentle heart was constantly
restless, wandering aimlessly. || 298 ||  "Is this a forest deity?" he wondered
incessantly, his eyes fixed on the deer who watched him from afar. || 299 ||
Wandering thus, he reached the hermitage of Shatamanyu, a disciple of Angiras,
where creatures of the forest lived in peace, their animosity forgotten. || 300
||  Meanwhile, a king named Kalakalpa, mighty and fearsome, with a vast army,
besieged the city of Champa. || 301 ||  Janamejaya, the king of Champa, fought
against him, while Nagavati, his mother, along with her daughter, escaped
through a long tunnel built beforehand, and reached the hermitage of Shatamanyu.

Here is the translation of the provided text into English, while retaining the
Sanskrit words:  ---  In the **Padmapurāṇa**:  Nāmnā Nāgavati tasyā mātā
tanujāya samam |  Pūrvameva gatā deśaṁ śatamanyu-yatiśritam || 303 ||  Seeing
the beautiful and charming son of Nāgavati,  he was struck by the arrows of
Kāmadeva, which caused restlessness in his body. || 304 ||  Then, seeing her in
distress, Nāgavati said to her,  "O daughter! Be cautious; remember the words of
the great sage." || 305 ||  Previously, the sage had stated that you would be
the gem among the women of the chakkravarti. || 306 ||  Knowing this, the
ascetics, feeling quite frightened,  banished Harṣeṇa from their hermitage. ||
307 ||  Then, humiliated, Harṣeṇa, holding the maiden in his heart,  wandered
aimlessly, as though embracing the knowledge of Bhrāmari. || 308 ||  In his
heavy yearning, Harṣeṇa remained constantly sorrowful.  Neither in eating, nor
lying on a bed made of flowers and leaves,  nor in the joy of fruits, nor in
drinking the water of a lake,  nor in the village, nor in the city, nor in the
charming groves,  did he find any peace. || 309-310 ||  He saw the cluster of
lotuses as being like a forest fire,  and the rays of the moon appeared to him
like needles of diamond. || 311 ||  Rivers adorned with vast banks and holding
pure waters attracted his mind  because their banks resembled the curves of the
maiden he yearned for. || 312 ||  The scent of the ketakī flower pierced his
heart like a spear,  and the fragrant flowers of the kadamba trees pierced him
like a wheel. || 313 ||  The flowers of the kuta trees, swaying in the gentle
breeze,  constantly pierced his sensitive spots like the arrows of Kāmadeva. ||
314 ||  Harṣeṇa kept thinking that if he could acquire that gem of a woman,  he
would undoubtedly alleviate his mother's sorrow. || 315 ||  If that maiden were
obtained, he would consider himself  the sovereign of all Bharatavarṣa, for her
form is not meant for  a scanty enjoyment. || 316 ||  If I acquire her, I will
build temples on the banks of rivers,  in forests, in villages, in cities, and
on mountains. || 317 ||  If I do not see her, then being tormented by my
mother's sorrow,  my life shall be in vain. || 318 ||  ---   This translation
keeps the original essence and structure of the text while providing clarity in
English.

## The Eighth Chapter  His mind filled with sorrow, he wandered about,
forgetting his mother's grief, like a man possessed. (319) He traveled through
many lands and reached the city of Sindhu. Though in such a state, he was still
endowed with great strength and vigor. (320) As he went out to play, the women
of the city saw him and stood motionless, their eyes wide with wonder. (321) His
eyes were like lotus petals, his chest broad as the Meru mountain, his shoulders
like the tusks of an elephant, and his thighs like pillars. (322) The women,
their minds lost in wonder, could not take their eyes off him, and their desire
to see him was never satisfied. (323) Then, a wild elephant, its body covered in
dust and its eyes filled with rage, charged towards the women. (324) The
elephant's mahout shouted, "Run, women! I cannot hold the elephant back. If you
have any strength, flee!" (325) But the women, their minds fixed on the noble
Harishena, could not hear the mahout's words, nor could they flee. (326) The
mahout continued to shout, and the women, their hearts filled with fear, turned
their attention to him. (327) Trembling with fear, they sought refuge in
Harishena. Their desire to be with him had brought them this unexpected
protection. (328) Harishena, filled with compassion and his body tingling from
the touch of the beautiful women, thought to himself, (329) "On this side is a
deep river, on that side a wall, and on the other side an elephant. In this time
of danger, I must protect these creatures." (330) Just as a bull digs a mound
with its horns, not a mountain, and a man pierces a banana tree with an arrow,
not a rock, (331) so too, this world, filled with wicked deeds, overcomes the
weak. Even if one tries to help, one does not wish to be involved with the
harsh. (332)

Here is the English translation of the provided text, retaining the Sanskrit
terms:  ---  **192** In the **Padmapurana**   Those who are disabled (क्लीब) are
indeed very humble; I have shown them forgiveness (क्षमा). Although those
ascetics (तापस) were driven out, their nature was as gentle as that of deer
(सारङ्ग). Therefore, it was extremely virtuous for me to bear with them, as they
resided in the houses of gurus (गुरुगेहेषु). Truly, the forgiveness I granted
them has been exceedingly beneficial for me and has resulted in supreme bliss
(परमोदया). *[333-334]*   Then, with a harsh voice, Hariṣena said, "Hey, great
elephant driver (हस्तिपक), take the elephant away from this place!" *[335]*
Acknowledging this, the elephant driver (हस्तिपके) replied, "Indeed! Your
audacity (धृष्टता) is immense; you regard the elephant (गज) as a human and
consider yourself the elephant!" *[336]* You certainly appear to be near death,
as you carry such pride regarding the elephant, or perhaps you are under the
influence of some spirit. If you wish well for yourself, leave this place
immediately! *[337]*   Then, in a fit of anger, Hariṣena, dancing playfully,
laughed loudly, comforted the women (आँगन), and went in front of the elephant.
*[338]* After that, like a flash of lightning, he leapt into the sky and mounted
the elephant (मतङ्गज), placing his foot on its ear. *[339]* Subsequently, he
began to sport (क्रीडितुमारम्भे) playfully with the elephant, at times becoming
visible and at times disappearing. He played upon the entire body of the
elephant and then descended to the ground, continuing various playful acts with
the elephant. *[340]*   Hearing this grand din (कलकलं) through tradition, all
the people of the city emerged to witness this wonderful spectacle. *[341]* The
great women (महाङ्गनाः) sat in the windows, observing him while the maidens
(कन्यास्तत्समागमसंगत) expressed desires to engage with him. *[342]* Through
patting (आस्फालनैः), loud reprimands (महाशब्दैः), and repeated shaking of the
body, Hariṣena quickly rendered that elephant free from intoxication
(निर्मदस्तेन) in just a moment. *[343]*   The king of the city, Sindhu, who was
seated on the palace roof, observed this wonder. He was so delighted that he
sent his entire entourage to call Hariṣena. *[344]* Then, adorned with colorful
trinkets and embellished with various colored paintings, he rode on that
elephant in grand splendor.   ---   This translation aims to faithfully

## The Eighth Chapter  193  **346.**  Entering the city, Harishena, adorned with
drops of sweat like pearls, captivated the hearts of the city women with his
handsome form.  **347.**  He then married a hundred daughters of the king. Thus,
the story of Harishena spread everywhere.  **348.**  Though he received great
honor from the king, he considered a year as a night without the jewel of a
woman he had seen in the hermitage.  **349.**  He thought, "Surely, she is now
in the desolate forest, tormented like a deer, bereft of me."  **350.**  "If
this night ends even once, I will immediately rush to that young girl to show
compassion."  **351.**  Lying on that exquisitely decorated bed, he pondered
these thoughts. After a long time, he finally fell asleep with great difficulty.
**352.**  Even in his dreams, he saw the same lotus-eyed woman. Indeed, she had
become the sole object of his mind.  **353.**  Then, in an instant, Vegavati, a
skilled woman in all arts and virtues, the friend of the daughter of the king of
the sky-dwellers, carried him away.  **354.**  Awakening from his sleep and
seeing himself being carried away, he angrily said to Vegavati, "You wicked
woman! Why are you taking me away?"  **355.**  Harishena, whose eyes shone with
all their pupils and whose lips were clenched, clenched his fist to strike her,
like a thunderbolt-bearing mace.  **356.**  Seeing Harishena enraged, Vegavati,
though endowed with the power of knowledge, was frightened. She said to him, "O
long-lived one! Just as a man climbing a tree branch cuts its root, so you,
having mounted me, are destroying me."  **357.**  "O father! You will know the
truth of my words when you reach the place I am taking you. Be assured, your
body will not suffer even a bit there."  **358.**  Hearing Vegavati's words,
Harishena thought, "This woman is gentle and sweet-tongued. Her appearance
speaks of her desire to end the suffering of others."  **359.**  He had

The text appears to be a passage from the "Padma Purana," a significant work in
Jain literature. Here is the translation to English while retaining the Sanskrit
terms:  ---  194   In the "Padma Purana"   Just as this right eye of mine is
currently twitching, it is surely an indication that it will lead to a meeting
with dear ones. (360) Then, Harisheṇa asked her once again, "O auspicious one!
Tell me the precise reason and please satisfy my ears with a delightful story."
(361) In response, the swift one said, "In the excellent city known as
Sūryodaya, there resides King Śakradhanu. His wife is known as Dhī. They have a
daughter named Jayacandrā, who is possessed by pride of her qualities and
beauty, harbors hatred for men, and disregards her father's words." (362-363)
Among all the excellent men in the entire Bharat Kṣetra, I had previously shown
her the images, but none pleased her. (364) Then, I displayed your image to her,
and upon seeing it, she was pierced by the intense dart of longing and said, "If
I do not unite with this man, who is like Kamadeva, I would rather meet death
than accept any lowly man." (365-366) Seeing the immense grief that was stealing
away her heart due to his qualities, I made this difficult vow before her: "If I
do not bring this man, who captivates your heart, to you quickly, O friend! I
will enter the fire with flames." (367-368) It was only after making such a vow
that I met you due to great merit. Now, by your grace, I will surely fulfill my
vow. (369) Saying this, she reached the city of Sūryodaya. Upon arriving there,
she informed King Śakradhanu and the daughter Jayacandrā that Harisheṇa, the one
who would steal their hearts, had arrived. (370) Subsequently, the marriage was
arranged between the two—a remarkable couple who bore extraordinary appearances.
All the relatives, who were filled with wonder, congratulated them on their
marriage. (371) Having fulfilled my vow, the swift one received great respect
from both the king and the daughter, and there was no limit to her joy and fame.
(372) Considering, "This daughter has chosen a worldly man, abandoning us," ...

The eighth chapter:    The two, Ganga-Dhar and Mahi-Dhar, were filled with great
resources and desired to wage war, being tainted by insult. ||374||   Then,
Sakra-Dhanu, with his son, Su-Chapa, spoke to Hari-Shena, his heart filled with
compassion. ||375||   "Stay here, brother-in-law, I will go to fight. For your
sake, two enraged enemies, filled with sorrow, are enraged." ||376||   Smiling,
Hari-Shena replied, "How can one who is always engaged in the affairs of others
be indifferent to his own affairs?" ||377||   "Do me the honor, grant me your
command for battle. Having obtained a servant like me, why do you fight
yourself?" ||378||   Then, Ganga-Dhar, though desiring to stop him, was
prevented by his fear of ill omen.  He mounted a chariot, drawn by swift horses,
filled with various weapons, led by a valiant charioteer, and surrounded by a
circle of warriors. ||379-380||   Behind him, the Vidyadharas, riding horses and
elephants, made a great clamor, unbearable to the enemy's mind. ||381||   Then,
a great battle, arranged by valiant men, began. Seeing his army defeated, Hari-
Shena rose to fight. ||382||   Wherever his excellent chariot went, no horse, no
elephant, no man, no chariot remained. ||383||   With his arrows, he struck the
enemy's force, so that they fled in disarray, without looking back. ||384||
Some, trembling greatly, said in fear, "Ganga-Dhar and Mahi-Dhar have done a
great evil." ||385||   "This one shines in battle like the sun, a great man. He
releases arrows from his hands, many in all directions." ||386||   Seeing his
army destroyed by that great soul, Ganga-Dhar and Mahi-Dhar fled in fear.

196 Padmapurana Then, when those jewels appeared, at that very moment, due to
the rise of good karma, Harishena, the tenth Chakravarti, became famous for his
great rise. || 388 || Even though he was adorned with the supreme Lakshmi marked
by the Chakra jewel, he considered himself as insignificant as a blade of grass,
devoid of pride. || 389 || Then, leading his army, which stretched for twelve
yojanas, he humbled all his enemies and reached the hermitage of the ascetics.
|| 390 || When the ascetics realized that this was the same person they had
expelled from the hermitage, they were terrified. Finally, holding fruits in
their hands, they offered him Arghya and honored him with words filled with
blessings. || 391 || Shatamanyu's son, Janamejaya, and his mother, Nagavati,
were pleased and offered their daughter to him. || 392 || Then, according to the
rituals, their auspicious wedding took place. Obtaining this daughter, the king
Harishena considered it his rebirth. || 393 || Then, adorned with the Lakshmi of
the Chakravarti, he came to the city of Kampilya. Thirty-two thousand crowned
kings accompanied him. || 394 || With his head bowed, adorned with a crown
studded with a cluster of gems, and with folded hands, he respectfully
prostrated at his mother's feet. || 395 || Sumali says to Dasanana, "O Dasanana!
At that time, seeing such a son, Vaprā was overwhelmed with joy. She could not
contain herself, and her eyes filled with tears of joy." || 396 || Then, he
drove his magnificent chariots, shining like the sun, through the city of
Kampilya, thus fulfilling his mother's desire. || 397 || This act brought great
joy to the monks and the Shravakas, and many people embraced the Jina Dharma. ||
398 || The numerous, multi-colored, tall Jinalayas, which adorn the earth,
mountains, confluence of rivers, cities, and villages, were all built by him. ||
399 || After ruling for a long time, the noble-hearted Harishena renounced the
world and, through intense penance, attained the peak of the three worlds, the
Siddhalaya. || 400 || Hearing the story of Harishena Chakravarti, Dasanana was
filled with wonder. Then, after paying homage to the Jina, he continued on his
journey. || 401 || 1. Madanavalyā : M.  2. Vaivāha - M.

## Eighth Chapter  Then, knowing the victory of the ten-faced one, the sun, as
if out of fear, abandoned the sight of his eyes. || 402 || The entire universe
was covered with the red hue of the evening, as if filled with the immense love
born from the ten-faced one. || 403 || The twilight was gradually consumed by
darkness, as if it was meant to serve the ten-faced one. || 404 || Then,
descending from the sky, the ten-faced one made his camp at the foot of the
Sammed mountain, on the mountain called Sansthali. || 405 || A sound like the
roar of a thunderclap from a cloud burst, filled the entire army with fear. ||
406 || The elephants, with their mighty trunks, broke the trees with their
tusks, and the horses, with their ears erect and their skin trembling, neighed
loudly. || 407 || Hearing this sound, the ten-faced one quickly asked, "What is
this? What is this? Who is ready to die today under the guise of an offense?" ||
408 || "Surely, it is Vaishravana who has arrived, or Soma, instigated by the
enemy, or perhaps some other enemy of mine, thinking I am secure and at ease."
|| 409 || Then, following his orders, the minister Prahasta went to that place
from where the sound was coming. There, he saw an elephant, playing, with a body
as large as a mountain. || 410 || Returning from there, Prahasta informed the
ten-faced one with great astonishment, "O God! Look at that elephant, like a
great mountain of clouds!" || 411 || "I have seen this elephant before, even
Indra, the king of gods, was unable to capture him, and so he left him. Or, let
Indra be, even the king of gods himself is unable to capture him, no one can
bear him. I don't know if this is an elephant or a collection of the combined
strength of all living beings!" || 412-413 || Then, laughing confidently, the
ten-faced one said, "Prahasta! Although it is not right to praise oneself, I
must say this much, if I don't capture this elephant in a moment, then I will
cut off these two arms of mine, which are afflicted by the armlet." || 414 ||

In the Padma Purana, "These two arms of mine are weighed down by armlets. If I
take even a single step, cut me down immediately." ||415|| Then, mounting the
celestial chariot Pushpaka, which moves at will, he went and saw the elephant,
endowed with excellent marks. ||416|| The elephant was like a smooth, dark blue
gem, his palate was red like a lotus, he bore long, round, white teeth like the
foam of nectar. ||417|| He was seven cubits high, ten cubits wide, and nine
cubits long. His eyes were somewhat yellow, like honey. ||418|| His backbone was
submerged in flesh, his forepart was high, his tail was long, his trunk was
huge, and his nail-like shoots were smooth and yellow. ||419|| His head was
round and thick, his feet were firmly planted, he was strong himself, his mighty
roar was sweet and deep from within, and he stood with humility. ||420|| The
intoxicating nectar that dripped from his temples attracted rows of bees. He
made a great sound like a drum, with the beating of his ear-shaped flaps.
||421|| He made the sky seem empty with his bulk, and he was playing a game that
stole hearts and eyes. ||422|| Seeing him, the son of Ratnaśrava attained
supreme joy. He considered himself successful, and his every hair stood on end
with delight. ||423|| Then, abandoning the chariot, he firmly tied his weapons
and blew a conch shell in front of him, filling the world with sound. ||424||
Then, the elephant, whose heart was agitated by the sound of the conch, and who
was filled with pride in his strength, roared and moved towards Dashaanan.
||425|| As the elephant rushed towards him with speed, Dashaanan, who was clever
at turning, quickly threw his white sheet in front of him. ||426|| While the
elephant was sniffing at the sheet, Dashaanan jumped up and touched his two
cheeks with his sharp teeth, which were like the sound of a swarm of bees.
||427|| While the elephant was wishing to wrap Dashaanan in his trunk, the
latter, endowed with lightness, slipped out between his teeth. ||428||
Dashaanan, who was as swift as lightning in his movements, touched his limbs on
all sides, repeatedly struck his teeth, and sometimes his tusks. ||429||

The Eighth Chapter  Then, adorned with splendor, Dasanana mounted the back of
the elephant. The elephant, like a devoted disciple, stood respectfully.
||430||  Then, the gods showered flowers and offered salutations repeatedly. The
celestial army, filled with joy, resounded with their voices. ||431||  Dasanana
bestowed upon the elephant the name "Trilokamandan" (Adorner of the Three
Worlds).  Indeed, the elephant adorned the three worlds, and Dasanana, filled
with joy, considered the name fitting. ||432||  A grand festival was held in
honor of the acquisition of this supreme elephant. The celestial beings, adorned
with flowers, danced on the beautiful mountain. ||433||  Even though everyone
was awake due to this event, the morning trumpet sounded a loud and resonant
note, marking the boundary between night and day, echoing through every cave of
the mountain. ||434||  Then, the sun rose, as if the day, skilled in service,
had presented a auspicious pot to Dasanana. ||435||  Dasanana, seated
comfortably, engaged in his bodily rituals, surrounded by the celestial beings
who discussed the elephant. ||436||  Suddenly, a man descended from the sky,
trembling violently, covered in sweat, burdened with sorrow, bearing wounds from
attacks, shedding tears, and revealing his frail body. He joined his hands,
placed them on his forehead, and with great distress, pleaded. ||437-438||  "O
Lord! Ten days ago, trusting in your strength, my brothers, Suryaksharajas and
Riksharajas, driven by their lineage, left Alankarpur, the netherworld Lanka,
with great enthusiasm to conquer the city of Kishka. ||439-440||  Both brothers
were filled with pride, accompanied by a massive army, and fearless. They
considered the world as insignificant as a blade of grass, due to their faith in
your power. ||441||  Inspired by these two brothers, a vast multitude, filled
with anger, descended upon Kishka and began to plunder. ||442||  Then, the
valiant warriors of Yama, the guardian of the underworld, armed with various
weapons, rose to fight. In the middle of the night, a great battle ensued among
them. ||443||

200 In the Padma Purana, there was a great battle between the two armies, with
many soldiers dying from the clash of weapons.  Hearing the sound of the battle,
Yama, the Lord of Death, himself went out to fight, his anger as fierce as the
ocean.  His immense power overwhelmed our army, leaving them wounded and
defeated.  The messenger, while narrating this, fainted.  He was revived by
fanning him with the edge of a cloth.  When asked what had happened, he placed
his hand on his heart and said, "Oh Lord, I felt like I was there, witnessing it
all, and fainted."   Then, Ravana, the son of Ratna Shrava, who was filled with
wonder, asked, "What happened next?"  After a moment of rest, the messenger
continued, "Oh Lord, when Rishyaraja saw our army defeated and in despair, he,
filled with love, prepared to fight himself."  He fought for a long time against
Yama, who was immensely powerful.  Though his heart did not break, he was
tricked and captured by the enemy.   While Rishyaraja was fighting, Suryaraja
also joined the battle.  He fought bravely for a long time, but eventually, he
was struck by a powerful blow and fainted.  His followers quickly carried him to
the forest called Mekhala, where he was revived with cool water mixed with
sandalwood.  Yama, believing himself to be the true Lord of Death, had created a
place of torment outside the city, including the river Vaitarani.  All those who
were defeated by him or by Indra, the King of the Gods, were sent to this place
of suffering, where they are now dying in pain.   Seeing this, I am deeply
troubled.  I am a loyal servant of the Rishyaraja lineage.  My name is
Shakhavali, and I am the son of Sushreni and Ranadaks.  Since you are our
protector, I managed to escape and come to you.

## Eighth Chapter  ~  Having understood the plight of my own people, I have
informed you.  Now, you are the authority in this matter, do as you deem fit. I
am satisfied having informed you.   Then, the great wrathful Ravana, with great
affection, ordered his people to heal the wounds of the branch.  Smiling, the
ten-headed one then addressed his people, saying, "I will rescue those who have
fallen into the ocean of suffering, those who have been cast into the torment of
the Vaitarani and other such places."  The valiant kings, led by Prahasta,
rushed forward, their weapons blazing, illuminating the sky.  They rode on
various vehicles, adorned with umbrellas and flags, their great enthusiasm
resonating with the sound of trumpets.  They were mighty warriors.  The lords of
the Vidyadharas descended from the sky and landed on earth, near the city.  They
were filled with wonder at the sight of the rows of palaces.  Then, Ravana saw
the group of humans who had been cast into the artificial hell in the southern
direction of Kishkindha.  He destroyed the guardians of hell and rescued all the
people, just as a relative would rescue their loved ones from suffering.
Hearing of the enemy's strength, the powerful Yama, the guardian of the
underworld, named Satop, emerged with his entire army, like a churning sea.  He
was accompanied by elephants, tall as mountains, fierce and spreading darkness
with their maddening roars; horses, adorned with beautiful, waving fly whisks;
chariots, shining like the sun, decorated with rows of flags; and valiant
warriors, clad in armor and armed with weapons.  Then, Vibhishana, mounted on
his chariot and skilled in the art of war, laughed and instantly killed Satop
with his arrows.  The lowly servants of Yama, struck by the arrows, fled in all
directions.

202 Having heard that he had freed the sons of Surya from Naraka and killed
Saatop, Yama, the lord of death, became very angry. He was as fierce as Yama
himself, and he mounted his chariot, his hand on his bow, his face filled with
rage. He was a mighty warrior, his banner flying high, his brow furrowed like a
serpent's, his eyes blazing red, as if he were burning the forest of the world.
He was surrounded by his own reflections, his vassals, and his chariot was
enveloped in a blaze of light. 471-474  Seeing Yama emerge, Dasanana restrained
Vibhishana and, filled with rage, prepared for battle. 475  Yama, his face
contorted with fury, was consumed by the death of Saatop and engaged Dasanana in
battle. 476  Seeing Yama, the Rakshasa army was terrified. Their movements
became sluggish, and they retreated in dismay to Dasanana's side. 477  Dasanana,
mounted on his chariot, then advanced towards Yama, showering him with arrows.
Yama responded in kind. 478  The sky was filled with the sound of their arrows,
as dense as a cloud of thunderheads. 479  Kaisika's son struck Yama's charioteer
with an arrow, and he fell to the ground like a fallen star. 480  Yama, struck
by a sharp arrow, was left without his chariot. He was so terrified that he
vanished into the sky in an instant. 481  Then, trembling with fear, Yama
returned to his inner palace, accompanied by his son and ministers. 482  He
bowed to Indra and said, "O God, hear my plea. I have no further use for the
game of Yama. 483  "Be pleased, or be angry, or take my life, or do whatever you
wish. I will not oppose the will of Yama." 484

## The Eighth Chapter  203  The valiant Dashaanan, who had defeated Vaishravana
in battle, had also defeated me, and I was defeated for a long time. ||485||
His body, like that of a valiant warrior, was made of pure valor. He was like
the sun in the middle of the sky, impossible to look at. ||486||  Hearing this,
the king of the gods, Indra, was ready for battle, but he was stopped by his
council of ministers, who knew the truth of the matter. ||487||  Hearing this,
Indra, smiling, said to Yama, his brother-in-law, "Where will Dashaanan go?
Don't be afraid, be at ease and sit comfortably on this seat." ||488||  Thus,
reassured by his brother-in-law's words, Yama, free from fear of his enemy,
lived happily in the city designated by Indra. ||489||  Honoring Yama, Indra
went to his inner palace, where he was immersed in the ocean of sensual
pleasures. ||490||  Yama had told Indra about Dashaanan's character, and how
Vaishravana had been exiled to the forest after being defeated by Dashaanan in
battle. All this was forgotten by Indra, who was intoxicated by his power, just
as a learned scripture is forgotten when it is not studied. ||491-492||  Even a
dream-like experience leaves some trace in the memory, but Indra had completely
forgotten what had been told to him earlier. ||493||  Meanwhile, Yama, having
become the lord of the city called "Surasangeet," completely forgot the
humiliation he had suffered at the hands of Dashaanan. ||494||  He thought, "My
daughter, Sarvasri, is extremely beautiful and even more dear to Indra than his
own life." ||495||  "My relationship with this great man is very close.
Therefore, my birth has been fulfilled by receiving Indra's respect." ||496||
Then, Dashaanan, full of great prosperity and enthusiasm, gave the city of
Kishkindha to Suryaraja, replacing Yama. ||497||  And he gave the city of
Kishkupura, a place of great wealth, to Riksharaja. Yama, having come to this
city in accordance with his lineage, lived happily there. ||498||  I wish to do
so, but I will no longer be Yama, the guardian of the realm. ||484||

204 Padma Purana They, both, having attained supreme prosperity, entered their
respective cities, Kishkindha and Ayodhya, which were like the city of Indra,
adorned with golden mansions and endowed with worthy rulers. || 499 ||   Ravana,
bearing great prosperity and fame, was proceeding towards the peak of Trikuta,
with his ministers bowing down to him. He was the best, and like the moon in the
bright fortnight, he was constantly filled with the wealth of his devotees. He
was riding on the beautiful Pushpaka Vimana, which could travel at will, adorned
with a garland of jewels and a row of lofty peaks. He was endowed with supreme
patience and had attained the fruits of his good deeds. || 500-503 || Then,
hordes of Rakshasas, filled with joy, adorned with various ornaments and wearing
the finest clothes, followed him, shouting auspicious words like, "Victory to
you, O Lord! May you prosper, live long, grow, and continue to attain progress."
|| 504-505 || They were mounted on various vehicles like lions, tigers,
elephants, horses, and swans. They were filled with various illusions, their
eyes were wide with joy, and they were adorned with the forms of the gods. Their
brilliance filled the directions, and their radiance illuminated all the
directions. They were moving through forests, mountains, and oceans. || 506-507
|| They saw the ocean, which was deep and boundless, filled with huge
crocodiles, dark like a Tamala forest, with waves as high as mountains,
terrifying with many large serpents like those in the netherworld, and adorned
with various jewels. They were filled with wonder and exclaimed, "Oh! Indeed!"
and other words of wonder. Thus, many Rakshasas followed Ravana. || 508-510 ||

The Eighth Chapter 205 Then, in the great hall of Maswan, surrounded by a deep
moat, adorned with white Kund gems, dark blue Mahaniil gems, red Padmarag gems,
bright Pushparag gems, and deep blue Garuda gems, the city of Lanka, naturally
beautiful, was further embellished by the devoted citizens, filled with wonder
and joy, at the arrival of their protector, the Rakshasa king, Dasanana.
Dasanana, the benevolent and generous ruler, entered his city, free from doubt,
like Indra himself.  As he entered, he enhanced the splendor of Lanka with
towering elephants like mountains, chariots adorned with jewels, resembling
grand palaces, with golden bridles that clinked and waved chamaras, colorful
flying machines that soared high into the sky, moon-like umbrellas, and flags
whose ends fluttered far and wide.  The sound of auspicious chants echoed from
the throngs of bards.  The vast sound of trumpets, mixed with the notes of the
veena, flute, and conch, filled the entire space and sky.  ||511-518|| Then,
those who were eager to see their lord, who had arrived in accordance with the
lineage, and who were adorned with beautiful clothes and ornaments, all the
citizens, accompanied by groups of captivating dancers, came before Dasanana,
holding offerings made of fruits, flowers, leaves, and jewels.  They bowed to
Dasanana, with the elders in front, and offered their salutations.  ||519-521||
Dasanana honored them all and dismissed them.  They all went to their homes,
praising his virtues.  ||522|| Then, Dasanana's house was filled with women,
whose minds were filled with curiosity and who were adorned with various
ornaments, eager to see him.  ||523|| Some of these women were coming to the
windows, their clothes loosened due to haste, and their ornaments were
disarranged due to the jostling.  ||524||

## Padma Purana  **Verse 525:**  The necklaces of the women were falling apart,
their breasts were heavy and they were pushing each other. The women were making
a lot of noise with their anklets and feet, as they moved around.  **Verse
526:**  "Mother, can't you see? Move aside, you are blocking my way!"  "Get out
of here, you don't belong here!"  These were the words being spoken by the
women.  **Verse 527:**  Their faces were blooming with joy, and they had
abandoned all other activities, their eyes fixed only on Dashaanan.  **Verse
528:**  Dashaanan, the vanquisher of Yama, resided in his beautiful palace,
adorned with jewels, like the jewel of Lanka, along with his inner court,
enjoying his happiness.  **Verse 529:**  The other Vidyaadhara kings, like the
Devas, were also experiencing great joy and remained in their respective places.
**Verse 530:**  Gautama Swami said to King Shrenik, "O Shrenik! Those who
perform pure actions, obtain various kinds of wealth, including jewels, their
powerful enemies are destroyed, and they attain glorious fame that spreads
throughout the world."  **Verse 531:**  "The five senses are the most powerful
enemies. Those who perform pure actions, even these powerful enemies lose their
memory in all three worlds, meaning they are destroyed to the point that they
are not even remembered. Similarly, the group of external enemies constantly bow
down at the feet of those who perform pure actions. In essence, both internal
and external enemies are destroyed for those who perform pure actions."  **Verse
532:**  "Therefore, O men of noble minds, it is not right to worship the enemies
in the form of worldly desires. Those who worship them fall into the abyss of
hell, filled with darkness, and do not attain the supreme state illuminated by
the rays of the sun."  **End of the Eighth Chapter of the Padma Charita,
composed by Ravishenaacharya, known as Aarsha, which narrates the story of
Dashaanan.**

## Ninth Chapter  And the Sun King begot a son named Bali from his queen
Chandramalini, a woman full of virtues. || 1 || He was always benevolent,
virtuous, wise, skillful, patient, blessed with fortune, valiant, knowledgeable,
adorned with arts, possessed of right vision, immensely strong, a master of
statecraft, a hero, compassionate, learned, radiant, and endowed with great
brilliance. || 2-3 || Just as the birth of excellent sandalwood is rare in the
world, so too is the birth of exceptional men like Bali. || 4 || Bali, with his
doubts dispelled, was devoted to the worship of all the Jina images, with pure
devotion. || 5 || He could circumambulate Jambudvipa, surrounded by four oceans,
thrice in a moment and return to his city of Kishkindha. || 6 || Bali, with his
extraordinary prowess, was a destroyer of the enemy forces, like the moon
blossoming the lotus-like eyes of the citizens, and he was always free from
doubt. || 7 || In the beautiful city of Kishkindha, adorned with colorful
palaces and gateways, filled with learned men, and teeming with elephants and
horses, and bustling with various markets, Bali enjoyed himself just as Indra,
adorned with a garland of jewels, enjoys himself in the heavenly abode of
Aishana. || 8-9 ||   Bali had a younger brother named Sugriva, who was also a
valiant hero, endowed with a charming form. || 10 ||

## English Translation:  208 In the Papuraana, Bali and Sugreeva, the ornaments
of the Kishkindha lineage, are to be known.  Their virtues, headed by humility,
were their ornaments. ||11|| After Sugreeva, a daughter named Shree-Prabha was
born, who was unparalleled in beauty on earth. She appeared like Shri (Lakshmi)
herself. ||12|| In the city of Kishku-Pramodanagara, Rishyaraja, the younger
brother of Suryaraja, had two sons, Nal and Neel, born to him by the queen
Harikanta. ||13|| These two sons brought joy to their kin, instilled fear in
their enemies, were adorned with noble qualities, and were like ornaments to
Kishku-Pramodanagara. ||14|| The wise Suryaraja, skilled in appropriate actions,
seeing that his son had attained the age of youth and was capable of upholding
the family tradition, renounced the kingdom for the sake of upholding Dharma and
gave it to Bali, making Sugreeva the crown prince. ||15-16|| Suryaraja, a
virtuous man, considered his kin and others as equal, and realizing the world of
four births (humans, animals, gods, and hell beings) to be afflicted by great
suffering, became a disciple of the Muni named Pihithamoha. He followed the
conduct of the Jina, as described by the Munis. He was free from desire even in
his body. His heart was as pure as the sky, he was free from attachment like the
wind, devoid of anger, and wandered the earth with the desire for liberation.
||17-19|| Then, Bali took as his wife a virtuous woman named Dhruva. Due to her
virtues, she was the foremost among his hundred wives. ||20|| Bali, adorned with
a beautiful crown bearing the mark of a monkey, whose commands were obeyed with
respect by the celestial kings, enjoyed great prosperity with queen Dhruva.
||21|| Meanwhile, Kharadushan, the son of Meghaprabha, who was constantly
seeking deceit, desired to abduct Chandranakha, the sister of Dashaanan
(Ravana). ||22|| From the moment Kharadushan saw Chandranakha, whose entire body
was beautiful, his body was consumed by lust. ||23||  1. Rupeṇa pratima m. 2.

The Ninth Chapter  The ten-headed king, Ravana, who was known to crush his
enemies, went to steal the daughter named Tanudari, born from the queen of the
Pravarajya, Avali. ||24|| Knowing that Lanka was devoid of the ten-headed king,
the skilled Kharadushana, proficient in both Vidya and Maya, easily abducted
Chandranakha. ||25|| What could the valiant Bhanukarna and Vibhishana do in
Lanka, when the enemy, using his Maya, was abducting the girl? ||26|| Seeing
that the army following him could not capture him alive in battle, Bhanukarna
and Vibhishana returned. ||27|| Hearing this news, the son of Kaikasi, Ravana,
became furious and his eyes became unbearable to look at. ||28|| Then, driven by
pride, he was ready to go back, even though the sweat from the fatigue of his
journey had not dried. ||29|| He took only a sword, not seeking help from anyone
else, for in battle, the only true companion of the powerful is the sword.
||30|| As Ravana was about to leave, Mandodari, who clearly understood the state
of the world, joined her hands and said, ||31|| "My Lord, it is certain that the
girl is meant for another, for that is the way of the world." ||32||
Kharadushana has fourteen thousand celestial beings, all powerful and never
retreating from battle. ||33|| Besides, he has mastered many thousands of Vidya,
haven't you heard this from the people? ||34|| If a fierce battle ensues between
you two, both equally powerful, there will be doubt about who will win. ||35||
Even if he is killed somehow, the girl, tainted by the act of abduction, cannot
be given to another, she will only become a widow. ||36|| Moreover, the sun's
rays have returned to your city, and the moon, known as "Alankaro-daya," shines
brightly in the sky. ||37||

In the Padma Purana, It is said that Kharadushana, a mighty warrior, resides
with your sister in the city of Padmapura. Your family has benefited from him.
||38|| Then Dashaanan said, "My dear, I am not afraid of war. However, I am
abiding by your words due to other reasons." ||39|| Then, due to the workings of
fate, Chandrodara, the Vidyadhara, met his end. His pregnant wife, Anuradha, was
left without shelter and, devoid of the power of knowledge, wandered aimlessly
in the forest like a deer. ||40-41|| Wandering, she reached the mountain called
Manikant. There, on a smooth rock covered with soft leaves and flowers, she gave
birth to a beautiful son. ||42|| Thereafter, the forest-dwelling mother, whose
mind was constantly troubled and whose life was sustained by the hope of her
son, raised him gradually. ||43|| Since the enemy had attacked the son while he
was still in the womb, the mother named him Viradhit, meaning "attacked," as he
was deprived of worldly pleasures. ||44|| Just as no one respects a hair that
has fallen from its place on the head, no one on earth respected Viradhit.
||45|| Unable to retaliate against his enemy, he harbored resentment in his
heart. Following traditional customs, he wandered through the lands he desired.
||46|| He enjoyed himself on the peaks of mountains, in beautiful forests, and
in extraordinary places where the gods visited. ||47|| He wandered, observing
the exploits of valiant men in battles filled with elephants and other
creatures, amidst beautiful banners, umbrellas, and other adornments. ||48||
Meanwhile, Dashaanan, resplendent and enjoying great pleasures, resided in the
city of Lanka like Indra himself. ||49|| Bali, a powerful warrior, served by
extraordinary knowledge, defied his orders. ||50|| Then Dashaanan sent a wise
messenger to Bali. Carrying the pride of his master, the messenger went to Bali
and said, "Dashaanan...

The ninth chapter  In the land of Bharata, I stand unmatched, a mighty warrior,
possessing immense strength, radiant brilliance, and a master of strategy. I am
blessed with great resources, wield a formidable weapon, and am destined for
greatness. The slayer of demons, Dasanana, commands you. ||52-53||  I, who had
vanquished Yama, the enemy of your father, the Sun-born, and established him as
the king of Kishkindha in the lineage of the Vanaras, ||54||  You, forgetting
the great favor done to you, are acting against your father. O virtuous one,
this is not right. ||55||  I will shower upon you the same love as your father,
or even more. Come to me today and pay your respects, so that you may dwell in
comfort. ||56||  Or, give me your sister, Sri Prabha, to be my wife. By forming
a bond with me, everything will become auspicious for you. ||57||  Seeing Bali
turn away from paying respects to Dasanana, the messenger, his face contorted
with anger, spoke again. ||58||  What is the point of saying more? Listen, O
Shakha-mriga! Hear my firm words. You are merely a pretender to a small fortune.
||59||  Prepare yourself to either give or take a weapon. Quickly, either take a
chamara (fly whisk) and become a servant to Dasanana, or take the direction-
mandala (the compass) and flee to the ends of the earth. ||60||  Either bow your
head or bend your bow. Either heed my command or place the unbearable string of
the bow, which can give you life, in your ears. ||61||  Either place the dust
from my feet on your head or wear a helmet to protect your head. Either fold
your hands in supplication or gather a large herd of elephants to beg for mercy.
||62||  Either release an arrow or embrace the earth. Either take a staff or a
garland. Either look into the nails of my feet or look into the mirror of my
sword. ||63||  Then, his mind inflamed by the messenger's harsh words, the
valiant warrior, known as Vyagravilambi, spoke. ||64||  O messenger! What has
Bali, the king of the earth, who is unmatched in his valor, done to you, that
you speak so harshly? ||65||

##  English Translation:  212 In the Padma Purana, it is clearly stated that he
was captured by the planet. But you are healthy, why are you praising him so
much, you lowly messenger? ||66||  Having said this, Vyāghravilombī became
enraged, his face was difficult to look at, and his body trembled visibly. In
this state, he was about to shoot an arrow at the messenger, but Bālī stopped
him, saying ||67|| What is the benefit of killing a poor messenger who is merely
conveying the words of his master? These people are just echoes of their
master's words. ||68|| Whatever is in his mind, Daśānana should do it. Surely,
Daśānana's lifespan is short, that's why he is speaking such harsh words. ||69||
Then, the terrified messenger went and reported everything to Daśānana, and the
wrath of Daśānana, who possessed unbearable power, was ignited. ||70|| He
immediately prepared his army and set out for Kiṣkindhā, for he was made of
atoms of pride. ||71|| Hearing the roar of the enemy army, which covered the
sky, Bālī, skilled in warfare, decided to leave the palace. ||72|| Then, Bālī,
who was burning with anger, was pacified by the wise ministers like
Sāgaravṛddhi, who poured out words like water, saying, "O Lord, let there be no
unnecessary war, forgive him. Many kings who loved war have perished without
reason." ||73-74|| Even those who were protected by the gods, who had the
support of the rays of the sun, and who were known as the eight lunar mansions,
perished by the arrows of Jayakumāra. ||75|| A vast army, difficult to look at,
armed with swords and maces, was also destroyed. Therefore, you should not get
on the unparalleled scale of doubt. ||76|| Hearing the words of his ministers,
Bālī said, "Although it is not proper to praise oneself, I will tell you the
truth, O ministers. ||77|| I am capable of crushing Daśānana, along with his
army, with just the flick of my eyebrow, with a blow from the palm of my left
hand." ||78||  Then 1. Bhāṣa from M., Kh., K. 2. Duḥprekṣaḥ M. 3. Gṛhāṇa M. 4.

The Ninth Chapter  What then, if the mind is inflamed by the fire of anger? What
is the use of actions that bring about fleeting pleasures? || 79 || Having
obtained these pleasures, which are like the pith of a banana tree, deluded
beings fall into hell, filled with great suffering. || 80 || What is the benefit
of inflicting pain on a group of beings who hold their lives dear, and then
claiming to have gained happiness? || 81 || These beings, like the buckets of an
*arhat* (water-lifting device), are constantly revolving in the well of
existence, filled with great suffering. || 82 || Having bowed down to the feet
of the Jinas, who are the cause of liberation from this world, how can I bow
down to anyone else? || 83 || When I was enlightened, I made a vow that I would
not bow down to anyone other than the lotus feet of the Jinas. || 84 || I will
not break this vow, nor will I harm any living beings. I accept the *pravrajya*
(renunciation), which grants liberation. || 85 || Those hands that were fit to
touch the breasts of the most beautiful women, and those arms that were adorned
with beautiful jeweled bracelets and were fit to embrace the most beautiful
women, are now used by that man to fold his hands in submission to his enemies.
What kind of wealth does he have? What kind of life does he have? || 86-87 ||
Saying this, he called his younger brother Sugriva and said, "Listen, my dear
boy! You are now the king, so bow down to Dasanana or don't, give him your
sister or don't, it doesn't matter to me. I am leaving home today. Do what you
think is best." || 88-89 || Saying this, Bali left his home and became a
*digambar* (sky-clad), like the moon in the sky, who is superior in virtues. ||
90 || He had now dedicated his mind to the ultimate truth. He had attained many
*abhyudaya* (spiritual progress) such as *riddhis* (supernatural powers). He was
always absorbed in one pure state of mind, he was a hero in enduring hardships,
he was pure in his *samyag darshan* (right faith), his soul was always absorbed
in *samyag jnana* (right knowledge), he was devoted to *samyag charitra* (right
conduct), and he contemplated his soul through *anupreksha* (reflection), free
from delusion. || 91-92 || He wandered only in those lands that were free from
subtle beings and were fit for the practice of *dharma* (righteousness), and
were served by great *munis* (ascetics) who had pure conduct. ||

In the Padma Purana, (93) He, dwelling in subtle, pure, and Dharma-aligned
lands, was served by great souls, the Munis of immaculate conduct. (94) He, like
a father, showed compassion to all beings, constantly nurturing inner tapas with
external tapas. (95) He, with a tranquil mind, attained the abode of great
wealth, embraced by the splendor of tapas, radiant with supreme beauty. (96) He,
striving to ascend the steps of high and higher virtues, was free from all knots
of the scriptures, his inner self being untied. (97) He, with great qualities,
saw everything through the scriptures, discerning right and wrong actions,
endowed with great restraint, destroying the lineage of karma. (98) He, for the
sole purpose of sustaining life, partook of food as prescribed by the Sutras,
sustaining life for Dharma, and acquiring Dharma for liberation. (99) He,
performing excellent deeds, brought joy to the world of the blessed, becoming a
model for the ascetics through his conduct. (100) Sugriva, having given Sri
Prabha to Dashagriva, happily ruled the kingdom inherited from his lineage, with
his permission. (101) Dashagriva, through his prowess, married all the beautiful
daughters of the Vidyadharas on earth. (102) Then, in the city of Nityaloka,
Dashagriva married Ratnavalli, the daughter born to the queen of Nityaloka, and
set out for his own city with great joy. (103) The sky was adorned with the rays
of the jewels adorning his crown. (104) Just as a great wind stops upon reaching
the shore of Mount Meru, so too did the Pushpaka chariot, as fickle as the mind,
suddenly stop. (105) When the Pushpaka chariot stopped, and the sound produced
by the bells and other things was broken, it seemed as if, due to the loss of
its brilliance, it had become silent out of shame. (106) Seeing the chariot
stop, the son of Kaikasi, filled with anger, asked, "Who is here? Who is here?"
(107) Then Maricha, knowing all things, said, "O Deva, listen! This is the Muni,
the image of the one who resides on Mount Kailasa."

## Ninth Chapter  **215**  A single Muni Raja statue, adorned with yoga, stands
there. ||107||  Facing the sun, his hands are like rays of light. On the level
ground of stone, he stands like a pillar of jewels. ||108||  This is a great
hero, bearing a terrible penance. He desires liberation quickly. This is the
story that has come to pass. ||109||  I will return the Vimana from this land
without delay. By the power of the Muni, it will come back piece by piece.
||110||  Hearing Maricha's words, the ten-headed one, proud of his own power,
looked towards Mount Kailasa. ||111||  Filled with various metals, adorned with
thousands of ganas, adorned with golden ornaments, and adorned with rows of
steps. ||112||  Adorned with natural elements, filled with transformations,
filled with various sounds, and comparable to grammar. ||113||  With sharp
peaks, it seems to break the sky. With clear waterfalls, it seems to laugh.
||114||  Drunken with nectar-like wine, filled with bees, the sky is covered
with a multitude of trees. ||115||  Adorned with flowers that bloom in all
seasons, filled with thousands of happy creatures. ||116||  Free from the fear
of medicines, filled with a multitude of snakes, it always holds youth with its
pleasant fragrance. ||117||  With a heart of vast stone, with thick trees as
arms, with a deep cave as a mouth, and with an unprecedented human form. ||118||

The mountain was covered with a multitude of white shores like the clouds of
autumn, and it seemed to be washing the entire world with its rays of light, as
if with milk. ||119|| In some of its caves, lions were sleeping without fear,
and in others, trees were swaying in the wind caused by the breath of sleeping
serpents. ||120|| In some of its forests, herds of deer were playing, and in
others, herds of intoxicated elephants were standing. ||121|| In some places, it
seemed as if its hairs were standing on end, due to the abundance of flowers,
and in others, its form was terrifying due to the long manes of ferocious bears.
||122|| In some places, it seemed as if it were covered with a forest of
lotuses, due to the red mouths of monkeys, and in others, the fragrance of
sandalwood was spreading due to the water flowing from the trees that had been
broken by rhinoceroses and elephants. ||123|| In some places, clouds were being
born, embraced by lightning-like vines, and in others, the sky was shining with
peaks that were as bright as the sun. ||124|| With its dense forests of tall
trees, adorned with fragrant flowers, the mountain seemed to be eager to conquer
the Pandu forest. ||125|| Descending upon the mountain, Dasanana saw the great
sage, who was immersed in the ocean of meditation and surrounded by a halo of
brilliance. ||126|| His two arms were hanging down like the trunks of elephants,
and he seemed to be a large sandalwood tree embraced by serpents. ||127|| He was
sitting motionless on a stone seat, engaged in the practice of sun-worship, and
he was causing doubt in the minds of living beings, as to whether they were
alive or not. ||128|| Recognizing him as Bali, Dasanana was consumed by the fire
of anger, remembering their past enmity. ||129|| With his brows furrowed, his
lips chewing, and his voice harsh, Dasanana, who was radiant in form, spoke to
the sage without fear. ||130|| "Oh, what a fine penance you have begun! Even
now, my chariot is being held back by your pride." ||131||

The Ninth Canto 217 Where is Dharma and where is anger? You are laboring in
vain, O foolish one! You wish to make the immortal and the poison one. ||132||
Therefore, I will destroy your arrogant pride today. I will uproot the Kailasa
mountain and throw it into the ocean along with you. ||133|| Then, he meditated
on all the Vidyaas, and they surrounded him. Then, Dashaanan, like Indra,
assumed a terrifying form. Entering the Patala, breaking through the earth, with
the forest of his mighty arms, he spread darkness all around. He was intent on
doing evil. ||134-135|| Then, Dashaanan, whose eyes were red with anger, and
whose face was filled with anger, began to lift Kailasa with his arms. ||136||
Finally, the Kailasa mountain, which was shaking the earth violently, moved from
its place. At that time, it was holding long, hanging snakes that were spitting
poison. The intoxicated elephants that had fallen into the clutches of lions
were escaping. The frightened groups of deer were standing with their ears
erect, looking around. The cracked earth had drunk all the water of the springs,
so their streams had dried up. The great trees were falling down all around,
making a loud noise. The groups of rocks were breaking and making a loud
cracking sound. And large stones were falling down with a thud, filling the
entire world with their sound. ||137-140|| The broken earth had drunk all the
water of the ocean, so it dried up. The rivers that flowed towards the ocean
were flowing backwards, devoid of purity. ||141|| The Pramathas looked in all
directions in fear, and were filled with great wonder. They began to say, "What
is this? What is this? Ha-ha-hum-hi!" ||142|| The Apsaras, frightened, left
their beautiful arbors of vines. The flocks of birds flew up into the sky,
making a chattering sound. ||143|| With the laughter of Dashaanan's ten mouths,
which were constantly emerging from the Patala, the sky split open along with
the directions. ||144|| 1. Mahavaayuvanenaath M. | 2. Nispheet Kh. | 3. Sattvai:

218 When the entire universe was agitated by the wind named Samvartaka, the Lord
Balimuni, knowing the demon by his knowledge, recognized him. ||145|| Although
he himself was not suffering and his entire body was still as before, he, being
a wise and fearless man, free from anger, thought in his mind: ||146|| The
Chakravarti Bharat has built these magnificent, high-rise Jain temples, made of
all kinds of precious jewels. Devotees, filled with devotion, both gods and
demons, worship them every day. If this mountain were to move, these Jain
temples might be destroyed. ||147|| Thinking thus, the Muni Balimuni, whose
consciousness was close to the auspicious meditation, pressed the top of the
mountain with his big toe. ||148-149|| Then, the demon, whose forest of arms was
heavily burdened and was breaking excessively, who was overwhelmed with sorrow,
whose red, beautiful eyes were restless, became extremely distressed. His crown
fell off and the weight of the mountain fell on his bare head. He knelt on the
sinking earth. Due to his bulk, his thighs were submerged in his muscles.
||150-151|| Immediately, a stream of sweat flowed from his body and washed the
netherworld. His whole body contracted like a tortoise. ||152|| At that time,
since he had shouted with all his might and made the whole universe resound, he
later became known as 'Ravana', a name that is prevalent everywhere. ||153||
Hearing that mournful, unprecedented sound of their lord, the group of Ravana's
wives became distressed and began to wail. ||154|| The ministers were
bewildered. They were ready for war and wandered around aimlessly. Their words
kept stumbling and their weapons fell from their hands. ||155|| Due to the power
of the Muni's strength, the drums of the gods began to sound and a shower of
flowers, along with bees, covered the sky. ||156|| The divine princes, whose
nature it was to play, danced in the sky and the melodious sound of the
goddesses echoed with the sweet sound of the flute. ||157|| 1. This verse is not

The Ninth Chapter 219 'Then Mandodari, humbled, bowed to the sage and requested,
"O Muni, possessor of wondrous prowess, grant me husband-alms." ||158|| Then,
moved by compassion, the great sage loosened his toe. Ravana, freed from the
mountain, emerged from the wilderness of suffering. ||159|| Going and bowing,
repeatedly seeking forgiveness, he, knowing the power of his penance, began to
praise the Lord of Yoga. ||160|| "I do not offer obeisance to anyone else,
having renounced the feet of the Jina. This is the fruit of my strength, as I
myself have said." ||161|| "Oh, your penance is truly powerful, O Lord, by which
you are able to make the three worlds otherwise." ||162|| "Even the Indras do
not possess such power, O Lord, as is born from the slight effort of those who
are rich in penance." ||163|| "Oh, your qualities, your form, your radiance,
your strength, your brilliance, your patience, your character, and your penance
are all wondrous." ||164|| "It seems as if your body, the foundation of merit,
has been created by karma, bringing all the beautiful things from the three
worlds." ||165|| "You, who are endowed with such extraordinary power, have
renounced the earth. This is a truly wondrous deed that you have done, O good
man." ||166|| "I, being powerless, have only brought about the bondage of sin by
desiring to do something wrong to you, who are endowed with such power." ||167||
"Curse this body, this mind, and this speech of mine, which, being sinful, has
become inclined towards falsehood." ||168|| "The difference between you, such
noble gems, and us, wicked people, is as great as that between Mount Meru and a
mustard seed." ||169|| "O Muni, you have given me life when I was dying. What
can be said about one whose mind is so wicked as to repay kindness with harm?"
||170|| "I hear, I know, and I see that the world is only a source of suffering.
Yet, I am so sinful that I do not renounce worldly attachments." ||171|| "Those
who are virtuous, great in character, and close to the fortune of liberation,
have renounced worldly pleasures in their youth and stand firm in the path of
liberation." ||172||

220 Having praised the Muni in this way, Ravana bowed down to him thrice,
circumambulated him, and, utterly condemning himself, wept with a face full of
sorrow. ||173|| Filled with shame and detached from worldly attachments, the son
of Kaikasi entered the Jain temple near the Muni. ||174|| Throwing his sword,
Chandras, on the ground in disregard, he, accompanied by his wives, performed
worship to the Jina. ||175|| Pulling the string of his arm, which was like a
musical instrument, he played the Veena and praised the Jina with hundreds of
hymns. ||176|| "Salutations to you, the Lord of Lords, the observer of all
worlds, who have transcended all worlds with your brilliance, who are fulfilled,
the great soul. ||177|| You are worshipped by the three worlds, you have
destroyed the great enemy, delusion. You are the holder of a multitude of
qualities beyond the reach of words. ||178|| You are endowed with great power,
the guide to the path of liberation, rich in the ultimate happiness, you have
removed all evil. ||179|| You are the cause of liberation and prosperity for all
beings, the root of great auspiciousness, the creator of all actions. ||180||
You have burnt all sins with the fire of meditation, you are the destroyer of
birth, the Guru, you have no Guru, all bow down to you, and you bow down to
none. ||181|| You are free from beginning and end, you are a continuous, eternal
yogi, your ultimate truth is unknown, but you know all ultimate truths. ||182||
You have declared the soul to be devoid of all attachments, you have taught the
doctrine of existence for all. You have shown that all things are momentary
according to the Nayavada, and you have also shown that all things are eternal
according to the Dravyavada. ||183|| You have said that our soul is a single,
undivided substance, distinct from all external objects. You are the advocate of
the Anekantavada for all, the conqueror of all enemies, the knower of all
things, therefore, you are the one who grants liberation. ||184||  Those who
have abandoned worldly attachments and are established in the path of liberation
are blessed souls, they are powerful, and they dwell near the liberated Lakshmi.

||185|| Salutations to Sumati, the radiant one, salutations to Him. Salutations
to Suparshva, forever shining like the moon. ||186|| Salutations to Pushpadanta,
the cool one, salutations to Him. Salutations to Shreyansa, the worthy of
worship, salutations to the one who has attained spiritual brilliance. ||187||
Salutations to Vimala, salutations to the infinite, forever. Salutations to
Dharma, the root cause of happiness, salutations to Shanti, the one who brings
peace. ||188|| Salutations to Kunthu Jinendra, salutations to Aranatha, forever.
Salutations to Malli Maharaja, salutations to Munisuvrata. ||189|| Salutations
to all the other Tirthankaras of the past and future, salutations to them.
Salutations to the Sadhus, forever. ||190|| Salutations to the one who is
endowed with right faith, knowledge, and the destruction of the path of
isolation. Salutations to the vision, forever. Salutations to the Siddhas,
forever. ||191|| Thus, the Lord of Lanka, Ravana, chanted these sacred words.
The seat of the Nagaraja, Dharanendra, trembled. ||192|| Then, the Nagaraja,
with a noble heart, emerged from the netherworld, his soul illuminated by the
light of knowledge, his eyes wide with joy, his raised hoods adorned with gems
that dispelled the darkness, and his face radiant like the full, pure moon.
||193-194|| He bowed to the Jinendras and then performed a ritualistic worship,
in which all wealth was obtained through meditation alone. ||195|| He said to
Ravana, "O virtuous one, you have sung a very good song, connected to the praise
of the Jinendras. Your song is a cause of excitement." ||196|| "See, my body is
filled with dense and rough goosebumps due to joy. Even though I live in the
netherworld, I still do not find peace." ||197|| "O Lord of the Rakshasas, you
are blessed to praise the great Jinendras. Your devotion has forcefully drawn me
here." ||198|| "I am very pleased with your devotion to the Jinendras. Ask for a
boon, I will give you your desired object, which is rare even for the wicked."

222 In the Padma Purana, what is more auspicious than the worship of the Jinas?
I am eager to give you something, so tell me what you desire. ||201|| Then the
Nagapati said, "Listen, Ravana, there is no other auspicious thing equal to the
worship of the Jinas." ||202|| The worship of the Jinas, when performed with
devotion, bestows the bliss of liberation. There has never been and never will
be anything equal to it. ||203|| Then Dasamukha said, "If there is nothing
greater than the worship of the Jinas, and I have attained it, then what else
should I ask for, O wise one?" ||204|| The Nagapati said, "Your words are true.
What is unattainable by the power of the Jinas does not exist." ||205|| Those
like you, those like us, and those like Indra and the others, who are the
foundations of happiness, all have attained it through devotion to the Jinas.
||206|| Let this worldly happiness, which is small and fraught with obstacles,
remain. Through devotion to the Jinas, the supreme bliss of liberation is
attained. ||207|| Although you are a renunciant, endowed with great humility,
strength, supreme wealth, and adorned with virtues, let my sight of you not be
in vain. I beg you to accept something from me. ||208-209|| O Lankeśa, accept
this Vidya called Amoghavijaya, which has the power to transform into any form.
Do not break my affection. ||210|| O good man, whose time passes in a single
Dasha? After misfortune comes prosperity, and after prosperity comes misfortune.
||211|| Therefore, if misfortune approaches you from any source, this Vidya will
protect you, causing harm to your enemies. ||212|| Even the gods, who possess
immense power, are afraid of this Vidya, which is enveloped in flames of fire.
||213|| In the end, Ravana could not break the affection of the Nagapati, and
with great difficulty, he accepted the gift. ||214|| Then, with folded hands and
bowing, Ravana, who had spoken to Dasanana, went to his own place, filled with
joy. ||215||

## Ninth Chapter  The Naga King, having conversed, went to his own place with
great joy. ||215||  Having stayed on Mount Kailasa for twenty-two and a half
months, Ravana also, after paying homage to the Jina, went to the desired place.
||216||  Knowing the turmoil of his mind, Bali, the Muni, considered himself
bound by evil karma and went to the Guru to perform penance. ||217||  Just as
Vishnu Kumar, the great Muni, became happy after performing penance, so too did
Bali, the Muni, become happy after the removal of the thorn from his heart
through penance. ||218||  Through conduct, secrecy, religion, non-observation,
assemblies, and endurance of the Pariṣaha, Bali, the Muni, attained Mahāsamvara.
He stopped the creation of new karmas and began to destroy the accumulated
karmas through tapas. In this way, through Samvara and Nirjara, he attained
Kevala Jnana. ||219-220||  Finally, having destroyed the eight karmas, he went
to the peak of the three worlds, where infinite happiness is attained. ||221||
Knowing, "I am defeated by one who is capable of conquering the senses," Ravana
became humble before the Sadhus. ||222||  Possessing right faith, with firm
devotion to the Jina, Ravana, not satisfied with supreme pleasures, remained as
he desired. ||223||  Gautama Swami said to King Śreṇika, "O Śreṇika! The noble
person who, being devoted to good qualities, listens to this story of Bali, the
Muni, will never be defeated by others and will attain the radiant position like
the sun." ||224||  Thus, the ninth chapter of the Padmacharita, composed by the
Acharya Ravishena, known as Ārṣa, which narrates the Nirvana of Bali, is
complete. ||9||  **Notes:**  * **Samvara:** Cessation of the inflow of new
karmas. * **Nirjara:** Destruction of accumulated karmas. * **Kevala Jnana:**
Omniscience. * **Pariṣaha:** A group of people who are hostile to the Jain
faith. * **Mahāsamvara:** A state of complete spiritual purity. * **Jina:** A
victorious one, a title given to the Tirthankaras. * **Sadhus:** Holy men,
ascetics. * **Ārṣa:** A term used to describe something that is ancient or
traditional.

### The Tenth Chapter  Thus, O Shrenika, you have come to know this story. Now,
I will speak further; listen to what I hold dear. ॥1॥  In Jyotipur, the daughter
of the flame, a girl named Sutara was born from the womb of Queen Hrī. She was
renowned throughout the earth for her beauty and seemed to have come straight
from the abode of the lotus, like Lakshmi herself. ॥2-3॥  One day, the wicked
Vidyadhara named Sahasagati, born of King Chakranka and Queen Anumati, was
wandering about at his will and saw Sutara. ॥4॥  Upon seeing her, he was pierced
by the arrow of desire and was immensely troubled. Mind always enveloped with
the thought of Sutara, he behaved as if he were mad. ॥5॥  He sent messenger
after messenger, pleading for her, while on the other side, Sugriva was also
requesting the lovely maiden. ॥6॥  'To whom should I give my daughter?' With
this doubt arising in him, King Agnishikha was unable to decide, and his soul
remained in a state of turmoil. Finally, he inquired of the great sage. ॥7॥  The
great sage Munichandra then spoke: "Sahasagati will not live long; he is of
short life, while Sugriva, on the other hand, is of long life and bearer of
supreme prosperity." ॥8॥  Due to the strength of the side of Chakranka, the
father of Sahasagati, King Agnishikha could not resolve his doubts about
Munichandra’s words. Then, Munichandra caused his words to be firmly established
by taking two lamps, two bulls, and a royal elephant as a sign. ॥9॥  Afterward,
knowing the words of the sage to be like nectar, King Agnishikha brought his
daughter Sutara and, with auspicious rites, gave her to Sugriva. ॥10॥  Sugriva,
whose merit was great, married the maiden and obtained abundant wealth along
with excellent enjoyments of carnal pleasures. ॥11॥  Subsequently, Sugriva and
Sutara had two sons in due course, both of whom were exceedingly handsome. The
elder son was named Anga, and the younger son became renowned as Angada. ॥12॥

**Chapter Ten**  Even now, the shameless son of the celestial architect does not
abandon his hope for the daughter. How shameful, this tainted hope born from
desire! || 13 || This lustful man, consumed by the fire of passion, constantly
reflects on how he can obtain that bliss-giving maiden. || 14 || When shall I
kiss her face, which outshines the moon, her lips adorned with a resplendent red
hue? || 15 || When shall I play with her in the gardens of Nandana, and when
shall I partake in the joy that comes from the touch of her ample breasts? || 16
|| Thus, contemplating the reasons for their union, he recalled the
transformative power of the Shērmuśī knowledge. || 17 || Just as a dear friend
continuously worships his sorrowful companion, the son of the celestial
architect ascended the great Himalayas, seeking refuge in its inaccessible cave
and began to engage in the worship of that knowledge. || 18 || Meanwhile,
Ravana, having set out to conquer the directions, wandered around gazing at the
earth adorned with mountains and forests. || 19 || After defeating the kings of
the Vidyadhara residing in various islands, the mighty Ravana appointed them
back in their respective kingdoms. || 20 || His heart was tender towards the
kings he had subdued, just as a father feels affection for his sons. Truly so,
for great souls are easily satisfied with mere respects. || 21 || He had
subjugated all those bold kings of the Rakshasa and vanara lineages. || 22 ||
When Ravana traveled the skies with his vast army, his wind-like speed rendered
the other Vidyadharas incapable of withstanding it. || 23 || The kings such as
Sandhyākāra, Suvela, Hemāpūrṇa, Suyodhana, Haṁsadvīpa, and Parihālāda came
forth, presenting gifts and bowing with folded hands, honoring him with their
foreheads. Ravana, in return, satisfied them with sweet words and restored their
fortunes to their former state. || 24 ||

In the Padma Purana, Even though they were dwelling in very difficult places,
the lords of the sky bowed down to his feet with auspicious previous deeds.
||26|| The Acharya says that among all strengths, the strength created by
actions is the greatest. With its rise, what king could not be conquered by him?
That is, he was capable of conquering everyone. ||27|| Then, as he was about to
go to conquer Indra, the king of the Vidhyadharas of Rathnapur, he remembered
his sister Chandra-nakha and her husband Khar-dushan with great affection.
||28|| He set out and reached the vicinity of Patala-lanka. When his sister
heard that her beloved brother was near and had arrived, she was filled with
excitement. ||29|| It was the last watch of the night, and Khar-dushan was
sleeping peacefully. Chandra-nakha woke him up with great love. ||30|| Then,
Khar-dushan, emerging from Alankar-odayapur (Patala-lanka), worshipped Ravana
with great devotion and with great celebration. ||31|| Ravana, in turn,
worshipped his sister with affection. It is true that there is no love greater
than the love of a brother. ||32|| Khar-dushan showed Ravana fourteen thousand
Vidhyadharas who could change their forms at will. ||33|| Ravana made Khar-
dushan, who was very skilled, a valiant warrior, and who had attracted the minds
of all his vassals with his qualities, his equal in command. ||34|| Just as the
Chamarendra, surrounded by a host of Asuras, emerges from Patala, so Ravana,
accompanied by Khar-dushan and other Vidhyadharas, who were skilled in all kinds
of weapons, set out from Patala-lanka. ||35|| Hidamba, Haihido, Dimba, Vikata,
Trijata, Haya, Makota, Sujata, Tanka, the king of Kishkindha, Tripura, Malaya,
Hemapala, Kola, and Vasundhara, and other kings were riding on various vehicles.
All these kings were adorned with various weapons. ||36-37|| Just as the month
of Shravana is filled with clouds filled with lightning and rainbows, so was
Dasanan filled with all those Vidhyadhara kings. ||38|| Thus, shaking Kailasa,

## The Vashma Parva **227**  Ravana had gathered an army of more than a thousand
Akshauhinis of Vidyadharas.  Each of them was protected by thousands of Devas,
adorned with jewels, and bearing the weight of countless virtues.  They were
fanned by chamaras resembling clusters of moonbeams, and Ravana himself was
adorned with a white umbrella, his long arms graceful and beautiful.  He rode
atop the Pushpaka Vimana, which shone like the sun on Mount Meru, and his aerial
chariot covered the sky like a celestial canopy.  Ravana, filled with the desire
to destroy Indra, marched forward with his army, driven by his ambition.  The
sky resembled an ocean, filled with the brilliance of countless jewels.  The
chamaras, like waves, rippled across the heavens.  The sky was filled with
celestial beings, like fish in the sea, and the celestial chariots, like
whirlpools, swirled through the air.  The army, like crocodiles, consisted of
horses, elephants, and foot soldiers, and the weapons, like waves, crashed
through the sky.  The sky was adorned with towering banners, adorned with
peacock feathers, resembling a sky filled with diamonds and sapphires.  The
celestial chariots, adorned with jewels and soaring peaks, made the sky resemble
a celestial realm.  King Shrenik, the ruler of Magadha, said to Gautam Swami,
"What more needs to be said? I believe even the Devas are terrified at the sight
of Ravana's army."  Among Ravana's forces were Indrajeet, Meghavahan,
Kumbhakarna, Vibhishan, Kharadushan, Nikumbha, and Kumbha, along with countless
other warriors skilled in battle, all blessed with divine knowledge and mastery
of weapons and scriptures.

228 In the Padma Purana, the Hepayantas, possessing great wealth and fortune,
followed Ravana, filled with joy, being renowned for their vast glory. ||51||
Then, as the sun set near the Vindhyas, it seemed to be eclipsed by Ravana's
brilliance, as if ashamed. ||52|| Ravana then stationed his army on the peak of
the Vindhyas, where they found shelter due to their knowledge and power. ||53||
As if fearing Ravana, the moon, the lord of the Rohini constellation, arose,
dispelling the darkness with his rays. ||54|| The night, adorned with stars like
flowers on her head and the moon as her face, arrived before Ravana, like a
beautiful woman wearing a pure sky-colored garment. ||55|| The night was spent
by the celestial beings in pleasant conversation, filled with diverse stories
and appropriate activities. ||56|| Then, awakened by the morning trumpets and
auspicious sounds of the attendants, Ravana performed all the actions of his
body. ||57|| As if having wandered through the entire universe without finding
another refuge, the sun returned to Ravana's shelter. ||58|| Then, Ravana saw
the Narmada River, which seemed to be engaged in a lively conversation with a
multitude of birds, their sweet voices echoing. ||59|| The river, adorned with
foam, appeared to be laughing, her water as pure as crystal, and she was graced
by elephants. ||60|| The Narmada, with her flowing waves like eyebrows, her
whirlpool like a navel, her fish like eyes, her vast banks like hips, adorned
with various flowers, and her pure water like a garment, appeared like a
beautiful woman, filling Ravana with great joy. ||61-62|| The Narmada, sometimes
deep due to the presence of fierce crocodiles, sometimes flowing swiftly,
sometimes moving slowly, and sometimes winding like a serpent, ||63|| was full
of diverse movements, and though fearsome, was also beautiful. Ravana, whose
mind was filled with curiosity, entered the Narmada River with great respect.

Here is the English translation of the provided verse, preserving the Sanskrit
terms:  ---  **10th Pavan**   Then, the king of Mahishmati, known for his
strength, entered the Narmada from another direction. He, known as
Sahasraramshi, descended to this place. || 65 || That Sahasraramshi was truly
very beautiful, as he was accompanied by thousands of women adorned with
splendid beauty. || 66 || He had ordered various water mechanisms crafted by
expert artisans, and taking their shelter, he was delightfully engaged in
diverse sports at that moment. || 67 || Having with him many men skilled in
crafting machines—who were also capable of holding back the ocean’s waters—he
wandered in the Narmada as per his wishes, undeterred by its currents. || 68 ||
Due to the application of these mechanisms, the waters of the Narmada were
halted instantly, allowing skilled women to move about near its banks, fully
engrossed in play. || 69 || The extremely fine and bright garments of the women
clung to their forms as they splashed in the water, causing them to feel bashful
whenever their husbands glanced their way. || 70 || One woman, whose breasts
were displayed by the marks of her nails, was creating jealousy in her co-wife.
|| 71 || Another excellent woman, whose entire body was visible, bashfully
splashed water towards her husband with both hands, full of longing. || 72 ||
One woman, spotting the marks from claws on her rival's hips, playfully struck
her husband with the water splashed from the lotus-like hands. || 73 || A woman
of an angry disposition stood silently, unmoving; her husband then bowed at her
feet and in some way earned her pleasure. || 74 || As long as the king
Sahasraramshi pleased one woman, another would end up perturbed. As a result, he
found it exceptionally challenging to satisfy all the women. || 75 || Surrounded
by the finest women and possessing a charming appearance, the king displayed
various expressions of anger, joy, and reverence towards others—showing
affection by throwing water and other gestures. || 76 ||   ---   This
translation integrates the original Sanskrit terms while interpreting the
literary and narrative aspects from the text.

In the Padma Purana,  Women, like ornaments on a sandy shore, did not wish to
pick up their ornaments that had fallen, their hearts filled with great
compassion. ||80|| One woman made the water white with sandalwood paste, while
another made it golden yellow with saffron. ||81|| The lips of the women, whose
red betel stain had faded, and the eyes, whose kohl had smudged, had a unique
beauty. ||82|| Then, in the water released by the mechanism, the king, with many
excellent women who aroused desire, enjoyed himself as he pleased. ||83|| The
sound of the women playing in the water, like the chirping of birds on the
shore, seemed to be the sound of their ornaments. ||84|| Meanwhile, Ravana,
having bathed comfortably and wearing clean, fine clothes, carefully adorned his
head with a white cloth. ||85|| Ravana, with great effort, established the image
of the Arhant, made of gold and jewels, which was always carried by appointed
men, on the bank of the river. The bank was new, beautiful, white, radiant,
adorned with a high platform made of sand, where a canopy was spread on sticks
of lapis lazuli, with strings of pearls hanging from it, and filled with
attendants eager to gather all kinds of equipment. ||86-88|| Having established
the image, he performed a great puja with incense, sandalwood, flowers, and
beautiful offerings, which attracted the senses with their strong fragrance, and
sat in front, for a long time, filling his mouth with the pure words of praise.
||89-90|| Suddenly, Ravana, engrossed in the puja, was struck by the foam and

## The Tenth Canto **6**  Then, Dashaanan (Ravana) quickly picked up the statue
and, enraged, asked the immortals, "What is this?" || 92 ||  Then, following
swiftly, the men returned and reported, "O Lord, there is a great man here. ||
93 ||  He sits amidst beautiful women, the epitome of joy, surrounded by men
wielding swords, standing at a distance. || 94 ||  There are many large machines
of various kinds. Surely, this feat was accomplished by them. || 95 ||  We
believe that the men with him are merely for show. His true strength is
formidable, unbearable to others. || 96 ||  It is said that there is a king
named Indra in heaven or on Mount Meru. But we have seen this Indra before our
very eyes. || 97 ||  Hearing the sound of the mridanga, mixed with the sounds of
the veena, flute, and the shouts of victory, and the sounds of elephants,
horses, and men, all urging the kings to action, Dashaanan became furious and
commanded, "Capture this wicked man quickly!" || 98-99 ||  Following the
command, Dashaanan performed the highest worship of the Jina statue on the
riverbank, with offerings of jewels, gold, and flowers. || 100 ||  The
Vidhyadhara kings, taking Dashaanan's command as a sacred duty, rushed towards
the enemy, fully armed. || 101 ||  Seeing the enemy forces approaching,
Sahasrakirana (the hero) was enraged. He gave assurance to the women and quickly
emerged from the lake. || 102 ||  Hearing the commotion and knowing the news
from the crowd, the warriors of Mahishmati, filled with fear, rushed out. || 103
||  Mounted on elephants, horses, and chariots, surrounded by foot soldiers, and
accompanied by their vassals wielding various weapons, they rushed towards
Sahasrakirana, filled with immense devotion. || 104-105 ||  Seeing the
approaching army of Vidhyadharas, the vassals of Sahasrakirana, abandoning their
fear of death, rushed to meet them. || 106 ||

232 Puranas Seeing the army of the Vidyadharas approaching, the Samantas of
Sahasrarashmi, who were eager to protect each other and filled with enthusiasm,
abandoned their desire for life, formed a cloud formation, and rose to fight
without waiting for their lord's command. ||106-107|| Meanwhile, when Ravana's
army was ready to fight, the following words of the gods suddenly echoed in the
sky. ||108|| The gods said, "Oh! These brave men want to commit a great
injustice by engaging in battle with the Vidyadharas, who are earth-dwellers."
||109|| "These poor earth-dwellers are few in number and simple-minded, while
the Vidyadharas, on the other hand, are masters of knowledge and illusion and
are very numerous." ||110|| Hearing these words of anxiety, which were repeated
again and again in the sky, the Vidyadharas, who were of good character, were
filled with shame and descended to the earth. ||111|| Then, in the battle that
was started by equal warriors, Ravana's men began to strike each other with
swords, arrows, maces, and spears. ||112|| The charioteers fought with the
charioteers, the horsemen with the horsemen, the elephant riders with the
elephant riders, and the foot soldiers with the foot soldiers. ||113|| Those who
were being defeated one after another and whose weapons were clashing, creating
fire, began to fight justly. ||114|| When Sahasrarashmi saw his army on the
verge of destruction, he immediately mounted his excellent chariot and arrived.
||115|| Sahasrarashmi, adorned with an excellent crown and armor, possessed
extraordinary brilliance, and therefore, seeing the army of the Vidyadharas, he
was not afraid in the least. ||116|| Then, those who had regained their strength
due to being united with their lord, whose umbrellas were open, and who had
forgotten the pain of their wounds, entered the army of the Rakshasas like
intoxicated elephants entering a deep sea. ||117-118|| Just as the wind drives

The king, seated on his chariot and wielding a bow, made the world seem like
mere grass, driving back your army a yojana with a shower of arrows.
||120-121|| Seeing Sahasrarashmi approaching, Dashaanan mounted his elephant,
Trilokamanadan.  ||122||  Ravana, whose brilliance was unbearable, was seen by
his terrified enemies, and he released a shower of arrows, leaving Sahasrarashmi
chariotless.  ||123|| Then Sahasrarashmi, mounted on a superior elephant,
charged again, filled with wrath, towards the Rakshasa king.  ||124||  The
arrows released by Sahasrarashmi pierced the armor and tore apart the limbs of
Dashaanan, whose faces were sharp as blades.  ||125||  Ravana, pulling the
arrows from his body, laughed and said to Sahasrarashmi, "Oh Ravana, you seem to
be a great archer. From whom did you receive this skill?"  ||126||  "My boy,
first learn the art of archery and practice, then you can fight me. You seem to
be devoid of wisdom."  ||128||  Enraged by these harsh words, Ravana struck
Sahasrarashmi on the forehead with a spear.  ||129||  A stream of blood flowed,
and his eyes spun.  ||130||  While Sahasrarashmi was dazed and regaining his
senses, Ravana, with a swift leap, captured the valiant warrior.  ||131||
Ravana bound him and took him to his camp.  ||132||  The celestial beings
watched in amazement, wondering who could capture him if he were to escape.
||132||  The sun, surrounded by the ramparts of twilight, set, as if
Sahasrarashmi had learned a lesson from this incident.  ||133||  The world was
enveloped in darkness, making good and evil indistinguishable, as if it were
shrouded by the immense anger of Ravana.  ||134||

##  Chapter 234  135. The moon-like disc of the extremely pure fame of Ravana,
obtained from the battle, rose, like a learned scholar dispelling darkness.
136. Some were applying ointment to the wounds of the soldiers, some were
describing the valor of the warriors, some were searching for the missing
soldiers, and some, who were not wounded, were sleeping. Thus, the night of
Ravana's army passed according to the appropriate tasks.  137. When the morning
dawned, Ravana was awakened by the sound of the morning trumpets.  138. Then,
the sun, bearing extreme anger, rose trembling, as if it had come to know the
news of Ravana.  139. Hearing that his son was bound, the thousand-rayed, the
Digambara, the lord of the Jhangharacharan Siddhi, the great-armed, the great-
penitent, came to Ravana.  140. He was as beautiful as the moon, as radiant as
the sun, as steady as Mount Meru, and as deep as the ocean.  141. Having
completed his bodily duties, he sat comfortably in the midst of the assembly,
his mind calm and full of love for the people.  142. Seeing the Muni from afar,
Ravana stood up and bowed his head to the ground.  143. When the Muni sat on the
excellent throne, Ravana sat on the ground, his hands joined in humility, his
whole body bowed in reverence.  144. Ravana said, "O Lord! You are accomplished,
so there is no other reason for your coming here except to purify me."  145.
Then, praising Ravana's lineage, valor, and glory, the Muni, like a stream of
nectar, said, "O long-lived one! This is indeed the result of your good
intentions. However, I have something to say, listen."  146. "For Kshatriyas,
victory over their enemies is the only fulfillment. Therefore, release my son,
Sahasrarashmi."  147. Then, after consulting with his ministers through
gestures, Ravana, bowing to the Muni, said, "O Lord! My request is as follows. I
am currently infatuated with the royal fortune and have offended our ancestors,
the lord of the Vidyadharas, Mudyot."

---------------------------
The Tenth Canto 235 I declare, O Lord, that I have set out to subdue the King of
the aerial beings. I have done what my ancestors did to subdue the proud Sri.
||149|| On my way, I performed the worship of the Jina on the beautiful bank of
the Reva, with a wheel of gems, on a pure platform of sand. ||150|| That
worship, along with its paraphernalia, was carried away by the swift current of
water, created by the device of this Moghi. ||151|| Then, due to the destruction
of the image of the Jina, I was filled with great anger. I have done this deed
for a purpose, and I do not hate any human being without reason. ||152|| Nor did
this proud and careless one say to me, "I did not know, therefore forgive me,"
when I arrived. ||153|| He who is not able to conquer the earth-dwellers, how
can he conquer the aerial beings, who are skilled in various arts? ||154||
Therefore, I will first subdue the arrogant earth-dwellers. Then, in due course,
I will subdue Indra, the King of the aerial beings. ||155|| Now that I have
subdued him, it is only right to release him. What more can be said, when you,
whose vision is only for the virtuous, are giving your command? ||156|| Then
Indrajit, the son of Ravana, said, "Well spoken, O Lord! Who, except a wise king
like you, can know how to release him?" ||157|| Then, at the command of Ravana,
Maricha, the minister, brought Sahasrarashmi to the assembly, with officers,
with naked swords in their hands. ||158|| Sahasrarashmi bowed at the feet of his
father and sat down on the ground. Ravana, without anger, spoke to him with
great respect. ||159|| "From today, you are my fourth brother. Since you are
very powerful, I will conquer Indra, the king who mocks Indra, with your help."
||160|| "I will give you, for your service, the younger sister of Mandodari,
Swayamprabha. O beautiful one, what you have done is proof to me." ||161||
Sahasrarashmi said, "Damn this fleeting kingdom of mine! The objects of
enjoyment, which seem pleasant at first, are later filled with sorrow and fear."

236 Padmapurana I curse this heaven from which there is inevitable fall. I curse
this body, the receptacle of suffering. I curse myself, who has been cheated for
a long time by evil deeds. ||163|| Now I will do that which will prevent me from
falling into the ocean of existence. I am very tired of wandering in paths that
are extremely painful. ||164|| Ravana said in reply, "O noble one! Renunciation
is becoming for old men, but you are still in your youth." ||165|| Sahasrarashmi
interrupted Ravana and said, "Death does not have such discrimination that it
only takes the old and not the young. This body, like a cloud in the autumn
season, is suddenly destroyed." ||166|| "Ravana, if there were any essence in
pleasures, then my father, who was a holder of excellent wisdom, would not have
renounced them." ||167|| Having said this, he handed over the kingdom to his son
with firm determination. Ravana, seeking forgiveness, allowed his father
Shatabahu to take renunciation. ||168|| Sahasrarashmi had earlier told his
friend, the king of Ayodhya, Anaranya, "When I take the Digambara renunciation,
I will inform you." Anaranya had also said the same to Sahasrarashmi. So,
according to this agreement, Sahasrarashmi sent men to inform Anaranya.
||169-170|| When the men told Anaranya about Sahasrarashmi's renunciation, his
eyes filled with tears. Remembering the virtues of that great man, he wept for a
long time. ||171|| When his sorrow subsided, the wise Anaranya said, "Ravana has
come to him, as if a brother in the guise of an enemy." ||172|| "He is Ravana,
who, being extremely kind, has freed this man-like bird, who was trapped in the
cage of wealth and was deluded by worldly pleasures for a long time." ||173||
"The king of Mahishmati, Sahasrarashmi, is blessed, who, taking refuge in the
boat of right knowledge, which was created by Ravana, wants to cross the ocean
of existence." ||174|| "What is there to ask about his fulfillment, who has
renounced the sin of the kingdom, which gives immense suffering in the end, and
has attained the vows ordained by the Jinas?" ||175|| 1. Suviyogena b. |

## The Tenth Chapter  **237**  Anaranaya, filled with anxiety, entrusted the
kingdom's wealth to his son and became a Muni, accompanied by his eldest son.
||176||  **177**  A mind is attained to the highest good by any means, whether
by a noble deed, a cause, or an enemy, but not by a base deed. ||177||  **178**
He who engages another's mind in good is truly his friend, but he who engages
another's mind in objects of enjoyment is his true enemy. ||178||  **179**  He
who meditates on the thousand-rayed one, and hears the story of King Anaranaya,
endowed with the wealth of the conduct of a Shraman, attains purity like the
sun. ||179||  Thus ends the tenth chapter of the Padmacharita, narrated by the
Acharya Ravishena, known as the Arsha, describing the initiation of King

## The Eleventh Chapter  **Thus, the Jain King Ravana, who had subdued all the
human kings, heard of them and bowed down to all of them.** (1) **Surrounded by
the kings he had subdued and honored, he saw the earth filled with prosperous
cities and, like a righteous Chakravarti, he toured the land.** (2) **He was
surrounded by people of various origins, shapes, adorned with various ornaments,
with diverse manners and riding various vehicles.** (3) **He had the dilapidated
Jain temples renovated and performed the worship of the Jina, the Lord of Lords,
with great devotion.** (4) **He destroyed the wicked humans who were hostile to
the Jain faith, and with compassion, he filled the poor with wealth.** (5) **He
worshipped with affection those who were pure in their right faith, and he bowed
down to the ascetics, even those who only wore the Jain symbol.** (6) **Like the
sun in the Uttarayana, radiating unbearable heat, he set out towards the north,
his own glory radiating.** (7) **Then, Ravana heard that the king of Rajapura
was very powerful, arrogant, and never bowed down to anyone.** (8) **He was
wicked from birth, deluded by the worldly path, and had committed the great sin
of Yajna Diksha, which involves the destruction of living beings.** (9)
**Hearing the sound of the Yajna, King Shrenik asked Gautam Ganadhar, "Oh, Lord,
let the story of Ravana wait. I want to know the origin of this Yajna, in which
wicked people are engaged in the destruction of living beings."** (10-11) **The
Ganadhar replied, "Oh, Shrenik, listen, you have asked a very good question.
Many people are deluded by this Yajna."** (12)

The Eleventh Chapter  231. In Ayodhya city, Yayaati, the ornament of the
Ikshvaku dynasty, was the king, and his queen was Surakanta. ||13|| They had a
son named Vasu. When he was fit for learning, he was entrusted to the guru,
Kshirakadambaka. Kshirakadambaka's wife was named Svastimati. ||14|| One day,
Kshirakadambaka, who was well-versed in all the scriptures, was teaching the
Aranyakashastra to his disciples, Narada and others, in the forest. ||15|| At
that time, a group of Charanas, who were traveling through the sky, were present
there. One of them, a compassionate Muni, said, "One of these four beings will
go to hell." Hearing this, Kshirakadambaka was greatly frightened. ||16-17||
Then, he sent his three disciples, Narada, Parvata, and Vasu, to their
respective homes. They were happy to go, like calves released from their
tethers. ||18|| When Parvata reached home alone, his mother, Svastimati, asked
him, "Son, where is your father? Why have you come alone?" ||19|| Parvata
replied to his mother, "He said he would come later." Svastimati waited for her
husband's arrival, and the day passed. ||20|| When the day ended and darkness
enveloped everything, he still did not come. Svastimati, overwhelmed with grief,
fell to the ground. ||21|| She lamented like a cuckoo, "Alas, I am unfortunate,
abandoned by my husband!" ||22|| "Has my husband been killed by some wicked
person? Or has he gone to a foreign land for some reason?" ||23|| "Or, being
skilled in all the scriptures, has he embraced renunciation, abandoned all
attachments, and taken to the life of a mendicant?" ||24|| As she lamented, the
night passed. In the morning, Parvata went to search for his father. ||25||
After searching for several days, Parvata saw his father, a Muni, in a garden on
the bank of a river. He was sitting humbly near his guru, surrounded by his
disciples. ||26|| Seeing him from afar, Parvata was overjoyed. He approached his
father and said, "Father, my mother, Nivritti, is waiting for you." ||27||

240 Padmapurana Then, knowing for sure that her husband would not return, she
was overcome with sorrow. She beat her breasts with both hands and cried out
loud. ||28|| Hearing this account, Narada, the devotee of Dharma, came to see
his teacher, overwhelmed with grief. ||29|| Seeing him, she beat her breasts and
cried even more. It is natural for sorrow to increase in the presence of loved
ones. ||30|| Narada said, "Mother, why are you grieving in vain? Your grief will
not bring back the pure-minded Guru now." ||31|| "He has been blessed by his
good deeds, and knowing the impermanence of life, he has become eager to perform
austerities." ||32|| Thus, comforted by Narada, her sorrow gradually subsided.
Sometimes she would criticize her husband, saying that he had left her helpless,
a weak woman, and sometimes she would praise his virtues, thinking how high his
detachment was. Thus, criticizing and praising, she remained at home. ||33|| It
was from this incident that Yayaati, the knower of truth, entrusted the kingdom
to Vasu and became a great ascetic. ||34|| Vasu became a well-established king,
renowned throughout the earth. His throne was situated on a large slab of
crystal, and it was said that Vasu, by the power of truth, was situated in the
sky without any support. ||35|| Then, one day, Narada and the mountain had a
discussion about the true meaning of the scriptures. ||36|| Narada, the
omniscient and all-seeing, said, "The Arhant Bhagavan has described two types of
Dharma, Anuvrata and Mahavrata, based on their subtle and grand distinctions."
||37|| "To be free from the five sins of violence, falsehood, stealing, lust,
and attachment is called a Vrata. This Vrata is accompanied by five different
intentions for each Vrata." ||38|| "Those who are able to renounce these sins
completely in all places are called Mahavratins, and the rest, who live in
homes, are called Anuvratins." ||39|| "The Jina Bhagavan has described one Vrata
for householders, called Atithisambhaga, which is of many types, based on the
differences in the recipient, etc." ||40||  Mother, my father has been tricked
by the naked ascetics and their devotees and has become naked. ||27||

## Eleventh Chapter  The meaning of the phrase "Ajairyastavyam" is related to
compassion. This has been explained by the wise sages, who are the unravelers of
the knots of the scriptures. ||41||  Aja refers to the old rice that does not
sprout even when the cause is present. It is decided that such rice should be
used for the sacrifice. ||42||  Parvata, being arrogant, said that Aja refers to
animals, and therefore, their killing should be done, and this is called
sacrifice. ||43||  Nārada, angered by this, said to the wicked Parvata, "Do not
speak like this, because by speaking like this, you will fall into a terrible
hell." ||44||  Asserting the strength of his side, Nārada also vowed, "Let us
both go to King Vasu, and the one who is defeated will have his tongue cut off."
||45||  "The time to meet King Vasu has passed today, so this matter will be
decided tomorrow," saying this, Parvata went to his mother. ||46||  The proud
Parvata explained the root cause of the conflict to his mother. In response, his
mother said, "O son! You have spoken falsely. ||47||  "I have heard from your
father, who explained it many times, that Aja refers to the rice that does not
sprout." ||48||  "You have gone to another country and become a meat-eater, and
out of pride, you have spoken this falsehood. This will cause you sorrow."
||49||  "O son! Your tongue will surely be cut off. What will I, a helpless
woman, do without my husband and son?" ||50||  At that moment, she remembered
that King Vasu had once asked her for a guru-dakshina (gift to the teacher), and
she had kept it with him as a deposit. Remembering this, she immediately went to
King Vasu, filled with anxiety. ||51||  Thinking, "This is our teacher," King
Vasu treated her with great respect, bowed to her, and when she sat comfortably
on the seat, he asked her with folded hands, ||52||  "O teacher! Please tell me
why you have come. I will fulfill your wish immediately. Why do you look so
sad?" ||53||  In response, Swastimati said, "O son! I am constantly in sorrow.

242 There are two types of relationships: one based on sexual desire and the
other based on scriptures. I consider the latter to be superior, as it is free
from impurities. ||55|| Therefore, you are my son, as you are my husband's
disciple. Seeing your prosperity brings me joy. ||56|| Son, you had once said,
"Accept the Dakshina." I had replied, "I will accept it later." Remember this.
||57|| Kings who are dedicated to protecting the earth always speak the truth.
Those who are dedicated to protecting living beings are truly called Rishis.
||58|| You are known for your truthfulness in the world, so give me that
Dakshina. Upon hearing this, the king, with utmost humility, bowed his head and
said, ||59|| "Mother, I am willing to do even the most despicable act at your
command. Tell me what is in your heart, do not think otherwise." ||60|| Then,
Swastimati narrated the entire story of the dispute between Narada and Parvata,
and urged him to support her son's side, even though it was false. ||61||
Although King Vasu knew the true meaning of the scriptures, Swastimati, through
repeated persuasion, kept him on her side. In this way, the king, blinded by his
foolish adherence to truth, accepted her words. ||62|| After this, Swastimati,
filled with joy, showered King Vasu with many blessings and returned home.
||63|| On the next day, early in the morning, Narada and Parvata went to King
Vasu. Many people, filled with curiosity, accompanied them. ||64|| People from
four different regions, various types of people, Samantas, and ministers quickly
arrived at the place of the debate. ||65|| Then, a great dispute arose between
Narada and Parvata in the presence of the righteous. Narada argued that "Aj"
means seedless rice, while Parvata argued that "Aj" means animal. ||66|| When
the dispute could not be settled, they asked King Vasu, "O King! Tell us what
your Guru, Kshirakadambaka, had said on this matter. You are known for your
truthfulness." ||67|| In response, King Vasu said, "Parvata had said...

The passage you've provided is a portion of Jain literature, written in a
mixture of Sanskrit and Hindi, recounting a narrative involving themes of
morality, the consequences of actions, and the concept of dharma (righteousness)
and adharma (unrighteousness). Here's the English translation preserving the
Sanskrit words:  ---  243  The eleventh chapter speaks of how the realm (loka)
became aware of the crystal (sphatika) in the sky. There was a throne
(singhasana) that was situated there; then it was said: "Due to your false
capability, O Vasu, the throne has descended. This is suitable in light of your
true nature" (paramartha-nivedanam). Then, filled with delusion (moha), he again
spoke. Just then he entered the earth, immediately accompanied by the throne
(singhasana) (71).   Plagued by terrible sin (maha-papa) due to promoting the
dharma of violence (hinsa-dharma), he fell into extreme darkness (tama) and
entered the seventh earth (prithivi), which is known for its severe agony (72).
Then, loud cries of "Alas! Alas!" resounded, creating a significant uproar in
the realm of beings (73). Narada had attained reverence from giving teachings on
non-violence (ahimsa), and thus, this expression emerged from the mouths of all:
"Where there is dharma, there is victory" (74).  The sinful mountain (parvata),
struck by the punitive scorn (danda) in the world, became despondent and caused
the suffering body to suffer extremely (75). Finally, having caused death, the
wicked (rakshasa) who held great valor remembered the humiliation and strife he
faced in the previous life (76).   He reflected, “People have caused me great
disgrace previously; therefore, I will take a revenge that brings pain” (77). "I
shall create deceitful (dambha-racita) scriptures and perform actions that lead
the deluded people into terrible realms (naraka) (78).”  Thereafter, that
rakshasa assumed the guise of a human, wore the sacred thread (yajnopavita) on
his left shoulder, and carried a water pot (kamandalu) and garland (akshamalā)
among other items (79).   Thus, he began wandering about the earth, intent on
instigating acts of violence (hinsa-karman), reciting an extremely unfriendly
(amangalak) tone of the fearsome scriptures (80). He was inherently cruel and
constantly engaged in the entrapment of ignorant ascetics (tapasya) and
brahmanas (81).   Afterward, those foolish beings who were destined to suffer in
the future began to align with him, just like moths (shalabha) drawn to the
light (82).  ---  This translation retains the essence of the original text,
highlighting the themes of delusion, moral downfall, and the consequences of
one's actions, as rooted in Jain philosophy.

---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, I myself declared the purpose of the Yajna. I am Brahma,
who created this world of moving and unmoving beings. I created animals for the
sake of the Yajna, out of my own grace. The Yajna is the source of prosperity
and heaven, therefore the killing in the Yajna is not killing. In the Sautrāmaṇi
Yajna, drinking of liquor is not a sin, and in the Gosava Yajna, the use of an
agamya (unapproachable) woman is permissible. In the Matṛmedha Yajna, the mother
should be killed, and in the Pitṛmedha Yajna, the father should be killed. This
should be done within the vedi (altar), and there is no fault in it. The Juhūka,
a deity, should be satisfied with offerings of ghee, placed on the back of a
tortoise, while chanting "Svaha" with great effort. If a tortoise is not
available, then a pure twice-born man, with a bald head and a yellow complexion,
should be immersed in pure water up to his mouth, leaving only his head above
the water, resembling a tortoise. A blazing fire should be kindled on his head
and offerings should be made into it. All that has been, is, and will be, is the
Purusha, the Lord of immortality, who lives on food. Since there is only one
Purusha, who kills whom? Therefore, kill beings in the Yajna as you please. The
Yajna performer should eat the flesh of those beings, because it is purified by
the Yajna and is made for the purpose of the gods. Thus, showing such extremely
sinful acts, that Rakshasa made beings inclined towards Yajna on earth. Then,
believing his words, those who entered the land of the Yajna, seeking happiness,
were bound by him like logs of wood, and he flew up into the sky. At that time,
their bodies trembled with fear, their pupils rolled, and he turned them upside
down, so that their thighs were on their backs and their necks were on their
feet.

Eleventh Chapter  Then they cried out, "O Visvarodar, why are you angry with us?
Why are you trying to kill us?" ||97|| "Please be merciful and release us, we
are innocent, O great and powerful God. We are all your devotees and will obey
all your commands." ||98|| Then the Rakshasa said to them, "Just as the animals
you killed go to heaven, so too will you go to heaven after being killed by me."
||99|| Saying this, he threw some of them into another island where there was no
human presence. He threw others into the vast ocean, and some into the midst of
cruel animals like lions. ||100|| He spun some of them around and around,
smashing them against the rocky ground, making a sound like a washerman beating
clothes. ||101|| They were all in a state of agony and fear of death. They
remembered their parents, children, and brothers, and then met their end.
||102|| Those who remained were deluded by the false scriptures and increased
the violence of the Yajna shown to them by the Rakshasa. ||103|| Those who do
not perform this terrible Yajna of violence do not go to the terrible hell that
brings great suffering. ||104|| The origin of this Yajna of violence that I have
described to you was a king named Shrenik, who was wise and the son of Ratna
Shrava. ||105|| Then Ravana arrived at the royal city, which was like heaven.
Outside the city, a king named Marutvan was sitting in the Yajna hall. ||106|| A
famous Brahmin named Samvarta, who was well-versed in the religion of violence,
was the chief priest of the Yajna and was giving instructions to the king
according to the scriptures. ||107|| All the Brahmins on earth were invited to
this Yajna, and they came with their wives, children, and other relatives,
driven by greed. ||108|| The entire Yajna was filled with the sounds of
auspicious chants and the eager faces of those who were hoping for rewards. The
earth trembled with the power of the Yajna. ||109||

246 In the Padma Purana, it is said that many animals were tied there, their
hearts filled with sorrow. Hundreds of boars were bound, their bellies heaving
with fear. ||110|| Meanwhile, Narada, traveling through the sky at will, saw a
gathering of people on the back of a mountain. ||111|| Seeing this, he was
filled with wonder, his mind bewildered, and his body moved with curiosity.
||112|| He thought, "Whose is this excellent city? Whose army is this? And whose
people, like the ocean in size, are standing here?" ||113|| "I have seen many
cities, many crowds of people, and many armies, but never such a gathering of
people." ||114|| Driven by curiosity, he descended from the sky. For it was his
nature to be curious and to see. ||115|| The king, Shrenik, asked, "O Lord, who
is this Narada? What is his origin, and what are his qualities?" ||116|| The
head of the assembly replied, "O Shrenik, there was a Brahmin named Brahmaruchi,
and his wife was named Kurmi." ||117|| "That Brahmin, being a devotee, lived in
the forest, subsisting on fruits and roots. His wife lived with him, and he
conceived a child in her womb." ||118|| "Then, one day, the liberated sages, who
were devoted to self-control, were traveling somewhere. By chance, they came to
that place." ||119|| "They rested for a while in that hermitage, which was a
place of peace. There, they saw the Brahmin couple, whose appearance was good,
but whose actions were blameworthy." ||120|| "Seeing the woman, whose body was
pale, whose breasts were large, who was weak, who was exhausted from the burden
of pregnancy, and who was breathing like a serpent, the great-souled sages, who
knew the nature of the world, were filled with compassion and decided to teach
them Dharma." ||121-122|| "The eldest of them, a wise sage, spoke in sweet
words. He said, 'It is a pity to see how these creatures are controlled by their
karma.' ||123|| "O ascetic, you have abandoned your family and your Dharma,
hoping to cross the ocean of existence. What is your soul doing in this forest?"

## Eleventh Chapter  **247**  A wandering ascetic is born, what is the
difference between him and a householder? He has merely changed his attire, but
his conduct is contrary to his vows. (125)  Just as humans do not eat vomited
food, so too, the wise do not desire what they have renounced. (126)  A
renunciate who, after renouncing women, indulges in them again, is a sinner and
will become a wolf in a terrible forest after death. (127)  One who, while
engaged in all kinds of activities, indulges in unrighteous conduct and is
intoxicated with pride, and yet considers himself initiated, is utterly deluded.
(128)  What kind of renunciation is that of one who is consumed by jealousy and
lust, whose vision is evil, whose soul is corrupt, and who is engaged in all
kinds of activities? Tell me. (129)  One who is proud with an evil eye, a
renunciate who is addicted to sensual pleasures, and who claims to be an
ascetic, is a liar. How can he be a renunciate? (130)  One who enjoys
comfortable seating and movement, and whose mind is always attached to food and
clothing, and yet considers himself a Siddha, is a fool who deceives himself.
(131)  Just as one who escapes from a burning house, but then throws himself
back into it, is considered foolish. (132)  Or, just as a bird, having escaped
from a cage through a hole, returns to it again due to ignorance, is foolish.
(133)  Similarly, one who, after becoming a renunciate, falls under the sway of
the senses, is condemned in the world and does not attain his own good. (134)
Only a Muni, whose mind is one-pointed and free from all attachments, can
meditate on the true essence. Not those who are beginners like you. (135)  From
the association of attachments, arise the passions of attachment and aversion in
a being. From attachment arises lust, and from aversion, the destruction of
living beings. (136)  One who is overwhelmed by lust and anger, whose mind is
clouded by delusion, and who is confused about right and wrong actions, cannot
have a discerning mind. (137)  Why have you, abandoning your relatives,
subjected yourself to hardship in this forest? (124)

248 Whoever does anything in this world, earns karma, and his journey in this
terrible ocean of samsara never ends. ||138|| Knowing these faults arising from
association, the wise, controlling themselves by themselves, attain dispassion.
||139|| Thus, being instructed by the words of the ultimate truth, the Brahmin
Brahmaruchi, freed from delusion, attained the Shramanī initiation. ||140||
Being free from attachment, he, with great dispassion, happily wandered with his
Guru, who was dear to him. ||141|| The Kurmi, with a pure mind, also realized
that the cycle of birth and death of a being is due to attachment. Knowing this,
she renounced sinful deeds and immersed herself in pure conduct. ||142||
Abandoning the association of the wrong path, she became devoted to the Jina and
shone like a lioness in the forest, even though she was without a husband.
||143|| In the tenth month, the patient woman gave birth to a good son. Seeing
the child, the Kurmi, who knew the workings of karma, thought. ||144|| That
since the great sages have said that this association is the cause of
misfortune, I will abandon this association, that is, the company of the son,
and do what is good for the soul. ||145|| This child will also experience the
good or bad fruits of the law of karma that he has earned in his previous
births. ||146|| The deeds done by oneself protect one in the dense forest, the
ocean, or in the cage of enemies, not others. ||147|| When the time comes, even
a being who is in the womb of his mother, being subject to his own karma, is
taken away by death. ||148|| Knowing this truth, the ascetic, with a detached
mind, abandoned the child in the forest. Then, with great urgency, she sought
refuge in the city of Anjaloka, with the patient Aryā Indumālini, the beautiful
and virtuous one. ||149-150||

called Jṛmbhaka, who were bowing down. || 151 || He was taken by them with
compassion and nurtured with love. He was taught all the scriptures, including
the secrets. || 152 || Having become learned, he obtained the knowledge that

In the Padma Purana, The Ojain man said, "What is this that is presented, seen
by all-knowing ones, as the cause of suffering?" ||163|| Sanvarta, angered,
said, "Oh, your extreme foolishness! You speak in a way that is completely
unconnected and without reason." ||164|| "Your opinion, that there is some all-
knowing being free from attachment, is not true. Because of the existence of
individuality and other things, that being is not like that." ||165|| "Words
spoken by impure doers, those with attachment and aversion, are polluted. And
there is no one different from them, because there is no proof of such a being."
||166|| "Therefore, the Veda, which is not created by any doer, is the proof for
the things beyond the senses. In it, the karma of the three varnas (castes) and
the yajna (sacrifice) are described." ||167|| "The eternal dharma, called
'Apuurva', is revealed through the yajna. It gives the fruit, born from
desirable objects, in heaven." ||168|| "The killing of animals in the middle of
the vedi (altar) is not a cause of sin, because it is described in the
scriptures. Therefore, one should perform yajna and other rituals without
worry." ||169|| "The self-born Brahma created the animals for the sake of the
yajna. Therefore, there is no fault in destroying them for the purpose for which
they were created." ||170|| Hearing this, Narada said, "You have spoken all
falsehood. Listen, your soul is polluted by the wrong understanding of the
scriptures, that is why you have spoken like this." ||171|| "You say that there
is no all-knowing being. If there is no all-knowing being of any kind, then why
have you yourself spoken of three kinds of all-knowing beings: the one who knows
words, the one who knows meaning, and the one who knows the mind? You are
contradicted by your own words." ||172|| "If you say that there is the one who
knows words and the one who knows the mind, but there is no one who knows
meaning, then that is not right. Because in all things, like cows, etc., all
three, words, meaning, and mind, are seen together." ||173|| "If there is
absolutely no meaning, then where will the mind and words stand? That is, what
will be the support for that kind of mind, and how will that kind of word be
spoken? And that kind of meaning will be obtained by the contradiction of the
mind and the word." ||174||

## Eleventh Chapter 251  The term "omniscient" applied to the Buddha is a
secondary usage, based on qualities. It is dependent on the primary, just as the
sound of a lion in Chaitra is dependent on the actual lion. ||175||  This
inference contradicts your claim that the Buddha is not omniscient. In our view,
the complete absence of omniscience is not accepted. ||176||  "Where does this
omniscient, who pervades the earth with his glory, reside?" To this question, it
is said that he resides in the divine Brahma-pura, with a soul as pure as the
sky. ||177||  Your scripture also contradicts your claim. If the Buddha were
completely devoid of omniscience, why would your scripture mention his location,
etc.? And thus, when the object of the argument is established in multiple ways,
i.e., established in some way, it becomes a valid argument for us, because this
is what we claim. ||178||  The argument you have presented for the absence of
omniscience is based on the concept of "speech." Speech can be of three types:
completely inappropriate speech, appropriate speech, and general speech.
Completely inappropriate speech is not valid, because it is not established
against the opponent. If you take speech according to the Syadvada, then your
argument becomes invalid, because it would establish the validity of a speaker
without any flaws. Secondly, we do not accept the interpretation of the Vedas by
Jaimini, etc., as valid. They, like Devadatta, are also flawed speakers based on
the argument of speech. Therefore, your argument based on speech becomes
contradictory, as it proves the opposite meaning. ||179-180||  And the teachings
given by Prajapati, etc., cannot be considered evidence, because they are also
like Devadatta, etc., being influenced by attachment and aversion. And any
scripture coming from such attached and averse individuals will also be flawed.
Therefore, the absence of a flawless scripture is established in your view.
||181||  One who knows one thing knows all things in their true form. Therefore,
the example you have given to prove the absence of omniscience is flawed by you,
because since he knows one thing, he knows everything is established. ||182||
Furthermore, according to your view, there is no person who speaks completely
appropriate words as an example. Therefore, you should show the absence of the
means in the absence of the object in the example. Just as you show the
occurrence of the object in the example of analogy by establishing the
pervasiveness of the analogy, similarly, you should show the occurrence of the
absence in the example of absence by establishing the pervasiveness of the
absence. Only then can the object be established, otherwise not. ||183||  And in
your view, hearing about an unseen object and the evidence coming from the
scriptures...

## Padma Purana  **Verse 185:** What is equal to omniscience in opposition to
eloquence? If there is a possibility of omniscience, then the speaker would be
even more eloquent.  **Verse 186:** What does one who does not know speak? He is
a fool with a confused mind. Without the absence of difference and non-
difference, there would be no means of knowing.  **Verse 187:** Our view is that
just as the impurities of gold and other metals are completely destroyed, so too
are ignorance and the impurities of attachment, aversion, etc., destroyed in a
person due to a cause. The one in whom they are destroyed is called omniscient.
**Verse 188:** According to our doctrine, the qualities (dharma) of substances
are necessarily dependent on their opposites, just as the blue quality of a
lotus flower implies that there are also lotuses that are not blue. Similarly,
the quality of being non-omniscient, which you attribute to humans, proves that
there are also humans who are not non-omniscient, i.e., omniscient. In reality,
a quality is meaningful only when there is both possibility and variation, as
stated elsewhere: "A quality is meaningful due to possibility and variation.
Fire is never characterized by coldness, nor by heat." That is, a quality is
meaningful only because of possibility and variation. Coldness is not attributed
to fire because it is not possible, and heat is not attributed to fire because
it is always hot. Similarly, according to your doctrine, if humans were always
non-omniscient, then attributing the quality of non-omniscience to them would be
meaningless. It is meaningful only when a human is considered omniscient.
**Verse 189:** The statement "There is no creator of the Vedas" cannot be proven
due to the lack of logic, i.e., it does not fit with the concept of non-
creation. On the other hand, there are many reasons to believe that "The Vedas
have a creator." Just as visible objects like pots and pans have a cause, so too
are there many reasons to believe that "The Vedas have a creator."  **Verse
190:** Since the Vedas are in the form of words and sentences, and are filled
with the meaning of injunctions and prohibitions, they have a creator. Just as a
poem by Maitra is created because it is in the form of words and sentences, so
too are the Vedas created because they are in the form of words and sentences.
**Verse 191:** It is heard in the world that the Vedas originated from Brahma,
Prajapati, and other beings. This well-known fact cannot be refuted.  **Verse
192:** Perhaps you think that Brahma, etc., are not the creators of the Vedas...

## Eleventh Chapter  **What would a perfect knower do other than explain the
scriptures?**  Because the meaning of a perfect knower is that their statement
is proof, they would not explain the scriptures in any other way. (193)  **The
fourfold division of castes is not justified without reason.**  The knowledge of
the specific body (caste) is not due to the Vedic verses or the fire rituals, as
it is claimed. (194)  **The difference in castes is seen wherever there is a
difference in the body.**  Just as there is a difference in the body of a human,
elephant, donkey, cow, horse, etc. (195)  **A man of one caste does not
impregnate a woman of another caste.**  Except for the Brahmanas, etc., where it
is seen. This proves that there is no difference in castes among the Brahmanas,
etc. (196)  **If you say that a donkey can impregnate a mare, then this argument
is not valid.**  Because the donkey and the horse are not entirely different
castes, as there is similarity in their bodies, such as having hooves. (197)
**Or, if you say that they are different castes, then their offspring would be
different.**  For example, the offspring of a donkey and a mare would be neither
a horse nor a donkey, but a mule. However, such a difference in offspring is not
seen among the Brahmanas, etc. This proves that the caste system is based on
qualities, not on birth. (198)  **Furthermore, the statement that Brahmanas are
born from Brahma's mouth, Kshatriyas from his arms, Vaishyas from his thighs,
and Shudras from his feet is baseless.**  Such a statement is only suitable for
one's own home, not for everyone. (199)  **The Brahmanhood of Rishi Shrunga,
etc., is attributed to their qualities, not to their birth in a Brahman
family.** (200)  **Because of the growth of all qualities, Lord Rishabhadeva is
called Brahma.**  And those good men who are his devotees are called Brahmanas.
(201)  **Kshatriyas are called so because they protect from destruction
(kshatra).**  Vaishyas are called so because they engage in trade and crafts
(shilpa). And those who are quick to learn from the scriptures (shruta) are
called Shudras. (202)  **If the speaker is not the doer, but only the speaker,
then they will be influenced by attachment and aversion.** (192)  **If they are
perfect knowers, then how would they explain the scriptures in any other way?**
Because their statement is proof, they would not explain the scriptures in any
other way. This proves the existence of perfect knowers. (193)

---------------------------
In the Padma Purana:  No caste is inherently blameworthy, virtues are the cause
of well-being. Even a Chandala who observes vows is considered a Brahman by the
gods.  A learned person sees equality in a Brahman, a cow, an elephant, a dog,
and a Chandala.  The four varnas (Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra) and the
distinctions like Chandala, etc., are all known in the world due to differences
in conduct.  You said that the *apūrva* (unseen) dharma is manifested through
sacrifice. This is not correct, because *apūrva* dharma is eternal like the sky,
how can it be manifested? And if it is manifested, then it will not be eternal,
but impermanent like a pot.  Just as the knowledge of form is the fruit after
the manifestation of a lamp, similarly, the fruit in the form of heaven, etc.,
should occur only after the manifestation of *apūrva* dharma. But this is not
the case.  You said that the killing of animals in the middle of the vedi
(altar) is not a cause of sin because it is ordained by the scriptures. This is
incorrect, listen to the reason.  Firstly, it is not proven that the Vedas are
scriptures. A scripture is that which teaches the good of the whole world like a
mother.  It is not appropriate to speak of atonement for a deed that is
blameless. But atonement is mentioned in this sacrificial killing, therefore it
is blameworthy. Here is a description of that atonement.  He who performs the
Soma sacrifice, which is symbolic of the Soma, the king of the gods, is
considered to kill the Soma. The *dakshina* (offering) for this sacrifice is one
hundred and twelve cows.  Out of these one hundred and twelve *dakshinas*, one
hundred *dakshinas* purify the Soma, the king of the gods, ten *dakshinas* are
for the satisfaction of the vital breaths, the eleventh *dakshina* is for the
soul, and the twelfth *dakshina* is only a *dakshina*.  The other *dakshinas*
are for the removal of faults.  People who engage in the business of
manufacturing goods are called Vaishyas, and those who are far from the *shruti*
(sacred texts) are called Shudras.

## Eleventh Chapter 255 'And if the animal, not having been consecrated, cries
out or strikes its chest with its feet, O Fire, free me from all the sins
arising from this.' ||21||  Thus, many atonements for sins have been mentioned.
But there is a contradiction in this matter with other Agamas. ||215|| Just as
the killing done by a hunter is the cause of suffering and therefore leads to
bondage, so too, the killing of animals in the Vedas, being the cause of
suffering, is also the cause of bondage. ||216|| To say that Brahma created the
world is also not true, because upon reflection, such a statement appears as
useless as dry grass. ||217|| We ask, if Brahma is already accomplished, what is
the purpose of his creating the world? If you say that he creates the world for
amusement, then where is his accomplishment? Just as a child who desires
amusement is not accomplished, so too, Brahma, who desires amusement, will be
called unaccomplished. ||218|| Then why doesn't Brahma attain pleasure without
other things? Why does he have to create the world? Besides this, another
question arises: when Brahma creates the world, what are the supporting
instruments, objects, etc.? ||219|| Furthermore, not all people in the world are
alike; some are seen to be happy and some are seen to be unhappy. From this, it
must be assumed that some people are benefactors of Brahma and some are
malefactors. He makes those who are benefactors happy and those who are
malefactors unhappy. ||220|| To avoid all this contradiction, if it is assumed
that God is not accomplished, then he will not be called God because he is
subject to karma, just as you are not God because you are subject to karma.
||221|| Just as chariots, houses, etc., are considered to be created by the
effort of an intelligent human being because they are endowed with a specific
form, so too, lotuses, etc., should be considered to be created by the effort of
an intelligent human being because they are endowed with a specific form. "The
one whose intelligence creates all this is God." This inference leads to the
establishment of God as the creator. But this is not correct, because the
argument of the absolutist is not appropriate. ||223||   ##  The business of
other offerings is to remove sins. ||212-213||

## Translation:  **256**  It is not true that chariots and other objects are
created solely by the effort of a wise human being.  Because the materials like
wood, etc., which are present in chariots, etc., are the ones that give rise to
the form of a chariot, etc.  **[224]**  Just as a carpenter, etc., has to endure
hardship in making chariots, etc., similarly, God would have to endure hardship
in creating the universe.  This would hinder his happiness.  In reality, the one
you call God is just a name.  **[225]**  Another question arises: Is God
embodied or disembodied?  If he is disembodied, then the creation of material
objects is not possible.  If he is embodied, then who created his body with its
specific form?  If he created it himself, then why don't other objects create
themselves?  If it is assumed that he was created by another God, then the
question arises: Who created that other God's body?  This leads to an infinite
regress.  To avoid this contradiction, if it is assumed that God has no body,
then how can he be the creator of the universe, being disembodied?  Just as the
sky, being disembodied, is not the creator of the universe, similarly, God,
being disembodied, cannot be the creator of the universe.  If God is considered
to be a creator like a carpenter, then he would be embodied, not disembodied.
**[226-228]**  And what you said that Brahma created animals for the purpose of
sacrifice, if this is true, then why are animals used for carrying loads, etc.?
This creates a contradiction.  Not only a contradiction, but it would be
considered theft.  **[229]**  This proves that due to the karmas acquired
through passions, etc., all beings experience diverse conditions in the endless
ocean of existence.  **[230]**  Does karma come first or the body?  It is not
right to ask such a question because the relationship between the two has been
going on since time immemorial, like the relationship between a seed and a tree.
**[231]**  It is also not right to say that the relationship between karma and
the body is eternal, because just as the absence of a tree is seen when the seed
is destroyed, similarly, the absence of a body is also seen when karma is
destroyed.  **[232]**  Therefore, some hateful person, by performing evil deeds,
has created a false scripture and propagated this sacrificial practice.
**[233]**  You have been born in a noble family and are a wise human being,
therefore, refrain from this evil practice, like the work of hunters.  **[234]**
If killing beings were the cause of attaining heaven, then this world would
become empty in a few days.  **[235]**  **[222-223]**  Upon reflection, it
becomes clear that it is not true that all objects like chariots, etc., are
created solely by the effort of a wise human being.  Because the materials like
wood, etc., which are present in chariots, etc., are the ones that give rise to
the form of a chariot, etc.  **[224]**

Eleventh Chapter 257. What is the benefit of attaining heaven, if one has to
fall from it again? The happiness derived from external objects is mixed with
sorrow and is also small in quantity. ||236|| If humans go to heaven by killing
living beings, then why did Vasu fall into hell just by approving of the killing
of living beings? ||237|| Vasu went to hell, the proof of this is that even
today, wicked Brahmanas, who are evil-minded, who do harm to themselves and
others, and who are pleased by the support of their own side, shout loudly, "O
Vasu! Get up, go to heaven," and offer oblations into the fire. If Vasu had not
gone to hell, then what was the need to offer oblations with the above mantra?
||238-239|| Those who killed animals by making them into flour also went to
hell, then what to say about those who kill other animals with an evil
intention? ||240|| Firstly, there is no purpose in the concept of Yajna, i.e.,
it is useless to even think about Yajna. Secondly, even if one has to think
about it, then wise people should not think about such a violent Yajna. ||241||
They should perform Dharma Yajna. The soul is the Yajamana, the body is the
Vedi, contentment is the Saakalya, renunciation is the Homa, the hair on the
head is the Kusa, the protection of living beings is the Dakshina, white
meditation is Pranayama, attaining the Siddha Pada is the fruit, speaking truth
is the Yupa, penance is the Agni, the fickle mind is the Pashu, and the senses
are the Samidhas. One should perform Yajna with all these, this is called Dharma
Yajna. ||242-244|| If you think that Yajna satisfies the Gods, then this is not
correct, because the Gods have divine food available to them as they desire.
||245|| Those who have a pleasing diet of touch, taste, smell, and form, what is
the use of this meat, etc., for them? ||246|| How do the Gods eat meat, which is
born from semen and blood, is impure, is the birthplace of worms, and whose
smell and appearance are both extremely disgusting? They do not eat it at all.
||247|| There are three fires in the body, namely, the fire of knowledge, the
fire of vision, and the fire of the stomach. Wise people should perform the
three fires, namely, Dakshinagni, Garhapatyagni, and Ahavaniyaagni, in these
three fires. ||248|| This world becomes empty. ||235||

Here's the translation of the provided text into English, while retaining the
Sanskrit words:  ---  In the Padma Purana:  If the Suras are sacrificed, they
attain satisfaction through the offerings made in fire. Why do the Devas not
attain satisfaction themselves, but rely on the offerings made by humans? (249)
One who comes from Brahmaloka and consumes the foul-smelling body that is born
of the yoni becomes like a crow, a jackal, or a dog. (250) Moreover, consider
this: the food placed in the mouths of Brahmins, which is drenched with saliva,
eventually goes to a stomach filled with excrement. How can such food satisfy
the Devas residing in heaven? (251) Thus, Narada, radiating the brilliance of
the Devarshi, seems like the sun of many angles, speaking such words that arise
from the knowledge of the scriptures. (252) Surrounded by the Brahmins, he was
shaken by the heavy weight of anger arising from the defeat of the yajaka. Due
to the study of the meaning of the Vedas, their hearts were devoid of
compassion. (253) Their eyes, like serpent's pupils, appeared to all, and,
agitated, they were making a great tumult from all sides. (254) Those Brahmins,
having girded up their loins, prepared to strike Narada with their hands and
feet, just as crows prepare to attack an owl. (255) Then, Narada began to strike
many of them with fist-like cudgels and others with kicks like thunder bolts.
(256) At that time, all Narada's limbs appeared extremely difficult, like
unbearable weapons. He went around and struck many Brahmins. (257) After a long
time of hitting the Brahmins, he became distressed, caught by many wicked
Brahmins who began to attack him all over his body, leading him to a state of
great agitation. (258) Just as a bird bound tightly by a net becomes extremely
distressed and is unable to fly in the sky, Narada found himself in a state of
doubt about his life. (259) In the meantime, a messenger of Ravana arrived and,
seeing Narada being beaten, recognized him. (260) He quickly returned and said
to Ravana, "O Maharaja! The one to whom I was sent as a messenger, sees the king
alone, being attacked by many wicked Brahmins..."  ---   I hope this translation
meets your expectations! If there are any specific sections you would like
further elaboration on, feel free to ask.

The Eleventh Chapter 251 Narada saw the king being attacked by many cruel men,
like a snake being killed by many wasps. 261-262 I was powerless and seeing the
king there, I was terrified, so I came running to tell you this terrible news.
263 Hearing this news, Ravana was filled with anger and, mounting his swift
chariot, he was eager to go to the sacrificial ground. 264 Those who were as
swift as the wind, who had drawn their naked swords from their sheaths, and who
were adorned with the sound of "su-su", were already on their way. 265 In the
blink of an eye, they reached the sacrificial ground. There, those merciful men,
with a mere glance, freed Narada from the cage of his enemies. 266 The cruel men
who were protecting the herd of animals, were freed by them with a mere gesture
of their eyes. 267 The sacrificial posts were broken, the Brahmanas were beaten,
and the animals were released from their bonds. All this caused a great uproar.
268 Those who chanted "Abrahmanyam, Abrahmanyam" were beaten one by one until
they fell to the ground, their bodies lifeless. 269 Ravana's warriors asked the
Brahmanas, "Just as you find sorrow unpleasant and happiness pleasant, so too do
these animals." 270 Just as all beings in the three worlds cherish their lives,
so too should you understand the nature of all creatures. 271 The beating you
have received has caused you this painful state. What then must be the condition
of the animals who have been killed with weapons? 272 O wicked men! You have now
received the fruits of your sins. Bear it, so that you will not do such things
again. 273 Even if Indra himself were to come here with the gods, he would not
be able to protect you while our master is angry. 274 Those who were on
elephants, horses, chariots, in the sky, and on the ground, were all killing the
Brahmanas with their weapons. 275 1. Seeing the king. 2. The sacrificial ground.

260 The Brahmins were crying out, "Abrahmanyam, what a disaster! Oh King, oh
Mataryajnapali, protect us! Oh warriors, spare us, we will not do this again!"
||276|| Thus, they were crying out in misery, like worms, and the warriors were
beating them. ||277|| Seeing the group of Brahmins being beaten, Narada said to
Ravana, ||278|| "Oh King, may you be blessed. I was being killed by these wicked
hunters, and you saved me from them." ||279|| "This was bound to happen, so it
happened. Now, have mercy on them. Let these small creatures live, their lives
are dear to them." ||280|| "Oh King, do you not know how these Kupakhandas were
born? Listen, I will tell you. When the fourth time period of this Avasarpini
Yuga was about to come, Lord Rishabhadeva became the Tirthankara. All beings in
the three worlds bowed to him. He established the Krta Yuga and spread hundreds
of arts." ||281-282|| "When Rishabhadeva was born, the Devas took him to the top
of Mount Mandara and, pleased, anointed him with the water of the Kshiroda
Ocean. He was the bearer of great radiance." ||283|| "The divine story of Lord
Rishabhadeva, which destroys sin, is present throughout the three worlds. Have
you not heard his Purana?" ||284|| "Lord Rishabhadeva, who was affectionate
towards all beings, became the lord of this earth after his childhood. His
qualities were so great that even Indra could not describe them in detail."
||285|| "He abandoned the earth, which was like a woman with high breasts, the
Vindhya and Himachala mountains, whose face was towards the Aryan country, which
was beautiful with rings of cities, whose waist was the ocean, whose hair was
the green forests, whose radiance was enhanced by various jewels, and who was
very skilled. He became a Shraman, a pure soul, for the benefit of the world."

The one who stood for a thousand years, with a body like a thunderbolt, holding
the steady yoga, with long arms, and a matted hair reaching the earth. || 289 ||
He was embraced by his devotees, the fierce kings, like Kacha and others, who
had taken the vow of nakedness. But, afflicted by the severe austerities, they
finally abandoned the vow and took to wearing bark and other things. || 290 ||
Those who did not know the ultimate truth, afflicted by hunger and other
miseries, were content with fruits and other food. It was they who created the
ascetics and others. || 291 || When the Lord Rishabhadeva was near the great
banyan tree, he attained the omniscient knowledge, which illuminates all things.
|| 292 || At that time, the gods worshipped him at that place, and even today,
people follow the same method of worship. That is, the worship of the banyan
tree today originates from the omniscient knowledge and auspiciousness of Lord
Rishabhadeva. || 293 || The gods with noble hearts established his images in
that place, and humans with great festivals installed his images in beautiful
temples. || 294 || The Brahmanas, who were created by the emperor Bharata, the
son of Lord Rishabhadeva, and his son Marichi, due to their pride and arrogance,
spread throughout the world, causing suffering to living beings like poison
drops in water. || 295-296 || Those who have established a tradition of evil
conduct, who are full of pride, who wear various kinds of deceitful garments,
and who hold fierce and sharp weapons, have deluded this world. || 297 || This
entire world is filled with the darkness of extremely cruel actions, which are
constantly in motion. Its light of merit has been extinguished, and it is eager
to disrespect the virtuous. || 298 || The emperor Subhumi destroyed these
Brahmanas twenty-one times on this earth, yet they did not attain complete
annihilation. || 299 || Therefore, O Dasanana, how can you pacify them? Tell me
yourself. Be pacified yourself. There is no purpose in killing living beings. ||
300 || When even the omniscient Jinas could not free this world from evil, then
how can we, ordinary people, do it? || 301 ||

262 In the Padma Purana, it is said that, "Hearing the words of Devyati, Kaikeyi
conceived. Pleased by the story of the Purana, he bowed to the Lord of the
Jinas." ||302|| He remained for a while, happy with Narada, engaged in
delightful stories and the births of great men, full of variety. ||303|| Then
Marutva, with folded hands, his head bowed to the ground, bowed to Ravana and
spoke thus. ||304|| "I am your servant, O Lanka! Be pleased with me, O Lord! Due
to ignorance, evil deeds are indeed committed by beings." ||305|| "Please accept
this girl, whose name is Kanakaprabha. You are indeed the recipient of beautiful
things." ||306|| Ravana, who was compassionate to the humble, accepted her and,
with continuous progress in his happiness, married her. ||307|| Marutva,
pleased, honored Ravana's vassals and warriors with vehicles, clothes,
ornaments, and other things, as was appropriate. ||308|| While enjoying himself
with Kanakaprabha, a daughter was born to Ravana at the end of a year, named
Kritachitra. ||309|| Because she created wonder with her form, a picture, for
those who saw her, she was aptly named Kritachitra. She, like a living
embodiment of beauty, stole the hearts of all. ||310|| The valiant vassals of
Dashaanan, whose enthusiasm was fueled by victory and whose bodies were full of
brilliance, played here and there on the earth. ||311|| Seeing those powerful
vassals of Dashaanan, he who bore the title of 'king' became extremely humble,
filled with fear at the destruction of his pleasures. ||312|| Seeing the middle
part of Bharatavarsha, adorned with golden mountains and rivers, the Vidyadharas
were filled with wonder. ||313|| Some Vidyadharas said, "It would be good if we
stayed here. Surely, even heaven is not more beautiful than this place." ||314||
Others said, "Seeing this country, we will not have any reason to return to
Lanka, to see our families." ||315|| How can people do this? ||301||

263 Some said, "Staying at home doesn't seem appealing at all. Let's see the
captivating expanse of this land." ||316|| Look, how the army of Ravana, vast as
the ocean, is stationed here, so densely packed that they are not even visible
to each other. ||317|| Oh, the extraordinary courage of this people, captivating
the eyes! This realm, along with the realm of the celestial beings, is
considered the best. ||318|| Wherever Ravana, the destroyer of Marutvamkha's
sacrifice, went, the people of that land made his path beautiful with toranas
and other decorations. ||319|| The earth-dwelling women, with faces as beautiful
as the moon, eyes like lotuses, and bodies filled with beauty, were gazing at
Ravana with great respect. Even the celestial beings, driven by curiosity, were
descending to earth to see him. ||320-321|| As Ravana, with his body dark like
the tip of a sharpened arrow or a sword, lips like ripe bimba fruit, forehead
washed with the water of the pearls adorning his crown, hair shining brighter
than the brilliance of an Indranila gem, eyes like lotuses, face like the moon,
adorned with a pair of arched, smooth, and blue eyebrows like a bow with its
string, neck like a conch, shoulders like a lion, broad and thick chest, arms
thick like an elephant's trunk, waist strong and slender like a thunderbolt,
thighs like a serpent's hood, knees submerged in their muscles, feet like
lotuses, body of the right proportion, marked with the thirty-two auspicious
signs like the Srivatsa, his crown gleaming with the rays of gems, his earrings
made of various precious stones, his arms shining with the brilliance of
armlets, his chest adorned with a garland, and holding a half-moon shaped
weapon, was approaching the city, the women were eager to see him. ||322-328||
They abandoned all their previous activities and filled the windows. The women,
filled with love, were crowding each other. ||329||

264 In the Padma Purana, the women, adorned with flowers, showered their love
upon Ravana. They expressed their admiration in various ways.  [330]  Some said,
"Behold, this is the same Ravana who conquered Vaishravana, the son of his
maternal aunt, and Yama. He who was ready to lift Mount Kailasa. He who freed
Sahasrarashmi from the burden of kingship. He is a valiant warrior." [331-332]
"Oh, what a wonderful union of qualities has been brought about by fate in
Ravana after a long time. His beauty and his virtues are a source of joy for the
world." [333]  "That woman is blessed who carried this noble son in her womb.
And that father is fortunate who gave birth to him." [334]  "Those relatives are
praiseworthy who are the objects of his affection. And what can be said of the
women who are married to him?" [335]  The women, engaged in conversation,
continued to gaze at him until he was no longer visible to their wide eyes.
[336]  When Ravana, the thief of hearts, disappeared from their sight, the women
stood motionless for a moment, like paintings. [337]  "Their minds were
captivated by Ravana, and for some time they were lost in their thoughts, unable
to focus on anything else." [338]  Wherever Ravana went, the stories of men and
women in that land were overshadowed by his legend. [339]  The men who held
positions of authority in the country, city, village, or shepherd's settlement,
went to Ravana, bearing gifts. [340]  The people of the villages, carrying
appropriate gifts, went to Ravana, bowed down with folded hands, and expressed
their satisfaction. [341]  They said, "O King! All the beautiful treasures in
the forests of Nandana and others are readily available to you, as if by your
mere wish." [342]  "Since you are worthy of great wealth, what would be the
point of having no son? We offer you these gifts to bring you joy." [343]

## Eleventh Chapter 265  Even though we have empty hands, we have come to see
you. It is not right to come without anything. ||344||  The gods worshipped the
Jina with golden lotuses. How can we, ordinary people, not worship him with
flowers from trees? ||345||  People from various regions and powerful Samantas
worshipped him. He, in turn, honored them with kind words. ||346||  Seeing the
beautiful earth, adorned with various jewels, like his own beloved, he felt
immense joy. ||347||  Wherever he went, due to his path, the land became
abundant with unplanted, self-growing crops. ||348||  The people of that land,
bearing the burden of the earth, showered his pure fame with the water of their
affection. ||349||  The farmers said, "We are blessed, for the son of Ratna
Shrava has come to this land." ||350||  "Until now, we farmers were rough,
wearing tattered clothes, with rough hands and feet, experiencing pain. We spent
our time in misery, never tasting happiness. But now, due to the influence of
this great being, we are prosperous in every way." ||351-352||  The lands where
this benevolent Ravana wanders are blessed with virtue and adorned with wealth.
||353||  "What use are brothers who cannot alleviate suffering? This Ravana is
the elder brother of all beings." ||354||  Thus, increasing the affection of the
people through his virtues, Ravana made the winter and summer seasons pleasant
for them. ||355||  Even inanimate objects, let alone sentient beings, became
beneficial to people, as if they were afraid of Ravana. ||356||  As he continued
his journey, the rainy season arrived, as if it had come to welcome Ravana with
joy. ||357||  Clouds, adorned with lightning bolts, thundered like mountains,
creating a deep, resonant sound. ||358||

In the Padma Purana, it is said that the clouds, adorned with golden halos and
banners, appeared as if Indra had sent them as gifts to Ravana, like elephants
adorned with golden ornaments.  || 358-359 || The clouds, with their dark
masses, shrouded all directions, making it impossible for people to distinguish
between night and day. || 360 || It is fitting for those who are stained with
impurities to make all things in the world appear the same, both light and dark.
|| 361 || The thick, uninterrupted streams of water, clinging to the earth and
sky, were so dense that it was impossible to tell whether they were rising or
falling. || 362 || The store of pride that the women had held in their minds for
a long time was destroyed in an instant by the thunderous roar of the clouds. ||
363 || The women, whose arms were adorned with jingling bangles, were terrified
by the thunder and clung tightly to their husbands. || 364 || The cool, soft
drops of rain, released by the clouds, were like a balm to the spectators, even
though they pierced the hearts of the travelers. || 365 || The heart of the
distant traveler, whose soul was filled with anxiety, was shattered by the
torrent of rain, as if it had been pierced by a sharp wheel. || 366 || The
traveler, captivated by the new flower of the Kadamba tree, became motionless
for a moment, like a clay doll. || 367 || It seemed as if the clouds, which
drank from the ocean of milk, had entered the cows. Otherwise, how could they
continuously pour out streams of milk? || 368 || The farmers, who were wealthy
due to Ravana's influence, were not troubled by the rains at that time. || 369
|| The food prepared by the housewife for one person was consumed by the entire
family, yet it never ran out. || 370 || Thus, Ravana was a festival for all
living beings. Who can describe the good fortune of those who are blessed with
virtue? || 371 || Ravana, dark as a cluster of blue lotuses, with his thunderous
voice, aroused the curiosity of the women. || 372 ||

The Eleventh Chapter 267 As if by the command of Ravana, the waters roared, and
all the kings bowed down in obeisance. ||373|| The maidens, with their
captivating eyes, reached the ten-faced one for the swayamvara. They were like
lightning, having abandoned the sky and descended to the earth. ||374|| They
rejoiced, having attained the one who bore the weight of the earth, like the
clouds, laden with water, delighting in the mountains. ||375|| Seeing the
supreme radiance of the conqueror, the vanquisher of the Yakshas, the sun fled
somewhere, overwhelmed with fear and shame. ||376|| The moon, thinking,
"Whatever I do, the ten-faced one's mouth does the same," went away somewhere.
||377|| Knowing that their lord, the moon, had been conquered by the mouth of
the ten-faced one, the stars, filled with fear, fled somewhere. ||378|| Knowing
that the hands and feet of the women of Kaikesi were more red than theirs, the
lotus-like assembly disappeared somewhere. ||379|| The women, adorned with
lightning-like girdles and weapons of rainbow-colored cloth, and laden with
breasts (or clouds), were like the rainy season for Ravana. ||380|| Ravana, with
his breath, which attracted swarms of buzzing bees, could not distinguish
between the fragrance of the Ketki flowers and the women. ||381|| Having
attained the extremely beautiful and extensive bank of the Ganges, where
abundant, beautiful grass grew far and wide, and where the fragrance of various
flowers filled the air, Ravana spent the rainy season in comfort. ||382||
Gautama Swami says to King Shrenik, "O King! The name of the virtuous man is..."
1. Laden with breasts (or clouds, in the context of the previous verses).  2.
Ravana's.  3. Adorned with lightning-like girdles.  4. Laden with breasts (or
clouds).  5. Disciple.  6. Ravana.

268 Upon hearing the name Padma Purana, virtuous men bow down, they obtain
groups of beautiful women who grant all desires. Abodes of wonder, filled with
supreme wealth, are born to them. Even the sun becomes cool due to their
influence, therefore everyone should strive for virtuous bonds. ||383|| Thus
ends the eleventh chapter, titled "The Destruction of Marutvaya's Sacrifice," in
the Padma Purana, narrated by the sage Ravisha. ||11|| 1.

## The Twelfth Chapter  I  The king, along with his ministers, pondered in
private: "To whom should this daughter be given?" ||1||  There is no certainty
of survival in a battle with Indra. Therefore, it is auspicious to perform the
daughter's marriage ceremony first. ||2||  Knowing that he was troubled by the
search for a suitable groom for his daughter, King Harivahana summoned his son,
Madhu, to his presence. ||3||  Seeing him, handsome and respectful, Ravana was
pleased and decided to give his daughter to him. ||4||  Seated on a suitable
throne, surrounded by his ministers, the wise Ravana, the ten-headed one,
pondered: "The king of Mathura, Harivahana, is born of a noble lineage. His mind
is always engrossed in hearing praise of our virtues. This son, Madhu, is the
lifeblood of him and his relatives. He is praiseworthy, well-mannered, and
worthy of being entrusted with our happiness." ||5-7||  Knowing this, his
actions seem beautiful. His collection of virtues is renowned. It is good that
he has come to me. ||8||  Then, Madhu's minister said, "O King, the virtues of
this valiant man are difficult to describe. However, I will try to describe them
so that you may know them." ||9-10||  This prince, who brings joy to all, truly
embodies the word "Madhu" because he always possesses a sweet, excellent
fragrance. ||11||  His virtues are sufficient to describe him. The Asura king
has bestowed upon him the great, virtuous, spear-jewel. ||12||  This spear-jewel
is never wasted, it is extremely brilliant, and when thrown at the enemy army,
it brings thousands of enemies to their knees before you. ||13||  **Note:** The
text uses several Jain terms, such as "Asura" (demon) and "Indra" (king of the
gods). These terms are not translated as they are specific to Jain cosmology.

## Chapter 270: The Five Puranas  **14.**  "Indeed, you will soon know his
qualities through his actions.  To reveal them through words would only be a
cause for laughter."  **15.** "Therefore, let the Supreme Lord grant you the
wisdom to consider this union.  By obtaining this connection, he will be
fulfilled."  **16.**  Having been convinced by the minister's words, Ravana,
with wisdom, decided to accept him as his son-in-law.  He then arranged all the
necessary preparations for the wedding.  **17.**  The wedding ceremony was
filled with joy and happiness, as all the necessary causes for the union were
effortlessly fulfilled.  **18.**  Just as the spring season, adorned with
countless, captivating flowers, brings joy and fragrance to the world, so too
did Madhu, the prince, find immense happiness upon obtaining the beautiful and
captivating Kritachitra.  **19.**  Driven by curiosity, King Shrenik, with
utmost respect, asked Gautama Swami, "O great sage, why did the Asura king give
the rare Shula Ratna to Madhu?"  **20.**  Upon hearing this, Gautama Swami,
blessed with immense power and devotion to Dharma, explained the reason for the
Shula Ratna's acquisition.  **21.**  He said, "In the city of Shatadvara,
located in the Airavata region of the Dhataki island, there lived two friends
bound by a bond of love."  **22.**  "One was named Sumitra, and the other,
Prabhava.  Both were highly learned, having studied under the same teacher."
**23.**  "Due to the influence of his past virtuous deeds, Sumitra gained a
kingdom served by all his vassals and enjoyed the highest prosperity."  **24.**
"Although Prabhava, due to the effects of his past misdeeds, was born into a
poor family, Sumitra, out of great affection, made him a king as well."  **25.**
"One day, a wicked horse carried Sumitra away to the forest.  There, he was seen
by a savage, wild Mlechchha king named Dvirada-damshthra."  **26.**  "The
Mlechchha king brought Sumitra to his city and, at an opportune moment, forced
him to marry his daughter."  **27.**  "The lost hand returns to the owner."

## The Twelfth Chapter  271  Having obtained that maiden, who was like the very
embodiment of forest prosperity, and who was known as Vanamala, King Sumitra
stayed there for a month.   28  Then, having been granted permission by the
Dvirada-Danstra (the two-tusked one), he set out for the city of Shatadvara,
accompanied by his beloved and surrounded by the Shabara army.  29  Meanwhile,
Prabhava had set out in search of his friend, and he saw him, accompanied by his
beloved, who was like the flag of Kamadeva (the god of love).  30  Prabhava,
whose mind had been rendered devoid of all sense of right and wrong by the rise
of evil deeds, developed a desire for his friend's wife.  31  Tormented on all
sides by the sharp arrows of Kamadeva, his mind was greatly agitated, and he
found no solace anywhere.  32  Kamadeva, the destroyer of the mind, is the
greatest of all diseases, for it does not destroy the body of men, but it causes
them to suffer.  33  Just as the sun is the chief of all luminaries, so is
Kamadeva the chief of all diseases.  34  When his friend asked him, "Why are you
so restless?" he replied, "Seeing the beautiful woman is the cause of my
restlessness."  35  Hearing that his friend, who was dearer to him than life,
was suffering because of his wife, the wise and affectionate Sumitra quickly
sent her to Prabhava's house.  36  Then, hiding himself in a window, he watched
to see what Vanamala would do.  37  He thought to himself, "If this Vanamala
does not favor him, then I will surely punish her."  38  "And if she favors him
and fulfills his desire, then I will worship this beautiful woman with a
thousand villages."  39  When the evening arrived and the sky was adorned with
clusters of stars, Vanamala approached Prabhava with great eagerness.  40
Sumitra seated Vanamala on a beautiful seat and sat opposite her, his heart
pure. Then, with great respect, he asked her, "O noble lady, who are you?"  41
Vanamala then recounted the entire story of her life, from her birth to her
marriage.   42  Having heard this, Prabhava was filled with shame and went to
the Dvirada-Danstra.   The Dvirada-Danstra took him to his village (the
settlement of the Bhils) and, after making a firm agreement, gave his daughter,
Vanamala, in marriage to King Sumitra.

272 "Oh, how wretched I am! I have desired my friend's wife. What a disgrace for
me, this senseless being!" ||43|| "Except by self-destruction, I cannot be freed
from this sin. What use is this life stained with such a blemish?" ||44|| Thus
pondering, he drew his sword from its sheath, its dense shadow obscuring the
space between the directions. ||45|| He brought the sword near his throat, but
his friend, Sumitra, quickly intervened. ||46|| Embracing his friend, he spoke
in a voice filled with concern, "You are wise, do you not know the sin of self-
destruction?" ||47|| "Those who destroy their bodies untimely suffer for a long
time in the womb, unable to be born." ||48|| Saying this, Sumitra took the sword
from his friend's hand and destroyed it, then consoled him with soothing words
for a long time. ||49|| The Acharya says, "The mutual affection of these two
friends, bound by their virtues, will reach its end. This shows that the world
is impermanent." ||50|| Beings, bound by their own karma, attain different
paths, some leading to happiness, others to sorrow. Who is a friend to whom in
this world? ||51|| Later, Sumitra, whose soul was enlightened, embraced the life
of a Shraman and eventually became the lord of the Aishana heaven. ||52|| After
falling from there, he was born in Mathura, on the island of Jambudvipa, as the
son of King Harivahana and Queen Madhavi. He was named Madhu, as he was as
captivating as honey and shone like the moon in the sky of the Harivaṃśa.
||53-54|| The Mithyadṛṣṭi Prabhava, after dying, suffered in a hellish realm and
was reborn as the son of Jyotishmati, named Shikhisruți. ||55|| He became a
Shraman, a Dravyalingī, and through intense penance, became the lord of the
Asuras, known as Chamarendra. ||56|| Then, remembering his past lives through
his knowledge of the future, he recalled the virtues of his friend Sumitra and
kept them pure in his mind. ||57||

## Chapter Twelve  **273** Remembering the excellent character of Sumitra Raja,
his heart became like a broken leaf. **58**  He thought, "Sumitra was a good and
virtuous man. He was my best friend, my helper in all matters." **59**  "We
studied together at the Guru's house. I was born into a poor family, but he made
me equal to him." **60**  "My wife, with a heart free from hatred, was sent to
me by that compassionate one, free from desire, because sin had entered my
mind." **61**  "Knowing that she was the wife of my friend, I was filled with
extreme anxiety and was about to cut off my head with a sword, but he protected
me." **62**  "Without faith in the Jina's teachings, I died and went to hell,
experiencing such suffering that even remembering it is unbearable." **63**
"The consequences of my actions, the condemnation of the virtuous group who
follow the path of liberation, I have received in the form of suffering in many
births." **64**  "And he, Sumitra, having lived a pure life, enjoyed supreme
happiness in the heaven of Aishana. Now he has fallen from there and become
Madhu." **65**  "Attracted by the kindness of his friend, Madhu, whose heart was
filled with love, came out of his palace." **66**  "With great respect, he
worshipped his friend with precious jewels and gave him a spear-jewel called
Sahasrantaka." **67**  "Madhu, the son of Harivahana, received the spear-jewel
and was filled with great joy on earth. He became the master of the art of
weapons." **68**  "Whoever reads or hears this story of Madhu will attain great
brilliance, wealth, and long life." **69**  "Then, followed by many vassals,
Ravana, who destroyed the world, spread his influence, subduing his enemies and
creating many wonders, filled with love." **70**  "He spent eighteen years,
creating wonders in the world, just like Indra in the heavens." **71**

In the Padma Purana, The lord of the earth, leaving the ocean, reached the
eight-peaked Kailasa mountain, adorned with Jina temples, after a long time. ||
72 || There, the Mandakini river, with its clear waters, was adorned with golden
lotus pollen, the queen of the lord of the Sindhu. || 73 || Having stationed his
army nearby, he engaged in delightful pastimes in the caves of Kailasa. || 74 ||
The celestial beings, then the earth-dwellers, in turn, relieved their weariness
in the clear, comfortable, crystal-like waters of the Mandakini. || 75 || The
horses, having their dust removed by the new leaves of the Meru tree, and having
been given water, stood in humility, having been bathed. || 76 || The elephants,
their bodies wet with water spray, having accumulated thick dust, and having had
their great weariness removed by the river, were bathed for a long time by their
keepers. || 77 || Remembering the story of the young girl, Ravana bowed
respectfully to all the Jina temples and performed actions in accordance with
Dharma. || 78 || Then, Indra had appointed Nalakubara as the guardian of the
city called Durlagha, and when he learned from his spies that Ravana, with his
army like a sea, was approaching with the desire to conquer, he, with a fearful
mind, wrote a letter with all the news and sent it to Indra by a swift celestial
being. || 79-81 || When Indra was going to the Meru mountain to worship the Jina
images, the letter-carrier celestial being, bowing, placed Nalakubara's letter
before him. || 82 || Having read the letter and understanding its meaning
completely, Indra, by means of a letter, commanded, "You must remain here with
great effort. You are the holder of the infallible weapon, until I return after
worshipping the Jinas in the Panduka forest." || 83-84 ||

## Chapter Twelve 275  Thus, having given this message, Indra, his mind filled
with devotion to worship, went to the Pandu forest, not taking the enemy army
seriously. ||85||  Meanwhile, Nalakubara, ever-ready to act according to the
situation, along with all his trusted advisors, diligently planned the defense
of the city. ||86||  He had a fortress built, known as Vajrasala, a hundred
yojanas high, with a circumference three times its width, using the power of his
knowledge. ||87||  Knowing that the city was under the control of the enemy,
Ravana sent his commander, Prahasta, to collect tribute. ||88||  Returning to
Ravana, Prahasta said, "O Lord! The enemy city is surrounded by a very high
fortress, making it impossible to capture." ||89||  "Look, you can see the
terrifying fortress from here, extending in all directions. It is very high,
with deep moats, and its mouth resembles that of a fearsome dragon with sharp
fangs." ||90||  "It is filled with a multitude of flames, whose sparks are
difficult to look at, resembling a dense, burning forest of bamboo. ||91||
"There are huge machines, resembling fearsome Vetalas with sharp fangs, attached
to the fortress, which can capture many men within a yojana's distance." ||92||
"Those who fall into the mouths of these machines, their bodies will only
reunite in another birth." ||93||  "Knowing this, you should devise a skillful
strategy to capture the city. Only a farsighted person can truly be a
conqueror." ||94||  "It seems best to flee from this place quickly, as there is
a great and insurmountable danger here." ||95||  Then, the wise ministers of the
ten-headed Ravana, who resided in the caves of Kailasa, began to think of a
solution. ||96||  Meanwhile, Nalakubara's famous wife, Uparambha, whose beauty
and form were like that of the celestial nymph Rambha, heard that Ravana was
nearby. ||97||  She had been attracted to Ravana's qualities from the beginning,
and just as a cluster of moonflowers yearns for the moon, she went to him.

276 In the Padma Purana, the friend named Vichitramala said in private, "Listen,
beautiful one, besides you, who else is a friend like my life?" 19 The word
"friend" is used for one who shares the same opinion, therefore, you are not
worthy of knowing my mind, O beautiful one. 10 Because you are skillful and
worthy of being worshipped, you will surely do what I ask. Therefore, I say that
friends are the greatest support of life. 10 Hearing this, she said, "Why do you
say so, Goddess? I am your servant, use me for whatever you desire." 10 I do not
praise myself, for it is condemned in the world. But I do say this, I am the
embodiment of Siddhi. 103 Speak freely, whatever is in your mind. You are
worrying in vain, for I am true. 104 Then, taking a long, slow breath, she
placed her hand, like a lotus, on her cheek, beautiful as the moon. 105 The
words that came out of her mouth were interrupted by shyness, so she encouraged
them again and again. Her mind was constantly rising and falling in boldness, so
she was struggling to keep it steady. 106 She said, "Friend, since childhood, my
mind has been on Ravana. Although I have heard of his beautiful qualities that
spread throughout the world, I could not meet him. But, on the contrary, due to
my bad luck, I have been united with Nalakuvara, and I constantly suffer from
the pain of unhappiness." 107-108 "O beautiful one, although I know this is not
praiseworthy, O speaker of good words, I am not able to bear death." 109 "He who
stole my heart, Ravana, is now nearby. Please be pleased, friend, and somehow
bring me together with him." 110 Saying, "I bow to your feet," she was about to
bow her head, but her friend stopped her due to her confusion. 111 She was
overcome with longing, just as she was overcome with longing for Ravana. 98

## The Twelfth Canto  **277**  The messenger, knowing all things, said, "O
mistress, I will fulfill your desire in an instant," and departed from the
house.  [112]  She, veiled in a fine garment like a rain-cloud, flew through the
sky and reached the abode of the lord of the Rakshasas in a moment. [113]  She
entered the inner apartments and informed the doorkeeper.  Having made her way
in, she sat down with humility on the seat given by Ravana. [114]  Then she
spoke, "O god, the entire world is filled with your faultless qualities.  It is
fitting that a man like you should be the cause of such an effect." [115]
"Because your generous wealth satisfies the supplicants on earth, I know that
you are devoted to the welfare of all." [116]  "I know that you, who have
assumed this form, will not violate my request.  Indeed, the wealth of people
like you is the cause of **paropkar** (benevolence)." [117]  "O lord, for a
moment, dismiss all your retinue and, with your attention focused, grant me your
favor." [118]  When all the retinue had been dismissed and there was complete
solitude, the messenger, who knew all things, told Ravana the whole story of the
past. [119]  Then, hearing the messenger's words, Ravana covered his ears with
both hands.  He shook his head for a long time and contracted his eyes. [120]
Ravana, who was devoted to good conduct, became troubled for a moment by the
thought of the desire of the woman. [121]  He smiled and said, "O lady, how
could such a thing, which brings about the union of sin, come to your mind?"
[122]  "You have spoken this, abandoning pride.  I am extremely poor in
fulfilling such a request.  What can I do?" [123]  "Whether she is a widow, or
accompanied by her husband, or a respectable woman, or even a courtesan endowed
with beauty, one should strive to avoid all women." [124]  "This act is contrary
both in this world and in the next.  What kind of man is he who is corrupted by
both worlds?" [125]  The friend, who had become eager, quickly caught her head
in the middle. [111]  **Notes:**  1. **Paropkar** is a Jain term meaning
"benevolence" or "doing good to others." 2. **Paramanayant** is a Sanskrit word
meaning "contracting" or "shrinking." 3. **Kulabalika** is a Sanskrit word
meaning "a respectable woman" or "a woman of good family."

In the Padma Purana, Who would desire to eat food that is full of the saliva of
another man's mouth and has been touched by another man's body? || 126 ||
Vibhishana, who was dear to Ravana, heard this with pleasure. Vibhishana, who
was a knower of policy and always a leader among the councilors, said this: ||
127 || O God! Since this is the way things are, a king who knows policy must
always tell a lie, even if it is a small one. || 128 || Perhaps, by accepting,
she will be pleased and, having gained confidence, will tell some way to take
the city. || 129 || Then, following Vibhishana's words, Ravana, who was a
follower of deceit, said to the messenger: O Bhadra! What you have said is
right. || 130 || That poor woman's life is stuck in me, and she is in great
distress. She is worthy of being protected by me. Indeed, generous people are
compassionate. || 131 || Therefore, go and bring her back, even if it costs you
your life. It is heard in the world that it is Dharma to protect living beings.
|| 132 || Having said this, Ravana sent the messenger, who went and brought back
Uparambha in a moment. Ravana honored her greatly upon her arrival. || 133 ||
Then, when Uparambha, who was under the sway of Kama, reached Ravana, Ravana
said: O Devi! My intense desire is to enjoy myself in the city of Durlagha. ||
134 || Tell me, what pleasure is there in this forest? And what is the cause of
Kama? O Devi! Do something so that I can enjoy myself with you in the city. ||
135 || Women are naturally easily deceived, so Uparambha did not understand
Ravana's cunning. In short, she, being afflicted by Kama, gave him the knowledge
called Ashalika, which stood as a rampart, and various weapons, which were
protected by Vyantara Devas, with great respect. || 136-137 || As soon as she
received the knowledge, that illusory rampart disappeared, and in its absence,
the city remained surrounded only by its natural rampart. || 138 || Ravana, with
a large army, reached near the city. Hearing the noise of the city, Nalakuvara
became agitated. || 139 ||

## The Twelfth Canto  271  Seeing this, the Lokapala, Nalakuvara, was filled
with despair. He thought that the city had been taken by the Yaksha, Ravana.
||14||  Despite this, he, bearing the spirit of a warrior, went out to fight,
even though it meant certain death. He was accompanied by all his loyal vassals.
||140-141||  Then, in the midst of a great battle, filled with weapons and
thunderous sounds, where even the rays of the sun could not penetrate,
Vibhishana, with great speed, attacked Nalakuvara's chariot, breaking its axle
with a kick, and captured him alive. ||142-143||  Vibhishana, filled with rage,
did to Nalakuvara what Ravana had done to King Sahasrakirana. ||144||  At that
time, Ravana obtained the Sudarshana Chakra, a jewel-studded disc, which was
capable of striking fear into the hearts of both gods and demons, and was
associated with Indra. ||145||  Then, Ravana, in private, said to Uparambha, "O
Pravarangane, by teaching me, you have become my guru." ||146||  "It is not
proper for you to do this while your husband is alive. And I, who am a teacher
of the path of righteousness, am even less worthy of such an act." ||147||
After this, Ravana, having comforted Nalakuvara, took him to his wife.
Nalakuvara, whose armor was torn and whose body was wounded, was brought before
her. ||148||  Ravana said, "Enjoy all the pleasures you desire with this
husband. What difference is there between me and him in the matter of
enjoyment?" ||149||  "My reputation will be tarnished by this act, and others
will follow my example." ||150||  "You are the daughter of King Akashadhvaja and
Mridunakanta, born into a pure lineage. It is your duty to protect your virtue."
||151||  Hearing this, Uparambha was filled with shame and realized her mistake.
She became content with her husband. ||152||  Nalakuvara, unaware of his wife's
infidelity, continued to enjoy her company, having received honor from Ravana.

## English Translation:  **280**  In the battle, Ravana, having achieved supreme
glory by destroying his enemies, reached the land of Vijayadgiri with increasing
prosperity. ||154||  Hearing of Ravana's approach, Indra, moving from the
assembly of the gods, addressed all of them. ||155||  "O Vasvasvi and other
gods! Why are you sitting relaxed? The lord of the Rakshasas, Ravana, has
arrived here." ||156||  Saying this, Indra went to his father to seek counsel.
He sat down on the earth, bowing respectfully. ||157||  He said, "What should I
do in this situation? This enemy, whom I have defeated many times, has returned,
now powerful." ||158||  "O father! I have committed a great injustice against my
own duty by not destroying this enemy when he was weak." ||159||  "Even a common
man can break a thorn when it is just emerging, but when it grows strong, it
requires great effort." ||160||  "When a disease arises, it is easily destroyed,
but when it takes root and spreads, it can only be countered after death."
||161||  "I have tried many times to destroy him, but you stopped me. You have
made me forgive him in vain." ||162||  "O father! I am speaking this following
the path of righteousness. It is the duty of a family to consult elders, and
that is why I asked you. I am not incapable of killing him." ||163||  Hearing
his son's words, filled with pride and anger, Sahasrar said, "O son! Do not be
hasty." ||164||  "First, consult with wise ministers, for the work of those who
act without deliberation becomes futile." ||165||  "Mere effort is not the cause
of success, for what can a farmer achieve without rain? Similarly, what can a
hardworking person achieve without the right circumstances?" ||166||  "Those who
have equal effort and equal respect, some achieve success, while others fail due
to the nature of their karma." ||167||

167. Some of the students who are reading will succeed and some will not succeed
due to the compulsion of their karma. 168. Even if such a situation arises, you
should make peace with Ravana, because if peace is made, you can make the whole
world free from thorns. 169. Also, you should give your beautiful daughter,
Rupini, to Ravana. There is no fault in doing so. Rather, your status will
remain the same by doing so. 170. The father, who was the holder of pure
intellect, explained this to Indra, but due to the group of anger, his eyes
turned red in an instant. 171. Indra, whose body was filled with sweat due to
the heat of the fire of anger, spoke as if he was breaking the sky with his
voice, saying, "Father! How is it appropriate to give a daughter to someone who
is worthy of being killed? Or, the intellect of old men is simply diminished."
172. "Father! Tell me, what am I inferior to him in? Because of which you have
spoken these very humble words." 173. "He who is extremely distressed even when
the rays of the sun touch his head, how will he bow down to another man who is a
noble human being?" 174. "I am superior to Ravana in every way in terms of
manhood, then how did it come to your mind that fate is in his favor?" 175. "If
you think that he has conquered many enemies, then does a hunter not kill a lion
who kills many deer?" 176. "In a battle where groups of flames are being
generated by the clash of weapons, it is better to give up one's life than to
bow down to an enemy." 177. "That Indra bowed down to the demon Ravana. I have
never seen such a thing in the world, why haven't you seen it?" 178. "Being a
celestial being is common, and it is not the reason for peace. Just as there is
no unity between a lion and a jackal because of their commonality in living in
the forest, similarly, there can be no unity between us two because of the
commonality of being celestial beings." 179. As he was saying this, the loud
sound of the enemy army, which filled the whole world, entered his ears. 180.

trumpet to signal the preparation for battle.  2. "Bring the elephant quickly,
saddle the horses quickly, bring the sword here, bring a good shield, run and
bring the bow, bring the helmet to protect the head, bring the arm band quickly,
bring the dagger quickly, hey, groom, yoke the horses and prepare the chariot."
Thus, the Vidyaadharas, known as Devas, began to move around. 3. Then, when the
valiant warriors were agitated, the drums were beating, the conch shells were
roaring loudly, the elephants were roaring repeatedly, the horses were letting
out long roars as soon as they were touched by the whip, the groups of chariots
were moving, and the groups of bowstrings were humming loudly, the world was
filled with the laughter of the warriors and the victory cries of the
charioteers, as if it were created by sound. 4. The entire direction was covered
with swords, tomars, nooses, flags, umbrellas, and bows, and the sun's influence
was lost. 5. The Devas, who were eager for speed, came out, ready and prepared,
and they pushed and shoved near the gate, listening to the sound of the bells on
the elephants. 6. "Park the chariot over there, this intoxicated elephant is
coming here. Hey, mahout! Quickly remove the elephant from here. Hey, rider! Why
are you stopping here? Quickly take the horse forward. Hey, fool! Leave me and
go back, don't make me anxious for nothing."  Thus, the Devas, filled with
haste, came out of their houses. At that time, they were roaring with pride. 7.
When the army, whose enthusiasm was increasing due to the trumpet that was
sometimes played softly and sometimes loudly, stood in its place after facing
the enemy, the Devas, releasing a group of weapons that covered the sky, broke
the face of the Rakshasa army, that is, they attacked the front part of it with
force.

## The Twelfth Canto  **283**  Vajravega, Prahasta, Hasta, Maricha, Udbhava,
Vajramukha, Shuka, Ghora, Saran, Gaganojjvala, Mahajatara, Sandhyabhra, and
Krura, these fierce Rakshasas stood before their army. All of them were clad in
armor, mounted on excellent steeds, and armed with fine weapons.  **196-197**
Then, these valiant Rakshasas, in a moment, destroyed the army of the gods,
striking fear into their hearts. The weapons they abandoned fell into the hands
of their enemies.  **198**  Seeing the destruction of their army, the great gods
rose to fight. Their bodies were filled with intense anger.  **199**  Meghamali,
Tadipinga, Jvalitaksha, Arisajvara, and Agniratha, these gods appeared,
showering down a torrent of weapons, their bodies ablaze with the fire of their
anger.  **200**  Rising up, they confronted the Rakshasas, who were raining down
a storm of weapons.  **201**  After a long battle, the Rakshasas were defeated.
Each Rakshasa was surrounded by many gods.  **202**  Like insects caught in a
whirlwind, the Rakshasas were tossed about, their weapons falling from their
weakened hands.  **203**  Many Rakshasas turned back from the battle, but those
who were proud, faced their death, refusing to surrender their weapons.  **204**
Seeing the Rakshasa army crumbling under the onslaught of the gods, the mighty
son of King Mahendra, the valiant Kapiketo, who was known for his wisdom and
bore the auspicious name Prasannakirti, advanced towards the enemy army,
striking fear into their hearts.  **205-206**  Protecting his own army, he
turned the enemy army back with a continuous barrage of arrows.  **207**  The
army of the gods who resided on Mount Vijayadhara, shining with their various
weapons, was initially filled with great enthusiasm at the sight of
Prasannakirti.  **208**  But when they saw the mark of the monkey on his banner
and umbrella, their hearts sank.  **209**  Then, with his blazing arrows, he
pierced the hearts of the enemy, like the arrows of Kamadeva pierce the hearts
of those who are infatuated.  **210**  **Notes:**  * **Rakshasa:** A type of
demon in Hindu mythology. * **Deva:** A god in Hindu mythology. *
**Prasannakirti:** A name meaning "one whose fame is pleasing." * **Kapiketo:**
A name meaning "one who has a monkey flag." * **Vijayadhara:** A mountain in
Hindu mythology, said to be the abode of the gods. * **Kamadeva:** The Hindu god
of love.

In the Padma Purana,   **Verse 211:** Another army, fit for the gods, arrived,
filled with gold, maces, weapons, bows, and maces.  **Verse 212:** Then, from
within their ranks, stood the extremely valiant son of Malyavan, known as Sri
Mali, with a resolute heart.  **Verse 213:** In a moment, he sent the gods,
shining like the sun, to an unknown place, as he released a volley of arrows.
**Verse 214:** Seeing him, the enemy, unstoppable in his might, stirred up the
army of his foes like a great wave,  **Verse 215:**  a mass of maddened elephant
kings, clashing with the enemy ranks, wielding swords, and moving amidst the
chaos.  **Verse 216:** The gods, roused to defend their own strength, their
bodies consumed by great anger, their weapons gleaming,  **Verse 217:**  Shikhi,
Kesari, Danda, Ugra, Kanaka, Pravara, and other warriors of Indra, covered the
sky far and wide, like rain clouds.  **Verse 218:**  And Indra's own sons, like
Mriga-chinha and others, blazing with the brilliance of battle, immensely
powerful, covered the sky far and wide.  **Verse 219:** Then, Sri Mali, with his
crescent-shaped arrows, covered the earth with their severed heads, as if with
lotuses and their stalks.  **Verse 220:**  Indra pondered, "Who among these
gods, or these valiant princes, can stand before this Rakshasa, whose brilliance
is immense, whose power is overwhelming?  **Verse 221:**  Therefore, I myself
will destroy his faith in battle, before he destroys the other gods."  **Verse
222:**  Thinking thus, he reassured his army, trembling with fear, as the lord
of the gods prepared to fight.  **Verse 223:**  Just as the heart of a wicked
teacher is shattered by the arrows of Kama, so too was the army of the gods
shattered by the arrows of Prasanna Kirti, whose blazing flames were like fire.
**Verse 210:**  After that, the army of the gods and another army came face to
face. That army was equipped with gold, swords, maces, weapons, bows, and maces.
**Verse 211:**  After that, the son of Malyavan, Sri Mali, who was extremely
valiant and had a fearless heart, stood in front of the army of the gods.
**Verse 212:**  Where Sri Mali, whose radiance was like that of the sun, and who
was constantly releasing a volley of arrows, sent the gods in a moment, no one
knew.  **Verse 213:**  Then, seeing Sri Mali, who stood before them, unstoppable
in his might, who was stirring up the army of his foes like a great wave, who
was charging his maddened elephant kings against the enemy ranks, and who was
wielding a sword and moving amidst the chaos of the warriors, the gods rose to
defend their own army. At that time, their bodies were consumed by great anger,
and their weapons were gleaming.  **Verse 214-216:**  Shikhi, Kesari, Danda,
Ugra, Kanaka, Pravara, and other warriors of Indra covered the sky far and wide,
like rain clouds.  **Verse 217:**  Besides these, Indra's sons, like Mriga-
chinha and others, who were blazing with the brilliance of battle, immensely
powerful, were covering the sky far and wide.  **Verse 218:**  Then, Sri Mali,
with his crescent-shaped arrows, covered the earth with their severed heads, as
if with lotuses and their stalks.  **Verse 219:**  Then Indra thought, "Who
among these gods, or these valiant princes, can stand before this Rakshasa,
whose brilliance is immense, whose power is overwhelming? Therefore, I myself
will destroy his faith in battle, before he destroys the other gods."  **Verse
220-222:**  Thinking thus, he reassured his army, trembling with fear, as the
lord of the gods prepared to fight.

## The Twelfth Chapter  2  Falling to his feet, and touching the ground with his
knees, Jayant, renowned as a great hero, spoke to him: "O Indra, if you engage
in battle while I am alive, then my birth from you will be meaningless."  "When
I was a child, you would play with me in your lap, and you would look at me with
love. Now I want to repay that love, to be free from that debt."  "Therefore,
father, stay at home without worry. I will destroy all your enemies in an
instant."  "Father, what can be cut with a nail with little effort, is pointless
to cut with an axe."  Thus, having persuaded his father, Jayant prepared for
battle. At that time, he seemed to be swallowing the sky itself with his body,
filled with rage.  Protected by his army, shining with weapons, and swift as the
wind, Jayant approached Srimal without any hesitation.  Srimal, seeing his
worthy adversary after a long time, was very pleased. He ran towards him, moving
through the midst of his army.  Then, the two princes, whose bowstrings were
constantly drawn, showered each other with arrows, filled with anger.  The two
armies, standing in their respective lines, watched the battle of the two
princes, their minds filled with wonder.  Then, Srimal, cheering his army, broke
Jayant's chariot with his weapon, Kanak, making him charioteerless.  Jayant fell
unconscious, and seeing him fall, the hearts of his army sank. When he regained
consciousness and rose, the hearts of his army also rose.  Then, Jayant,
wielding the weapon Bhindimala, made Srimal charioteerless. He struck him with
such force, fueled by anger, that Srimal fell unconscious.  Then, a great roar
of joy arose from the enemy army, and a similar sound of lamentation arose from
Jayant's army.

286 In the Padma Purana, Sri Mali, enraged after regaining consciousness,
charged towards Jayanta, showering him with a storm of weapons. He appeared
terrifying. ||23|| The two princes, shedding their weapons, shone brightly, like
two lion cubs with their mane ablaze. ||239|| Then, the son of the king of the
gods, Jayanta, struck the son of Malyavan, Sri Mali, with his mace, killing him
instantly. He fell to the ground. ||240|| Blood gushing from his mouth, Sri Mali
fell to the earth, resembling a setting sun. ||241|| After killing Sri Mali,
Jayanta, mounted on his chariot, blew his conch shell in joy. The demons,
terrified, fled in all directions. ||242|| Seeing Sri Mali lifeless and Jayanta,
whose warriors were shouting in victory, ready for battle, Indrajit, the son of
Ravana, came forward to face him. He reassured his fleeing army, his anger
burning fiercely. ||243-244|| Then, like Kali in his wrath, Indrajit, with his
arrows, shattered Jayanta's armor, just as he had shattered his armor, he
shattered his body. ||245|| Seeing Jayanta, whose armor was broken, whose body
was red with blood, and who was covered with arrows like a hedgehog, Indra
himself rose to fight. He covered the sky with his vehicles and his shining,
sharp weapons. ||246-247|| Seeing Indra ready for battle, his charioteer,
Sanmati, said to Ravana, "O God! This is Indra, the lord of the gods, himself."
||248|| The Lokapalas, the guardians of the world, are protecting him from all
sides. He is mounted on his intoxicated elephant, Airavata, adorned with the
brilliance of his crown jewels. He is covered by a white umbrella, shielding the
sun, and surrounded by an army like a raging ocean. ||249-250|| 1. Vivodbhut m.

## The Twelfth Canto  **287** This Kumar, Indrajit, is too powerful for this
battle. You yourself should rise and destroy the enemy's pride. **251**  Seeing
Indrajit approaching, strong and unyielding, Ravana, remembering the death of
Mali and burning with the recent slaying of Sri Mali, charged forward in his
chariot, swift as the wind. **252**  Seeing his son surrounded by enemies,
Ravana, filled with rage, rushed forward in his chariot, swift as the wind.
**253**  The battle between these two warriors was thrilling and terrifying. It
was shrouded in the dense darkness created by the clash of weapons. **254**  In
the darkness created by the weapons and the crimson mist, the valiant warriors
could only be identified by their loud roars. **255**  Those warriors who had
previously been hesitant to fight, now, spurred by their devotion to their lord
and fueled by the anger of being struck, fought fiercely. **256**  They fought
with maces, javelins, spears, clubs, swords, arrows, axes, golden discs,
daggers, swords, tridents, nooses, maces, axes, maces, bows, stones,
ploughshares, staffs, arrows, and countless other weapons designed to cut and
kill. The sky was terrifying, filled with the fire of the clashing weapons.
**257-259**  Here the sound of "grasad-grasad", there the sound of "shud-shud",
here the roar of "ran-ran", there the sound of "kin-kin", here the sound of
"trap-trap", there the sound of "dam-dam", here the sound of "chham-chham",
there the sound of "pat-pat", here the sound of "chal-chal", there the sound of
"tadd-tadd", here the sound of "tad-tad", there the sound of "chat-chat", and
here the sound of "ghghghghgh". The battlefield was filled with the sounds of
the clashing weapons. **260-263**  Horses were killing horses, elephants were
killing elephants, charioteers were killing charioteers, elephant riders were
killing elephant riders, and chariots were destroying chariots. **264**  The
infantry, eager to fight, were ready to attack anyone who came before them.

288 The group of water droplets, like a cluster of pearls, emanating from the
elephant's trunk, extinguished the smoke and fire caused by the clash of
weapons. ||266|| The massive teeth, like statues, falling from the elephant's
mouth, shattered the ranks of the enemy soldiers. ||267||  "Strike, brave
warrior, why are you being cowardly?  O valiant soldier, endure the blow of my
sword for a moment." ||268|| "You are already dead, where can you go now after
coming to me? You are poorly trained, you don't even know how to hold a bow."
||269|| "Run away and protect yourself, your battle-scar is useless. You have
inflicted such a small wound that it hasn't even scratched my skin." ||270||
"You have wasted your master's wages, why are you roaring?  Your bravery will be
revealed when the time comes." ||271|| "Why are you trembling?  Gain some
stability, quickly take the arrow, hold your fist firm, see this sword will slip
and fall." ||272|| Such conversations were repeatedly exchanged between the
valiant warriors, filled with utmost enthusiasm, in front of their masters
during the battle. ||273||  One warrior's arm was heavy with laziness, it
wouldn't move, but when the enemy struck it with a mace, it started dancing in
an instant and became strong. ||274||  Someone's head, profusely bleeding, fell
down, repeatedly thanking the enemy. ||275|| The warriors' chests were pierced
by arrows, but their minds were not broken. Their heads fell, but their pride
remained. They preferred death over life. ||276|| The skilled and powerful
warriors, protecting their honor, fought bravely and gave up their lives in the
face of danger. ||277|| One warrior, filled with anger, was about to die, but he
attacked the enemy's body as he fell. ||278||  One valiant warrior, struck by
the enemy's weapon, retaliated with a fist and a mace, making the enemy fall to
the ground. ||279||  He was ready to fight the infantry. ||265||

## The Twelfth Chapter  **289.** A great warrior embraced his enemy like a
friend, squeezing him tightly until he was lifeless. The enemy's blood flowed
freely from the embrace.  **290.** Another warrior, slaying the enemy ranks,
cleared a path for himself in the battle. Fear kept other men from crossing his
path.  **291.** Even as they fell, the best warriors never showed their backs to
the enemy, whose chests swelled with pride.  **292.** Horses, chariots,
warriors, and elephants fell with great force, crushing thousands of horses,
chariots, warriors, and elephants.  **293.** The sky was filled with a mixture
of dust raised by falling weapons, blood, and the intoxicating scent of
elephants.  **294.** One fierce warrior, holding his spilling intestines with
his left hand, raised his sword in his right and charged towards the enemy.
**295.** Another warrior, his lips clenched and his eyes wide open, tightened
his belt with his own intestines and advanced towards the enemy.  **296.** A
warrior, consumed by rage, picked up a large stone with both hands and hurled it
at the enemy's head, who had lost his weapons.  **297.** Another warrior, his
clothes stained with the blood of his fallen enemy, picked up his own severed
bone and charged towards the enemy.  **298.** A warrior, eager for battle and
full of the tricks of war, captured his enemy with a noose, dragged him far
away, and released him.  **299.** Seeing his enemy disarmed and defeated, a
warrior, eager for a fair fight, reluctantly abandoned his own weapon and
approached the enemy.  **300.** One warrior, using a bow with a flaming
arrowhead, rained down a torrent of blood upon the enemy, killing many.
**301.** Another warrior, though his head was severed, still charged at the
enemy with great speed, wielding a stone in his hand.

**Padma Purana**  "Even though the head of someone filled with pride was cut
off, he continued to bite his lips and roar, falling down only after a long
time. || 293 || Another warrior, who seemed like a snake, cast a terrifying
glance like a meteor upon his opponent as he fell. || 294 || One valiant warrior
held his half-severed head with his left hand and with his right hand, he cut
off the head of his opponent and threw it down. || 295 || Another warrior, whose
weapon could not reach his enemy, threw it in anger and was ready to kill him
with his long arms like a club. || 296 || One compassionate warrior saw his
enemy lying unconscious. When he could not find water or other means to revive
him, he, filled with anxiety, began to sprinkle his own blood, cooled by the air
from the edge of his garment, upon him. || 297 || When the brave warriors
fainted, they thought they had found rest; when they were wounded by weapons,
they thought they had found pleasure; and when they died, they thought they had
achieved their purpose. || 298 || Thus, a great battle was raging, a battle that
terrified even fear itself and was eager to bring joy to the best of men. || 299
|| Where elephants were pulling valiant men towards them with their trunks, but
those valiant men were cutting off their trunks. Where men were eager to cut the
horses, but those swift horses were throwing them down with the blows of their
hooves. || 300 || Where horses, urged on by their charioteers, were pulling
chariots, but their bodies were being wounded. Where headless elephants lay
fallen and men were walking over them. || 301 || Where the bodies of foot
soldiers were being shattered by the forceful blows of each other. Where valiant
warriors were pulling the tails of horses with their hands so hard that they
stood still. || 302 || Where the temples of elephants were being split by the
blows of hands and pearls were falling out of them. Where chariots were being
broken by falling elephants and many warriors were being injured. || 303 ||

The twelfth battle Where the ground was covered with a layer of blood, and the
sky and directions were covered with blood, and where the roar of the elephants
created a fierce wind. || 304 || The battle was fierce, but the valiant Ravana,
filled with the curiosity of war, was not paying attention to it. He said to his
charioteer, Sumati, the son of Kaikasi, that the chariot should be taken in
front of Indra, for what is the use of killing his other vassals who are not our
equals? || 305 - 306 || My weapon does not rise against these insignificant
vassals, nor does my mind, which is eager to devour the great enemy, turn
towards them. || 307 || This Vidyaadhara, who has made himself a laughingstock,
has made himself invincible out of petty pride. I will remove his Indrahood
today with death. || 308 || This Indra has made himself great, he has made these
Lokapalas. He considers other humans as gods and the Vijayardha mountain as
heaven. || 309 || It is a matter of great wonder that just as a foolish clown,
wearing the guise of a noble man, forgets himself, so this foolish man,
intoxicated by his petty wealth, is forgetting himself and becoming a
laughingstock for the people. || 310 || He has lived for a long time in the womb
of his mother, filled with semen, blood, flesh, bones and marrow, and has come
to consider himself a god. || 311 || This impatient person, who is doing
something with the power of knowledge, considers himself a god, just as a bird
considers itself a Garuda. || 312 || Having said this, Sumati, the charioteer,
entered Ravana's chariot, protected by the mighty vassals, into Indra's army. ||
313 || There, Ravana saw with a clear eye Indra's vassals, who were fleeing,
unable to fight, and whose pathetic movements were like those of insects. || 314
|| Just as the flow of water cannot be stopped by the banks, and just as a man
who observes vows with a false vision cannot stop the momentum of his mind with
anger, so the enemies could not stop Ravana from advancing. || 315 || Just as
darkness is destroyed by the rising of the moon, so the army of the gods was
destroyed. || 316 ||

## Padma Purana  Indra, mounted on an elephant, approached Ravana, who was as
tall as Mount Kailasa, and drew an arrow from his quiver. ||317|| Like a cloud
pouring down a torrent of water on a mountain, Indra rained down arrows on
Ravana. ||318|| Ravana, in turn, pierced Indra's arrows with his own, creating a
canopy of arrows in the sky. ||319|| Arrows pierced arrows, and the rays of the
sun were extinguished, as if they had vanished in fear. ||320|| Narada, filled
with joy at the sight of the battle, danced in a place where arrows could not
reach. ||321||   Realizing that Ravana was invincible to ordinary weapons, Indra
launched an Agni Astra (fire weapon). ||322|| The Agni Astra was so vast that
the sky itself became its fuel. What can be said of bows and other material
objects? ||323|| The roar of the Agni Astra was like the sound of a bamboo
forest burning, its flames blazing fiercely. ||324||   Seeing his army engulfed
in flames, Ravana quickly launched a Varuna Astra (water weapon). ||325|| The
Varuna Astra instantly summoned a vast cloud, which poured down torrential rain
like a mountain, thunderous and majestic. It seemed as if the sky itself had
melted from Ravana's anger. The cloud extinguished Indra's Agni Astra in an
instant. ||326-327||   Indra then unleashed a Tamas Astra (darkness weapon),
which enveloped the sky and all directions in utter darkness. ||328|| The Tamas
Astra engulfed Ravana's army, rendering them unable to see even their own
bodies, let alone the enemy forces. ||329||   Seeing his army in disarray,
Ravana's son, Ratna Shrava, a master of strategy and tactics, launched a Prabha
Astra (light weapon). ||330||

## The Twelfth Chapter  **330.** Ravana, skilled in warfare, seeing his army
bewildered, released the Prabhastra, the arrow of light.   **331.** Just as the
truth of the Jina teachings destroys the beliefs of the misguided, so too did
that Prabhastra instantly dispel all darkness.  **332.** Then, in a fit of rage,
Ravana unleashed the Naga Astra, filling the sky with radiant serpents.
**333.** Those arrows, capable of assuming any form at will, went to Indra and
rendered him motionless, clinging to his body.  **334.** Indra was overwhelmed
by fear, surrounded by those serpents, dark as the finest indigo, shaped like
rings, and with flickering tongues.  **335.** Just as a creature trapped in the
ocean of existence is bound by the web of karma, so too was Indra, encircled by
the serpents, rendered helpless.  **336.** Indra then focused his mind on the
Garuda Astra, and instantly the sky turned yellow with the brilliance of golden
wings.  **337.** The wind from Garuda's wings, with its immense speed, caused
Ravana's entire army to sway like a swing, unable to maintain their balance.
**338.** The Naga arrows, struck by the wind of Garuda, vanished without a
trace. Their points of attachment to Indra's body were no longer discernible.
**339.** Embraced by Garuda, freed from all bonds, Indra became as terrifying as
the sun in the summer.  **340.** Seeing Indra freed from the serpent coils,
Ravana mounted his victorious elephant, the Triloka Mandana, whose tusks dripped
with intoxicating nectar.  **341.** In a fit of rage, Indra brought his own
elephant, Airavata, close to Ravana. A great battle ensued between the two proud
elephants.  **342.** Both elephants, dripping with intoxicating nectar, adorned
with lightning-like golden garlands, and roaring continuously, assumed the form
of clouds.  **343.** The clash of their tusks was like the thunder of falling
thunderbolts, shaking the entire world with their resounding roar.  **344.**
With their powerful trunks, they struck each other repeatedly, their movements
swift and fierce.

## English Translation:  294 Padma Purana  The two elephants, whose bodies were
extremely agile and whose speed was immense, were brandishing their thick
trunks, expanding, contracting, and striking. ||344|| With their eyes, whose
pupils were clearly visible and whose gaze was extremely cruel, their ears
erect, and possessing immense strength, the two elephants engaged in a very
fierce battle. ||345||  Then, the powerful Ravana leaped up and placed his foot
on Indra's head. With great speed, he kicked the charioteer down. Repeatedly
assuring Indra, Ravana bound him tightly with a cloth and mounted him on his
elephant. ||346-347||  Meanwhile, Indrajit also bound Jayanta and handed him
over to the servants. Then, Indrajit, whose enthusiasm was fueled by victory and
who was burning with the desire to defeat his enemies, ran towards the army of
the gods. Seeing him run, Ravana, who was causing suffering to his enemies,
said, "O son! Now your efforts are in vain. Retreat from the battle out of
respect for the fight. The head of this army of the mountain dwellers is now in
my hands." ||348-350||  "With him in my grasp, who else can stir? Let these
petty vassals live and go to their desired places." ||351||  "When rice is
extracted from a heap of paddy, the husk is discarded without any reason."
||352||  Thus, Indrajit, discouraged by Ravana's words, retreated from the
battle. At that time, a large group of kings surrounded Indrajit. ||353||  Then,
just as a large, long cloud of the autumn season dissipates in an instant, so
too did Indra's army disperse in a flash, scattering in all directions. ||354||
A great victory cry was raised in Ravana's army by the excellent drums, conch
shells, cymbals, and groups of prisoners. ||355||  Hearing that cry, Ravana's
army became agitated and disheartened, knowing that Indra had been captured.
||356||  Then, Ravana, endowed with supreme power, departed for Lanka, his
chariot covering the sky. He was very pleased at that time. ||357||  His
chariots, resembling the sun's chariot, were adorned with flags and emitted
rainbows from the rays of various jewels. ||358||  1. Sammukham M. | 2.

## The Twelfth Chapter  Horses adorned with beautiful, fluttering fly whisks,
moving with carefree grace, as if dancing, enhanced his splendor.  ||359||  A
multitude of elephants, their necks adorned with large, resonant bells, from
which flowed streams of intoxicating nectar, their trumpets resonating with a
sweet sound, followed by a swarm of bees, accompanied him. ||360||  Along with
these, the lords of great armies, mounted on their respective steeds, the
celestial beings, the Vidyadharas, followed him.  Thus, in a moment, Ravana
reached the outskirts of Lanka. ||361||  Seeing Ravana approaching, the
protectors of the city, the citizens, and their relatives, filled with
anticipation, came out to receive him, bearing offerings. ||362||  Some
performed rituals for Ravana, while he, in turn, performed rituals for some
elders.  Some bowed to him, while he, free from pride, bowed to some elders.
||363||  Knowing the nature of people, and with affection for the humble, Ravana
honored some with a loving gaze.  He greeted some with a gentle smile, and
others with pleasant words. ||364||  The city of Lanka, naturally beautiful, and
adorned with special embellishments on this occasion, was adorned with tall,
magnificent, gem-studded arches. ||365||  The city was filled with colorful
flags, fluttering in the gentle breeze, and the entire earth was sprinkled with
saffron and other fragrant substances. ||366||  The royal roads were adorned
with flowers of all seasons, and the city was decorated with numerous garlands
made of five-colored powders, black, yellow, blue, red, and green. ||367||  The
city gates were adorned with full, shining pots, and the city was decorated with
garlands of fresh leaves and fine garments, and a grand celebration was
underway.  It was in this city of Lanka that Ravana entered. ||368||  Just as
Indra is surrounded by many gods, so too was Ravana surrounded by many
Vidyadharas.  At that time, he was enjoying the supreme happiness, the result of
his past virtuous deeds. ||369||  Mounted on a beautiful, wish-fulfilling
chariot, with a radiant crown, a magnificent necklace, and strong arms, he...

In the **Papouraana**, He was adorned with a garland of jewels, radiating pure
brilliance, like the spring season adorned with a multitude of blooming flowers.
||371|| He was gazed upon by women filled with insatiable joy, their
**chamaras** gently raised, their expressions full of excitement. ||372|| He was
delighted by the sounds of various instruments and the melodious cries of
victory, accompanied by the finest dancing courtesans. ||373|| Thus, he entered
Lanka, filled with joy and numerous festivities, and was welcomed by his family
and servants, entering his own abode. ||374||  **Gautama Swami** tells King
**Shrenik** that Indra, the **Vidhyadhara**, who had achieved great prosperity
through the power of his past good deeds, having conquered all his enemies,
well-prepared and as insignificant as blades of grass, lost his radiance and
wealth when his **punya karma** diminished. Alas for the fleeting happiness of
mortals! ||375||  And **Ravana**, the **Vidhyadhara**, through the power of his
past good deeds, destroyed all his powerful enemies and achieved great
prosperity. Knowing that all actions in the world are born of **karma**, O noble
ones! Abandon attachment to other things and accumulate the **punya karma** that
shines like the sun. ||376||  Thus ends the twelfth chapter of the
**Padmacharita**, narrated by the **Acharya** **Ravishena**, known as
**Aarsha**, describing the defeat of Indra, the **Vidhyadhara**. ||12||

## The Thirteenth Chapter  Then, the Samantas of Indra, filled with sorrow for
their lord, arrived at Ravana's palace, led by Sahasrar. ||1|| They entered,
respectfully informed the gatekeepers, and stood bowing, seated as befitting
their status. ||2|| Ravana, with great dignity, looked upon Sahasrar. Sahasrar
said to Ravana, "You have conquered my son Indra. Now, release him at my
request." ||3|| "You have shown the greatness of your arms and your virtue. It
is the nature of kings to crush the pride of others." ||4|| This very word,
clear and echoing, arose from the mouths of the Lokapalas. ||5|| Ravana,
laughing, said to the Lokapalas, "There is a condition. Only by fulfilling this
condition will I release Indra." ||6|| "From today onwards, all of you shall
perform the duties of my city, both inside and outside. ||7|| You shall keep
this city free from dust, impurities, stones, grass, and thorns every day."
||8|| "Indra, too, shall take a pitcher and water the earth with fragrant water.
This is his well-known duty in the world." ||9|| "And the adorned, dignified
goddesses shall decorate the city with fragrant flowers of five colors." ||10||
"If you agree to these conditions with respect, I will release Indra. Otherwise,
how can he be released?" ||11|| Saying this, Ravana looked at the Lokapalas, his
head bowed in shame, and laughed repeatedly, striking his hand against his palm.
||12|| Then, with humility, he said to Sahasrar, his words like nectar,
captivating the hearts of the assembly. ||13|| "O father! Just as you are
revered by Indra, so am I. In fact, even more so. Therefore, how can I disobey
your command?" ||14||

298 If there were not great teachers like you, then this earth would sink into
the abyss, like a mountain abandoned by its supports. ||15|| I am fortunate
because a revered person like you is giving me instructions.  Indeed, those who
are worthy of the instructions of people like you cannot be devoid of merit.
||16|| Therefore, O Lord, from today onwards, let us do something that will
bring about harmony between Indra and me. Let Indra be happy and let me also be
happy. ||17|| This powerful Indra is my fourth brother. By gaining him, I will
make the earth free from thorns. ||18|| Let his Lokapalas remain as they were
before, and let his kingdom also remain as it was before, or even let him take
more. What need is there for a difference between us two? ||19|| Just as you
give instructions to Indra, give me instructions on what I should do, because
the instructions of the teachers are like the protection and adornment of the
remaining body. ||20|| Stay here according to your wish, or stay in the city of
Rathnupura, or stay wherever you wish. We are both your servants, who is the
owner of this land? ||21|| Thus, with his mind soaked in the water of these
sweet words, Sahasrar spoke words even sweeter than those of Ravana. ||22|| He
said, "O Blessed One! The birth of noble people like you is accompanied by
qualities that bring joy to all beings." ||23|| O Auspicious One! Your excellent
humility is praised in this world, and it is like an ornament to your valor.
||24|| Your sight has made my birth meaningful. Those parents are blessed who
have you as the cause of their birth. ||25|| You, who are powerful yet
forgiving, and whose fame is as pure as the white lotus, have removed the fear
of the occurrence of faults. ||26|| It is as you say, everything is possible for
you. What cannot your arms, which are as thick as the trunks of elephants, do?
||27|| But just as a mother cannot be abandoned, so too cannot one's birthplace
be abandoned.

## The Thirteenth Chapter  299 Unable to leave their own land, their friends and
relatives remained there, like chatakas, filled with anxiety, looking towards
the path. ||29|| O Gunalaya, you too, following your lineage, are serving Lanka
and attaining supreme joy. What can be said about one's birthplace? ||30||
Therefore, we shall go to that very land, the source of great pleasures. May the
forest protect you, beloved of the gods, for a long time. ||31|| Having said
this, Indra, along with his son Sahasrar and the Lokapalas, went to the
Vijayadha mountain, accompanied by Ravana for a short distance. ||32|| All the
Lokapalas remained in their respective places as before, but due to the defeat,
they became devoid of essence, like moving machines. ||33|| Seeing the
Vijayavasi people, the gods, filled with immense shame, did not know where they
were going. Thus, the gods remained constantly depressed by their pleasures.
||34|| Indra did not find joy in the city, nor in the gardens, nor in the ponds
filled with lotus pollen water. In other words, due to the defeat, he found
nothing pleasing. ||35|| He did not even cast his simple gaze upon the women.
What to speak of his body? His mind was always filled with shame. ||36||
Although people, by introducing other topics of conversation, constantly tried
to make him forget his sorrow related to the defeat, his mind did not become
healthy. ||37|| Then, one day, Indra, sitting on the top of a pillar inside his
palace, resembling the peak of Mount Gandhamadana, was seated in the Jinalaya.
||38|| Wise men surrounded him. He, remembering the defeat constantly, was
holding his body with a sense of disrespect. While sitting, he thought: ||39||
Shame on this wealth, connected to knowledge, which, like a very high group of
clouds in the autumn season, vanished in a moment. ||40|| Those weapons, those
elephants, those warriors, and those horses, all became like grass due to my
previous wonder. ||41||

300 In the Padma Purana, or how else can a man describe the diversity of karma?
For all else is strengthened by karma. ||42|| Indeed, the karma I have
accumulated in the past, which is capable of bringing about the enjoyment of
various pleasures, has been exhausted, and that is why this state of affairs
exists. ||43|| It would be better to die in battle, in the midst of danger, than
to be disgraced, for disgrace spreads everywhere. ||44|| How can I, who has
placed his foot on the head of his enemies and lived, now enjoy the wealth
granted by my enemies? ||45|| Therefore, I abandon the desire for worldly
pleasures and worship the causes of attaining the state of liberation. ||46||
Ravana, my great friend, came disguised as an enemy, and he awakened me from my
attachment to the taste of this fleeting pleasure. ||47|| Meanwhile, a sage
named Nirvana Sangama, who was wandering through places suitable for virtuous
people, was traveling through the sky. ||48|| Suddenly, his progress was halted.
Then, looking down, he saw the temple. ||49|| The great sage, endowed with
direct knowledge, quickly descended from the sky to worship the Jina image
enshrined in the temple. ||50|| The king Indra, with great joy, had risen and
worshipped the Jina. The great sage, in accordance with the proper procedure,
paid homage to the Jina image. ||51|| Then, after the sage had worshipped the
Jina and sat down, Indra, bowing to his feet, sat in front of him and began to
criticize himself. ||52|| The sage, who was supremely skilled in making people
experience the course of the entire world, comforted him with excellent words.
||53|| Then Indra asked the sage about his past life. The sage, adorned with a
multitude of virtues, told him about his past life as follows: ||54|| O King!
You have wandered through countless births in the four realms of existence,
experiencing the great forest of suffering. In the city of Shikha Pada, you were
born as a human being. ||55|| You were born into a poor family, associated with
women, and you came with the name "Kulavanta," meaning "noble." ||56||

## The Thirteenth Chapter  A being wandering in the great forest of suffering,
attained the human realm in the city of Shikhapad. Born into a poor family, he
became known as "Kulavanta" due to his association with a woman. || 55-56 ||
Kulavanta's eyes were always filled with mucus, his nose was flat, and his body
was riddled with hundreds of diseases. Despite this, he had no means of
sustenance and survived by eating scraps left by others, a consequence of his
karmic actions. || 57 ||  His clothes were extremely dirty, misfortune followed
him, his entire body was rough, his limbs were torn, and his hair was
disheveled. Wherever he went, people harassed him. He could find no peace
anywhere. || 58 ||  In his final moments, with a good mind, he renounced food
for a moment, practicing non-consumption. Upon leaving his body, he became a
celestial being named "Kimpurusha," the son of a celestial woman named
"Kshiradhara." || 59 ||  From there, he was reborn in the city of Ratnapura as
the son of a couple named Dharani and Gomukha, named "Sahasrabhaga." || 60 ||
There, he attained the highest right faith and practiced the five vows. Upon
death, he became a celestial being named "Shukra" in the highest heaven. || 61
||  From there, he was reborn in the city of Ratnasamchaya in the Mahavideha
region, as the son of a minister named "Mani" and his wife "Gunavali," named
"Samantvardhana." || 62 ||  Samantvardhana renounced his king and became a
practitioner of the great vows. He practiced intense austerities, constantly
focused on the truth, endured hardships, attained pure right faith, and
conquered his passions. Upon death, he went to the Graiveyak heaven, becoming
"Ahamindra" and enjoying its pleasures for a long time. Finally, he was reborn
in the city of Rathanupura as "Indra," the king of the celestial beings, born to
the queen "Hridayasundari" of the celestial being "Sahasrar." || 63-66 ||  Oh
Indra! Though I am filled with knowledge, I was defeated by my enemy. Why are
you filled with sorrow, carrying this disrespect for yourself? || 67 ||  Oh
foolish one! You sow millet and desire rice in vain. Beings always receive
fruits according to their actions. || 68 ||  The actions you performed in the
past are the means for your enjoyment. It is not surprising that there is no
effect without a cause. || 69 ||

In the Padma Purana, It is only a cause, Ravana's defeat. What you have done in
this birth, you have received the fruits of it. ||70|| Why don't you remember
the injustice you did while playing? Your pride born of wealth is now destroyed.
Remember that now. ||71|| It seems that because of the long time, the story is
not coming to your mind. Therefore, listen with a focused mind, I say. ||72|| In
the city of Arijaipur, there was a Vidyaadhara king named Vahnivega. He had
arranged the Swayamvara of his daughter named Ahalya, born of Queen Vegavati.
||73|| All the Vidyaadharas, adorned with their respective wealth, came to the
Swayamvara, leaving their ranks out of eagerness. ||74|| You also went there,
endowed with excellent wealth, and so did Anandamal, the king of
Chandraavartapur. ||75|| Leaving all the Vidyaadharas behind, due to the
influence of your past karma, Anandamal was chosen by the beautiful girl. ||76||
After marrying her, he enjoyed the pleasures he desired, just as Indra enjoys
the ever-increasing pleasures in heaven. ||77|| From then on, you became
extremely hostile towards him, driven by intense jealousy. ||78|| Then, due to
the favorable nature of his karma, Anandamal suddenly realized that this body is
impermanent, and therefore, it is of no use to me. ||79|| I will do penance so
that the suffering related to the world will be destroyed. What is the use of
hoping for deceitful pleasures? ||80|| Having realized this deeply with his
enlightened inner self, he renounced all possessions and undertook the highest
penance. ||81|| Once, he was situated on the mountain named Rathaavarta, on the
bank of the Hansavali river, in the state of Pratimā Yoga. You recognized him.
||82|| The fire of your past anger, fueled by the sight of him, flared up. Then,
mocking him with pride, you laughed repeatedly. ||83|| 302 The karma earned in
the past has now been exhausted. What is the wonder in this, that without a
cause, there is no effect? ||69|| Ravana is only a cause in your defeat. You
have done karma in this birth, and you have received this defeat from them.
||70|| Why don't you remember the injustice you did while playing? Your pride
born of wealth is now destroyed. Therefore, remember the past now. ||71|| It

## The Thirteenth Chapter  303. You, the one who is excessively fond of sensual
pleasures, the husband of Ahalya, why are you sitting here like this?  || 84 ||
You, bound by ropes, yet your body remains unshaken like a mountain, your mind
steadfast in contemplation of the truth. || 85 ||  Seeing you being humiliated,
your brother, the virtuous Kalyan, standing nearby, was filled with sorrow and
anger. || 86 ||  He, possessing the power of the image-assembly, gathered it and
gave it to you. With a long, hot sigh, he cursed you, filled with sorrow. || 87
||  "You have scorned these innocent sages, and you will surely face great scorn
yourself." || 88 ||  He wanted to burn you with his immeasurable breath, but
your wife, Sarvasri, calmed him down. || 89 ||  She, with right vision, is a
worshiper of the virtuous. Even the sages respect her words, for they are of
pure heart. || 90 ||  If that virtuous woman had not calmed him down, who could
have stopped his fire of anger? || 91 ||  There is nothing in the three worlds
that cannot be achieved through penance. Indeed, the power of penance is supreme
over all powers. || 92 ||  Even Indra, the king of the gods, does not possess
the power, radiance, brilliance, or fortitude of a virtuous sage who acts
according to his will. || 93 ||  Those who scorn the virtuous face great
suffering in the animal realm and in hell. || 94 ||  Whoever, even in their
mind, brings about the defeat of the virtuous, receives supreme suffering in
this world and the next. || 95 ||  What can be said about a cruel-minded person
who insults or kills a liberated sage? || 96 ||  Whatever actions humans perform
with their body, mind, or speech, they will surely bear the fruits of those
actions. || 97 ||  Knowing the nature of actions and their consequences, both
good and bad, strengthen your resolve in Dharma and liberate yourself from
suffering. || 98 ||  You were playing and laughing at him out of arrogance. ||

304 Padmapurana Thus, remembering his past lives, Indra was filled with wonder.
Bowing down to the Nirgrantha, he said, "O Great One! ||19|| By your grace, I
have attained the supreme enlightenment. Now, I believe all my sins will vanish
in an instant." ||100|| "Nothing is unattainable in this world through the
association of the virtuous. The enlightenment that is not attained in many
births is attained through it." ||101|| Having said this, Indra bowed to the
Muni, who then went as he pleased. Indra also attained supreme detachment from
worldly life. ||102|| Knowing that Ravana attained the highest liberation
through the rise of virtuous karma, he praised the mighty Veerayantra, who
resides on the banks of the great mountains. ||103|| Realizing that human
existence is as fleeting as a water bubble, he made his mind firm in Dharma,
condemning his evil deeds. ||104|| The great Indra bestowed his kingdom upon his
son, Ratnanupura, and along with his sons and the group of Lokapalas, he took
the Jain initiation, which destroys all karma. His mind became completely pure,
and he renounced all possessions. ||105-106|| Even though his body was nurtured
by extraordinary pleasures like Indra's, he bore the burden of austerity that
others could not bear. ||107|| Generally, great beings possess extraordinary
power in their fierce actions, and the same power arises in pure actions.
||108|| After performing austerities for a long time, with pure meditation,
Indra destroyed his karma and attained Nirvana. ||109|| Dodhakavritta Behold
this picture of the deeds of men, full of strength and wonder. The pleasures
acquired over a long time again lead to the path of supreme happiness. ||110||
Consider the fruits of virtuous and sinful actions, and hold your mind in
Dharma, protecting yourself from suffering. ||98||

## The Thirteenth Chapter  **305**  There is nothing surprising in this, that
great men, abandoning all attachments, destroy their sins in an instant through
the power of meditation. ||111||  What great fire, fueled by a vast amount of
wood gathered over a long time, does not consume everything in an instant,
attaining immense glory? ||112||  Knowing this, O noble ones! Be diligent and
purify your inner selves. No one can escape the day of death, that is, everyone
must die when the time comes. Therefore, attain the sun of right knowledge.
||113||  Thus ends the thirteenth chapter of the Padmacharita, known as the
Ārṣa, narrated by the Ācārya, describing the Nirvāṇa of Indra. ||13||  And
finally, they attain the state of Nirvāṇa, filled with supreme bliss. ||110||
**Notes:**  1. *N্যস্ত* - abandoned 2. *ক্ষণমাत्र* - an instant

## The Fourteenth Chapter  **Then, Ravana, known as the lord of the gates, whose
mind was engrossed in worldly pleasures, whose actions were difficult for
enemies to achieve, and who was able to obtain whatever he desired, went to
Mount Meru.**  [1] **He worshipped the Jina and then returned at his own will.**
[2] **On his way back, he saw the various mountains that divided the earth,
adorned with diverse trees, and the rivers, more pure than crystal, flowing with
great beauty.** [3] **His chariot, shaped like the sun, was adorned with
exquisite ornaments, and he was accompanied by the supreme Lakshmi. He was eager
to reach Lanka.** [4] **Suddenly, he heard a loud, gentle sound, which filled
him with great excitement. He quickly asked Maricha:** [5] **"Oh Maricha,
Maricha! Where is this great sound coming from? And why are the directions
turning red like gold?"** [6] **Then Maricha said, "Oh Lord! This is the arrival
of the gods, who are going to attend the great auspicious event of a great
sage."** [7] **"The sound of the gods, filled with joy and moving in various
ways, is spreading throughout the world."** [8] **"These directions are filled
with the rays of their crowns and other ornaments, and they are shining with a
brilliance like that of the Kusumbha flower."** [9] **"It seems that the great
sage, Anantabala, who resides on this golden mountain, has attained Kevala Jnana
today."** [10]  **Hearing these words, Ravana, filled with the feeling of right
faith, was overjoyed.** [11] **He descended from the sky, radiating great
brilliance, like a second Indra, to pay homage to the great sage.** [12] **Then,
Indra and the other gods, with folded hands, bowed to the sage, praised him, and
sat down in their respective places, their bodies small and insignificant
compared to the great sage.** [13]

## Chapter Fourteen  307. Ravana, filled with great devotion, bowed and praised,
then sat down on the suitable ground, surrounded by the Vidyadharas. ||14||
Then, the Muni, revered like a disciple, asked Ravana, praised by the four types
of Devas, the Tiryanchas, and the humans: ||15||  "O Bhagavan! People desire to
know the fruits of Dharma and Adharma, and the cause of liberation for all. You
are worthy of explaining all this." ||16||  Then, the Muni, dear to all, spoke
words that were skillfully crafted, pure, full of meaning, concise, unbreakable,
and beneficial to all. ||17||  "Bound by the eight types of Karma, beginningless
and endless, this being, whose inner power is hidden by the Karma of knowledge-
obscuration, etc., ||18||  continuously experiences pleasure and pain in
countless lakhs of births, arising from various senses. ||19||  As the fruits of
Karma ripen, whether mild, medium, or strong, he becomes attached, hateful, or
deluded, and like a potter's wheel, he keeps revolving through the four states
of existence. ||20||  Even attaining the extremely rare human birth, he does not
understand his own welfare due to the Karma of knowledge-obscuration. ||21||
Subdued by the senses of taste and touch, beings perform highly condemnable
actions, becoming burdened with the weight of sin, and fall into hells, which
inflict great suffering arising from various causes, like stones sinking in
water. ||22-23||  Driven by wealth, etc., some people, condemned by the world,
kill their mothers, fathers, brothers, daughters, wives, and friends. ||24||
Some wicked people kill humans, birds, and deer, including those in the womb,
the old, the young, and women. ||25||  Those with minds deviated from Dharma,
with foolish intellect, kill land and water creatures, and all of them fall into
the terrible hell of Puruvedana. ||26||  Those who kill honeybees, are cruel,
are Chandala, set fire to forests, are devoted to violence, are sinful, are
Kaivarta, and are low-born greedy people, ||27||

## Padmapurana:  **Verse 28:** Those who are attached to false speech and are
eager to steal others' possessions, fall into a terrible hell, having abandoned
their refuge.  **Verse 29:** In whatever way they consume flesh, in the same way
they are consumed by others in hell.  **Verse 30:** Those who are attached to
great possessions, engage in grand endeavors, and are fiercely determined, dwell
in hell for a long time.  **Verse 31:** Those who hate the virtuous, are wicked,
associated with false views, and die with a fierce mind, surely go to hell.
**Verse 32:** Such beings are torn apart in hells by axes, swords, wheels,
claws, and other various weapons. Birds with sharp beaks peck at them.  **Verse
33:** Lions, tigers, dogs, snakes, scorpions, wolves, and other creatures born
of karma inflict great suffering upon them.  **Verse 34:** Those who are deeply
attached to objects like sound, are illusioned beings and attain the state of
animal life.  **Verse 35:** In that animal realm, beings kill each other, humans
slay them with various weapons, and they themselves experience great suffering
through carrying burdens, pulling carts, and so on.  **Verse 36:** This being,
wandering in the troubles of existence, sleeps on land, in water, on mountains,
on trees, and in other dense places.  **Verse 37:** This being, from time
immemorial, has been born with one sense, two senses, three senses, four senses,
and five senses, experiencing birth and death.  **Verse 38:** There is not even
a sesame seed-sized space where this being, caught in the whirlpool of
existence, has not experienced birth and death.  **Verse 39:** Some beings are
endowed with gentleness and simplicity, and are naturally content, and they
attain the human realm.  **Verse 40:** Even in the human realm, deluded beings,
for the sake of momentary pleasure, abandon the path of liberation and commit
sins, mistaking the cause of ultimate happiness.  **Verse 41:** According to
their past actions, some are Aryans and some are Mlechchas. Some are wealthy,
and some are poor.

## The Fourteenth Chapter  **309** Many beings, bound by karma, perform hundreds
of desires and spend their time with great difficulty in the homes of others.
**42** Some are wealthy but ugly, some are beautiful but poor, some have long
lives and some have short lives. **43** Some are beloved and possess fame, some
are extremely disliked, some give orders and some obey them. **44** Some enter
battle, some dive into water, some go to foreign lands, and some engage in
agriculture and other activities. **45** Thus, even in the human realm, there is
a variety of happiness and sorrow. In reality, all is sorrow, and happiness is
merely an illusion. **46**  Some beings are characterized by attachment and
restraint, some by restraint and non-restraint, some practice non-desire and
austerity, and some are deluded by their passions. **47** They attain the state
of godhood, endowed with the four blessings. Even there, some are endowed with
great powers, and some with limited powers. **48**  Based on their state,
radiance, influence, intellect, happiness, lightness, pride, and arrogance, they
again accumulate karma and continuously wander through the four realms of
existence. **49** Just as the wheel of an hourglass constantly turns, so too do
these beings constantly wander. **50**  Through evil intentions, a being
experiences sorrow, and through good intentions, it experiences happiness.
Through the destruction of the eight types of karma, a being attains liberation.
**51**  Through the power of giving, beings attain enjoyment in the realms of
enjoyment. They attain various forms through the specific qualities of their
vessels. **52**  The Jinas declare those who are free from violence, free from
attachment, and devoid of attachment and aversion to be the best vessels. **53**
A vessel that is purified by right faith, even without austerity, is also
praiseworthy, for it purifies the body of the one who holds false beliefs.
**54**  One who protects from calamities is called a vessel (paatiti paatra).
This is the etymological meaning of the word "vessel." Since the monks, through
the power of right faith, protect people, they are vessels. **55**  That which
is endowed with pure right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct is
considered the supreme vessel. **56**

## Padma Purana:  "He who is equal in honor and dishonor, in pleasure and pain,
and in grass and gold, is called a virtuous recipient. ||57|| Those who are free
from all attachments, are absorbed in great austerities, and are always devoted
to the contemplation of truth, are called Shramanas (ascetics) and are the best
recipients. ||58|| Whatever food, drink, medicine, or other things useful for
them are given to these Shramanas with devotion and according to their ability,
yield great results. ||59|| Just as a seed sown in fertile land yields abundant
wealth, so too does a gift given to a virtuous recipient with a pure heart yield
abundant wealth. ||60|| A recipient who is filled with attachment, aversion,
etc., is not a true recipient, and does not yield the desired result. Therefore,
it is pointless to think about the result of giving to such a recipient. ||61||
Just as a seed sown in barren land does not produce anything, so too does a gift
given to a sinful recipient who is attached to false views not yield any fruit.
||62|| Water drawn from a polluted well, if drunk by a sugarcane plant, becomes
sweet, but if drunk by a neem tree, becomes bitter. ||63|| Similarly, water from
the same lake, if drunk by a cow, becomes milk, but if drunk by a snake, becomes
poison. In the same way, a gift given to a virtuous recipient yields good
results, while a gift given to a wicked recipient yields bad results. ||64||
Some recipients, though attached to false views, are still imbued with the
spirit of right view. For such recipients, a gift given with devotion yields
mixed results, both good and bad. ||65|| Giving to the poor, the blind, etc., is
called compassionate giving, and though it may yield some results, it is not
considered the best kind of giving. ||66|| All those who wear the garb of
religion strive to preach their own doctrines, but those who have a pure heart
should carefully examine them. ||67|| Wealth given to householders who are equal
to oneself, but who are filled with lust, anger, etc., does not yield any fruit.

## The Four-Month Festival  **311** Alas! How great is this delusion that people
deceived by false doctrines give their wealth to those who are in all states of
existence! **69**  Shame on those wicked people who have deceived this innocent
creature, and by showing greed, have diverted his mind with the discussion of
false scriptures. **70**  Because it is sweet and forceful, wicked men have
declared meat to be edible, and to show their deceit, they have also determined
the number of those whose flesh should be eaten. **71**  Such cruel and greedy
beings, by feeding others meat and eating it themselves, go to hell along with
the givers, accompanied by terrible suffering. **72**  Many people, who are
under the influence of greed, have wicked intentions, and falsely consider
themselves to be sages, have also declared the donation of elephants, horses,
cows, and other living beings to be virtuous. But those who know the truth have
strongly condemned it. **73**  The reason for this is that the living being who
is given in a living donation has to carry burdens, his body is marked with
sharp tools, and he is beaten with sticks, etc. Due to these reasons, he suffers
great pain, and because of him, many other living beings also have to suffer
greatly. **74**  Similarly, land donation is also condemnable because it causes
suffering to the living beings living in that land. And to desire merit by
accumulating it through the suffering of living beings is like extracting water
from a stone. **75**  Therefore, all living beings should always be given the
gift of fearlessness, as well as knowledge, food, medicine, clothes, etc. **76**
Even the donation that is condemned becomes praiseworthy due to the difference
in the recipient. Just as water drunk through a conch shell becomes a pearl, for
sure. **77**  The donation of animals and land, although condemned, if given
with the intention of offering to the Jina image, etc., grants excellent
enjoyments that last for a long time. **78**  The inner intention is the cause
of merit and demerit. Without it, giving externally is like raining on the top
of a mountain. **79**  Therefore, who is capable of diminishing the fruit of the
donation given with the contemplation of the Jina, who is free from attachment
and omniscient? **80**  Except for the Jina, other gods are hateful, attached,
and deluded because:  1. In all types of recipients. 2. Wealth. 3. Due to pride.
4. The living beings living in it. 5. Knowledge, medicine, food, etc. 6.
Unreleased, released, becomes liberated. 7. Intention.

312 Those who hold weapons are considered hateful, those who keep women and wear
ornaments are considered passionate. Their delusion can also be inferred from
their passion and hatred, because delusion is the cause of passion and hatred.
Thus, passion, hatred, and delusion are the three vices that are established in
them, and the rest of the vices are transformations of these. || 42 || Some
people in the world are known as gods, but they are like ordinary people, they
eat, they are tainted by passions, and they indulge in desires like sex, time,
and place. How can such gods be worthy of charity? If they are inferior or equal
to their devotees, how can they give them good results? || 83-84 || Although
their good deeds are seen in the present, how can they bring liberation to other
suffering humans? || 85 || To desire liberation from such false gods is like
wanting to get oil by squeezing a handful of sand, or like wanting to quench
thirst by serving fire. || 86 || If a lame man can take another lame man to a
foreign country, then these gods can also bring results to other suffering
beings. || 87 || This is the story of these gods who commit sinful deeds. Their
devotees, who are far from being worthy, cannot be considered worthy in any way.
|| 88 || Driven by greed, sinful people engage in sacrifices, and people give
them money in the form of offerings. How can this be considered innocent? || 89
|| Therefore, the charity given with the intention of benefiting the Jina is
free from all vices and yields great results. || 90 || Religion is like
business, just as in business, there is always a consideration of more or less,
so in religion, there should always be a consideration of more or less, that is,
one should look at the loss and gain. A householder can accept the religion in
which there is more merit and less sin, because the greater thing overcomes the
lesser thing. || 91 || Just as a single grain of poison does not contaminate the
entire pond when it enters it, so also the slight violence committed by a man
who follows the Jina's religion does not contaminate him. His slight violence is
in vain. || 92 || 1. kechidebhyah m. | 2. bhajanbhajanam kh. | pujanbhajanam m.,

##  Translation:  **Chapter 14**  **Verse 93:**  Devout followers of the Jinas
should construct temples and other structures, and offer garlands, incense,
lamps, and other auspicious offerings.  **Verse 94:**  By offering donations
with the intention of benefiting the Jinas, beings attain the highest pleasures
in both the heavenly and human realms.  **Verse 95:**  Donations given
appropriately to those who have embarked on the path of liberation (like monks)
bestow abundant pleasures and are considered worthy of merit.  **Verse 96:**
Only the donation given with devotion and faith to those who have attained Right
Vision (Samyak Drishti) is true charity. The rest is merely a loss of wealth to
thieves.  **Verse 97:**  The kingdom of perfect knowledge (Kevala Jnana) is
established only through meditation. When one attains this perfect knowledge,
they achieve liberation (Nirvana).  **Verse 98-99:**  Those who have shed all
their karmas, are free from all obstacles, possess infinite bliss, and are
illuminated by infinite knowledge and vision, are the Siddhas. They are without
any physical body, remain in their true nature, reside on the peak of the
universe, are free from rebirth, and their essence cannot be described in words.
**Verse 100:**  Those who are trapped in the fire of suffering fueled by the
wind of greed, constantly suffer without the water of merit.  **Verse 101:**
Those who dwell in the darkness of sin and are under the influence of false
vision, some attain enlightenment through the rays of the sun of Dharma.
**Verse 102:**  Beings who are imprisoned within the strong cage of evil
tendencies and are bound by the ropes of desire, are liberated by the bond of
Dharma.  **Verse 103:**  The word "Dharma" is used in the context of "holding"
or "sustaining" as it is derived from the root "Dhr" (to hold) and is explained
by the example of the country "Lokabindu Sara" (a country mentioned in ancient
texts).  **Verse 104:**  Dharma is called "Dharma" because it sustains a being
from falling into misery, as it is the right conduct.  **Verse 105:**  The root
"Labh" means "to obtain" or "to gain". The benefit derived from Dharma is called
"Dharma Labh" (benefit of Dharma).

## Chapter 314  I will briefly explain the Dharma as stated by the Jinas. Listen
attentively, with a focused mind, to the different types of fruits that result
from it.  **Verse 106:**  Non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, non-
possession, and non-attachment are called vows. One should definitely practice
these vows.  **Verse 107:**  Walking, speech, desire, taking and giving, and
discarding are the five Samitis. A virtuous person should diligently practice
them.  **Verse 108:**  Complete absence or gentleness in speech, mind, and body
actions is called Gupti. One should practice it with utmost respect.  **Verse
109:**  Anger, pride, deceit, and greed are the four great enemies (Kashaya). It
is through these that a being wanders in the cycle of birth and death.  **Verse
110:**  According to the scriptures, one who acts according to the scriptures
should control anger through forgiveness, pride through gentleness, deceit
through simplicity, and greed through contentment.  **Verse 111:**  All that has
been described above, including vows, Samitis, etc., is called Dharma.  Beyond
this, renunciation is also called a special Dharma.  **Verse 113:**  Touch,
taste, smell, sight, and hearing are the five well-known senses. Conquering
these is called Dharma.  **Verse 114:**  Fasting, austerity, counting breaths,
renunciation of tastes, secluded sleeping and sitting, and bodily exertion are
the six external austerities. External austerities are like a house, protecting
the internal austerities.  **Verse 115:**  Penance, humility, self-reflection,
study, detachment, and meditation are the six internal austerities. All these
austerities are called Dharma.  **Verse 118:**  Through this Dharma, noble
beings achieve the separation (destruction) of karmas and perform many wondrous
actions that transform infinite activities.  **Verse 119:**  Through the
influence of Dharma, this being obtains a body capable of action, which enables
it to obstruct all humans and gods, and to permeate the space of the universe.
**Verse 120:**  Through the influence of Dharma, this being becomes so powerful
that it can conquer the three worlds. It attains the eight types of divine
powers and the rare Yoga.

The fourteenth vow  1. It destroys the heat of the sun, makes it like frost, and
fills the whole world with rain in an instant. || 121 || It burns the world to
ashes with its mere glance, like the poisonous snake, lifts Mount Meru, and
scatters the ocean. || 122 || It lifts the celestial wheel, frightens Indra,
Rudra, and other gods, rains jewels and gold, and creates groups of mountains.
|| 123 || It pacifies the most severe diseases with the dust of its feet, and
gives humans many other wondrous riches. || 124 || A being can do many other
difficult things through the power of Dharma. In truth, nothing is impossible
for Dharma. || 125 || Those who die with Dharma transcend the celestial wheel
and are born in the heavens of Saudharma and other abodes of virtue. || 126 ||
Some become ordinary gods, some become Indra, and some become Ahminndra, by
acquiring Dharma. || 127 || Through the power of Dharma, beings are born in
palaces made of gold, crystal, and lapis lazuli pillars, with walls of gold and
other precious metals that always shine, very high and with many floors. || 128
|| Their floors are made of various gems like ruby, yogurt-colored, and honey-
colored, with strings of pearls hanging down, and adorned with windows. || 129
|| Their edges are decorated with beautiful paintings of deer, yak, cows, lions,
elephants, and other animals. || 130 || They are equipped with moon-like halls,
adorned with flags and garlands, and their chambers are furnished with beautiful
beds and seats. || 131 || Those who practice Dharma are born in places like
vimanas, which are equipped with musical instruments, travel according to their
will, are accompanied by good companions, adorned with lotus and other
decorations, and whose brilliance eclipses the sun's radiance and the moon's
light. || 132-133 || Through the power of Dharma, beings obtain: 1. The moon. 2.
The dust of the feet. 3. Flags and garlands.  315

In the Padma Purana, it is said that a body free from dust, sweat, and disease,
**samoda**, **nayanabhiram**, **upapadaj** in origin, and **digantar** in
radiance, is obtained in the celestial abodes. This body is **samod**,
**nayanabhiram**, **upapadaj** in origin, and **digantar** in radiance. It is
also adorned with ornaments that cover the entire horizon with their brilliance.
Through the power of Dharma, Apsaras are obtained in heaven, whose feet are as
soft as lotus petals, whose nails are radiant, and whose red garments are
entangled in their anklets. Their thighs are as smooth as banana stems, their
knees are hidden within their muscles, their hips are adorned with belts, and
their gait is as graceful as that of an elephant. They are adorned with delicate
trivalis at their waists, and their breasts are like newly risen moons. Their
bodies are constantly bathed in the radiance of jeweled garlands, and they wear
delicate vines of malati flowers. Their hands are adorned with bracelets of
precious stones, and their fingers are as soft as ashoka leaves. Their necks are
like conch shells, their lips are covered with the brilliance of their teeth,
and their cheeks are like pure mirrors reflecting beauty. Their eyes are adorned
with thick, radiant ornaments, and their foreheads are adorned with pearls and
rubies. Their hair is black, fine, and soft like bees, their bodies are as soft
as reeds, and their voices are sweet. They are skilled in all forms of
treatment, their actions are beautiful, and their breath smells like the
fragrance of Nandana. They are skilled in understanding gestures, they bring
pleasure to the five senses, and they are capable of assuming any form. They
obtain these celestial forms through Dharma.

## Chapter 14  **Verse 147:** The gods, along with the apsaras, enjoy immense
pleasure born from the object of desire, where all the necessary equipment is
created simply by the power of thought.  **Verse 148:** The pleasure that is
experienced in the human realm, as well as in the realm of the Yantrikas, is all
declared by the Jina masters to be the fruit of Dharma.  **Verse 149:** Whatever
is experienced as pleasure in the upper, middle, and lower realms, by the
enjoyers, is all born from Dharma.  **Verse 150:** The protection of thousands
of human beings by a giver, enjoyer, and establisher of order, is to be
understood as the fruit born from Dharma.  **Verse 151:** The dominion of Indra
over thousands of gods adorned with beautiful ornaments is the fruit born from
Dharma.  **Verse 152:** The attainment of the Siddha-loka by those who are
adorned with the three jewels of Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right
Conduct, and who have destroyed the enemy of delusion, is the fruit of pure
Dharma.  **Verse 153:** Without obtaining a human birth, one cannot obtain this
Dharma. Therefore, the attainment of human birth is the most excellent of all
births.  **Verse 154:** Just as a king is the best among humans, a lion among
animals, and Garuda among birds, so too is human birth the best among all
births.  **Verse 155:** Dharma, which is the best in the three worlds and
bestows pleasure on all the senses, is performed only in the human body.
Therefore, the human body is the most excellent.  **Verse 156:** After wandering
through thousands of births as a crawling creature, a being may or may not
obtain a human birth.  **Verse 157:** Having obtained this rare human birth,
which is the cause of liberation from suffering, if a person does not practice
Dharma, they will again fall into the cycle of suffering.  **Verse 158:** Just
as a precious jewel lost in the ocean is difficult to find, so too is it
difficult to regain a lost human birth.  **Verse 159:** By performing Dharma
appropriately in this human life, all living beings attain the fruits of heaven
and beyond.  **Verse 160:** Having heard all this, Bhanukarna was very pleased.
With devotion, he bowed down to the lotus-eyed omniscient being and asked a
question with folded hands.

## The Padma Purana  **Chapter 162:** The Blessed One, I am still not satisfied
with the teachings I have received. Therefore, you should explain the Dharma in
detail.  **Chapter 163:** Then, the one with infinite strength, the Kevali,
said, "Listen to the special description of Dharma, by the influence of which,
the worthy beings are liberated from the cycle of birth and death."  **Chapter
164:** Dharma is said to be of two types, Mahavrata and Anuvrata, due to their
importance and the nature of the vows. The first, Mahavrata, is for the monks
who have renounced their household life, and the second, Anuvrata, is for the
householders who live in the world.  **Chapter 165:** I will now describe the
conduct of the great-souled monks who have renounced all possessions, a conduct
that is capable of destroying sins.  **Chapter 166:** In the Tirthankara of Muni
Suvrata Nath, who knows all things, there are many great souls who are filled
with the great fear of birth and death.  **Chapter 167:** Knowing the human
existence to be as useless as the castor oil plant, they have renounced
possessions and embraced the path of a monk.  **Chapter 168:** These virtuous
ones are always absorbed in the five great vows and are dedicated to attaining
the knowledge of the truth until the end of their life.  **Chapter 169:** These
courageous monks, with pure hearts, are always absorbed in the five assemblies
and the three secrets.  **Chapter 170:** Non-violence, truthfulness, non-
stealing, and the Brahmacharaya as prescribed in the scriptures, are only for
those who have no attachment to possessions.  **Chapter 171:** What possessions
can those wise ones have who do not even have attachment to their own bodies and
who rest diligently after sunset?  **Chapter 172:** Even with a possession as
small as a grain of mustard seed, the monks, who are free from attachment, are
extremely courageous and powerful like lions.  **Chapter 173:** They are free
from all restrictions, like the wind. Birds may have possessions, but the monks
do not even have a trace of attachment.  **Chapter 174:** They are free from the
contact of impurities, like the sky, their actions are highly commendable, they
are gentle like the moon and radiant like the sun.  **Chapter 175:** They are
deep like the ocean, courageous like Mount Meru, and like a frightened tortoise,
they keep their senses completely under control.

## Chapter Fourteen  **319**  "Those who are equal to the earth in their
forgiveness, free from the surge of passions, and endowed with eighty-four lakh
virtues, **[176]** who are adorned with eighteen lakh aspects of conduct as
expounded by the Jinas, who are supremely blessed with the power of austerity,
and ever focused on attaining liberation, **[177]** who are absorbed in the
meaning of the Jina's teachings, well-versed in the teachings of other
religions, who have crossed the ocean of scriptures, and who are the upholders
of Yama, **[178]** who are the creators of rules, free from arrogance, endowed
with various powers, and embodiments of great auspiciousness, **[179]** these
monks, adorned with all these virtues, who have subdued their karma, attain the
highest state of godhood. **[180]** Then, in two or three existences, they burn
away all impurities with the fire of meditation and attain the bliss of
liberation. **[181]** Now, I will explain the twelve-fold path of righteousness
for those who are confined in the cage of attachment and dwell in the household
life. Listen carefully. **[182]** For householders, there are five Anuvratas,
four Shikshavrata, three Gunavrata, and thousands of Niyamas to be observed as
far as possible. **[183]** Abstaining from gross violence, gross falsehood,
gross taking of others' possessions, sexual misconduct, and endless craving,
these are the five Anuvratas for householders. The Jina-kings have explained the
following contemplation for the protection of these vows. **[184-185]** Just as
my own body is dear to me, so too is the body of all beings dear to them.
Knowing this, a householder should show compassion to all beings. **[186]** The
Jina-kings have declared compassion to be the ultimate limit of righteousness.
For those whose minds are devoid of compassion, even a little righteousness will
not bear fruit. **[187]** Any speech that causes pain to others is considered
false, for truth is the opposite of this. **[188]** Killing, stealing, etc., in
this life lead to imprisonment, bondage, etc., and after death, they cause
various kinds of suffering in the lower realms. **[189]** Therefore, a wise
person should avoid these with all his might. How can one engage in actions that
lead to conflict between the two worlds?"

## Padma Purana  **191.**  A woman should be avoided like a venomous snake, for
she is a destroyer of men, being enslaved by greed.  **192.** Just as one feels
sorrow when another man touches one's wife, so should one understand this
arrangement for all.  **193.** One who indulges in sensual pleasures receives
great scorn in this very life, and after death, suffers unbearable pain in the
animal realm and hell.  **194.** One should always measure one's desires, for if
they are not controlled, they bring great sorrow. The example of Bhadra and
Kanchana is well-known in this regard.  **195.** There was a man named Bhadra
who sold wares. He vowed to possess only one dinar. Once, he found a purse on
the road. Although it contained many dinars, Bhadra, remembering his vow, took
only one out of curiosity and left the rest.  **196.** Another man named
Kanchana saw the purse and took all the dinars. The owner of the dinars was a
king. When he investigated, Kanchana was sentenced to death. Bhadra, however,
returned the dinar he had taken to the king, who honored him for it.  **197.**
**198.**  The three Gunavrata are: renunciation of worldly possessions and
punishments, limiting one's movement to specific directions, and controlling
one's consumption.  **199.** The four Shikshavrata are: performing Samayika with
effort, observing fasts, sharing food with guests, and practicing Sallekhana
when death approaches.  **200.** A Shraman who arrives at a home without giving
prior notice, is free from possessions, and is endowed with virtues like right
faith, is considered a guest.  **201.** One should offer such a guest food and
other necessities according to one's means, with respect and without greed. This
is called Atithisambhaag.  **202.**  A householder should abstain from honey,
alcohol, meat, gambling, eating at night, and sexual intercourse with
prostitutes.

321 Having performed the household dharma, the five who attain samadhi at the
time of death, attain the state of a Sudeva, having fallen from the state of a
Sumanyuṣya. ||203|| Having thus performed the observance within the eight
existences, becoming free from the bonds of the three jewels, they attain
siddhi. ||204|| Having attained the state of a human, which is difficult to
obtain, he who is unable to perform the prescribed conduct, yet has faith in the
teachings of the Jinas, is also a temple of Shiva. ||205|| Even by the
attainment of right faith alone, a human being, being the most excellent of all
beings, is freed from the fear of the terrible path. ||206|| He who naturally
performs prostrations to the Jinas, is the foundation of merit, and even a small
amount of sin does not attach to him. ||207|| He who even remembers the Jinas
with devotion, his evil karma is destroyed. All that was earned through
countless existences is immediately destroyed. ||208|| The houses, dreams, and
birds of omen of that person are always auspicious, who holds the Jina, the
jewel of the three worlds, in his heart. ||209|| He who utters the words "I bow
down to the Arhant," with devotion, is undoubtedly freed from all karma in a
short time. ||210|| The pure heart-lotus of the worthy being blossoms forth from
the contact of the rays of the story of the Jina-chandra. ||211|| He who
performs prostrations to the Arhant, Siddha, and Munis, is to be known as one
who has abandoned the world, dear to the followers of the good teachings.
||212|| He who makes an image of the Jina, draws a picture of the Jina, worships
the Jina, or praises the Jina, will not find anything difficult to obtain in the
world. ||213|| Whether he be a king, a householder, wealthy or poor, he who is
devoted to dharma is worthy of worship in all the worlds. ||214|| Those who are
endowed with great humility and are wise in the knowledge of what should be done
and what should not be done, are the leaders of householders through their
association with dharma. ||215|| Those who do not use honey, meat, and liquor,
are established in the beauty of householders. ||216||

## The Padma Purana:  **Verse 217:** Those who are filled with doubt, desire,
and uncertainty, whose souls are distant from the praise of others, and who are
devoid of praise for other doctrines, are the ones who hold the primary position
among householders.  **Verse 218:** Those who are adorned with fine garments,
exude a pleasant fragrance, have a pleasing appearance, are praised by the women
of the city, and walk while looking at the earth, having abandoned all vices,
are filled with good intentions, and are eager to perform good deeds, are those
who, while going to pay homage to the Jina, attain infinite merit.  **Verse
219-220:** Those who consider the property of others as insignificant as grass,
other men as equal to themselves, and other women as equal to their mothers, are
blessed.  **Verse 221:** "When will I take initiation and wander the earth? When
will I destroy my karmas and attain the abode of the Siddhas?" The person with a
pure mind who contemplates this every day, finds that his karmas, as if afraid,
do not associate with him.  **Verse 222-223:** Some householders attain
liberation in seven or eight births, while some others, with a pure heart,
achieve liberation in two or three births by performing intense austerities.
**Verse 224:** The average noble beings quickly attain great bliss, that is,
liberation. However, those who are incapable but know the path, attain great
bliss after some rest.  **Verse 225:** A person who does not know the path and
wanders a hundred yojanas a day, keeps wandering and does not reach the desired
place even after a long time.  **Verse 226:** Those whose faith is false, even
if they perform severe austerities, do not attain the state free from birth and
death.  **Verse 227:** Those who are corrupted by the three jewels (right faith,
right knowledge, right conduct), wander in the forest of the world, covered in
the darkness of delusion and filled with snakes of passions.  **Verse 229:** How
can one cross the ocean of existence if one has no virtue, no right faith, and
no noble renunciation?  **Verse 230:** In the flow of the Vindhya mountains,
where elephants as tall as mountains are swept away, the poor rabbits are
undoubtedly swept away.  **Verse 231:** Where even those who preach the wrong
path are swept away by the current of birth, old age, and death, what can be
said of their devotees?

## Chapter Fourteen  **323** Just as a stone cannot save another stone in water,
so a householder cannot save a householder who has come to him for refuge.
**232** Those who have burned away their sins through austerity and are light,
knowing the truth, they alone are able to save people through their teachings.
**233** This human realm is like a precious island in the vast ocean of samsara.
It is obtained with great difficulty. **234** Having reached this precious
island, wise people should take hold of the jewels of the vows, for they must
inevitably leave this body and pass through the cycle of existence. **235** Just
as someone grinds up jewels to obtain thread, so people grind up the jewels of
dharma for worldly things. **236** The body and everything else is impermanent,
there is no refuge in anyone, the body is impure, the soul is separate from the
body, it alone experiences pleasure and pain, contemplate the nature of samsara,
consider the diversity of the world, reflect on the vices of the asravas,
contemplate the glory of samvara, think of ways to exhaust past karma, consider
the rarity of enlightenment, and contemplate the greatness of dharma - these
twelve contemplations have been spoken by the Jina, they should be held in the
heart always. **237-239** Whoever practices dharma according to their ability,
will enjoy the fruits of that practice in the realms of gods and humans. **240**
Thus speaking, Bhanukarna asked the omniscient Anantbal, "O Lord, I now wish to
know about the vows and their distinctions." **241** In response, the Lord said,
"O Bhanukarna, pay attention and understand. Vows and austerity are not two
separate things." **242** One who is bound by vows is called an ascetic
according to their strength, therefore, a wise person should be engaged in vows
or austerity in every way. **243** Wise people should accumulate even a little
bit of merit, for just as drops of water falling together create great rivers
that flow to the sea, so too... **244** Whoever gives up food for even a moment
in the day, will receive the same fruit as a month-long fast. **245**

##  English Translation:  324 Padmapurana  It is said that there are ten
thousand years in heaven for those who enjoy the fruits of their actions.  ||
246 ||  The time spent in heaven by a great soul who has faith in Jainism and
performs the prescribed duties is equivalent to one *paly*. || 247 ||  After
falling from heaven, he attains excellent enjoyment in the human realm, just as
the *Upvanas* born into the lineage of ascetics did. || 248 ||  There was a girl
named *Upvana* who was unhappy and without family, and she made a living by
eating berries and other fruits. Once, she gave up food for a *muhurta*.  Due to
the influence of this vow, the king honored her greatly and after the vow, he
endowed her with great wealth. This incident made her mind very enthusiastic
about religion. || 249-250 ||  Whoever constantly follows the words of the Jina,
attains uninterrupted happiness in the afterlife. || 251 ||  Whoever gives up
food for two *muhurtas* every day, gets the fruit of two fasts in a month. ||
252 ||  Similarly, whoever gives up food for thirty *muhurtas* by increasing one
*muhurta* at a time, gets the fruit of three, four, etc. fasts. || 253 ||  One
should plan the *muhurtas* in the same way for *tela* and other fasts.  The
fruit of a longer period of abstinence should be said to be greater, according
to the increase in the cause. || 254 ||  Having attained the fruit of this rule
in heaven, beings are born as humans and perform wonderful deeds. || 255 ||  Due
to the remaining merit from enjoying the fruits in heaven, they become husbands
of noble women whose bodies are adorned with beauty, and who captivate minds
with their charming gestures. || 256 ||  Women who have fallen from heaven also
come to the human realm and, being served by great men, attain equality with
Lakshmi. || 257 ||  Whoever gives up food at sunset, especially a
*samyagdarshi*, attains special prosperity. || 258 ||  This being, due to this
religion, resides in a jeweled, radiant chariot in the midst of the Apsaras, for
a time equivalent to many *palyas*. || 259 ||

## Chapter Fourteen  **325** Having attained the rare human birth, one should be
devoted to the path of liberation. The duty of the great lord is to worship the
Jina. ||26||  **26** Whose throne, when occupied, makes a yojana of land golden,
and is served by gods, animals, and humans. ||26||  **262** Whose eight
miraculous powers and thirty-four great wonders manifest, and whose form is
radiant like a thousand suns, bringing joy to the eyes. ||262||  **263** The
wise devotee who bows down to such a great lord, the Jina, crosses the ocean of
existence in a short time. ||263||  **264** There is no other way for beings to
attain peace except by following this path, therefore, one should serve it
diligently. ||264||  **265** There are thousands of other paths, like the Go-
danda, which are associated with Kutirthas, and in which the careless beings are
deluded. ||265||  **266** There is no true compassion in those paths, as they
openly consume honey and meat, but in the path of the Jina, even a speck of
fault is not seen. ||266||  **267** It is completely worthy of abandonment in
this world, to torment one's soul with hunger during the day, and then consume
food at night, destroying the accumulated merit. ||267||  **268** Eating at
night is a sin, yet those who consider it a virtue have hearts hardened by evil
deeds, and their understanding is difficult. ||268||  **269** The lazy and
sinful being who eats when the sun is not visible, does not understand the path
to liberation. ||269||  **270** The sinful being, whose eyes are covered by
darkness and whose mind is filled with sin, eats flies, insects, and hair at
night. ||270||  **271** The one who eats at night eats with Dakinis, Preta,
Bhutas, and other vile creatures. ||271||  **272** The one who eats at night
eats with dogs, rats, cats, and other carnivorous animals. ||272||  **273** Or
what is the point of elaborating further? Eating at night makes everyone impure
and defiled. ||273||  **259** Sitting in the middle, one spends many moments in
contemplation. ||259||  **260** Therefore, those who have attained the rare
human birth and are devoted to the path of liberation, should worship the great
lord, Shri Jinendra Deva. ||260||

## Padma Purana  **Verse 274:** Those who eat after sunset are considered bound
by humanity, like animals, by the wise.  **Verse 275:**  One who is averse to
the teachings of the Jinas and eats day and night, how can he be happy in the
afterlife, being devoid of discipline and vows?  **Verse 276:**  A person devoid
of compassion, who insults the Jina-endras, will have a foul-smelling mouth in
another life.  **Verse 277:**  Whoever indulges in meat, alcohol, night-eating,
stealing, and another's wife, destroys both his present and future lives.
**Verse 278:**  One who eats at night will have a short lifespan, be poor,
afflicted with diseases, and devoid of happiness in the afterlife.  **Verse
279:**  Due to night-eating, this being experiences birth and death for a long
time, and suffers in the womb.  **Verse 280:**  The night-eater, with a
distorted vision, is born for a long time in the wombs of boars, wolves, cats,
swans, crows, and other species.  **Verse 281:**  The foolish one who eats at
night suffers in many evil wombs for thousands of years during the Utsarpini and
Avasarpini periods.  **Verse 282:**  One who attains Jain teachings and adheres
to the vows, burns all his sins and attains a good place.  **Verse 283:**  Those
who are devoted to the three jewels and the Anuvratas, eat only after sunrise,
free from any faults.  **Verse 284:**  These sinless beings attain the position
of celestial rulers in the heavens, enjoying excellent pleasures. They are
filled with compassion and do not eat at night.  **Verse 285:**  After falling
from there, they attain human birth, free from slander, and enjoy the pleasures
of a Chakravarti king and other such positions.  **Verse 286:**  Those who
perform good deeds attain excellent pleasures and the eight Siddhis
(perfections) in the heavens like Saudharma, etc., which are present as soon as
they are desired.  **Verse 287:**  Those who eat during the day become great
ministers, kings, rulers of the earth, and beloved by all beings, working for
the welfare of the world.  **Verse 288:**  Those who eat during the day become
wealthy, virtuous, beautiful, long-lived, endowed with the three jewels, and
occupy high positions.

The fourteenth day is the day of the powerful, the rulers of cities and so on,
who are adorned with magnificent vehicles and are honored by their vassals.
||28|| The lords of palaces, the lords of the gods, those who are endowed with
the power of the wheel, and those who are endowed with great auspicious signs,
are born from eating during the day. ||290|| Those who are steadfast in the
renunciation of night-eating are radiant like the sun, gentle like the moon, and
possess enduring pleasures. ||291|| Women who eat at night become orphans,
unfortunate, deprived of parents and brothers, and filled with sorrow and
poverty. ||292|| Those with flat noses, whose appearance inspires disgust, whose
eyes are filled with dirt, and who are marked by many evil omens; ||293|| those
whose bodies emit a foul odor, whose lips are cracked and thick, whose ears are
erect, whose hair is yellow and brittle, whose teeth are like gourd seeds, and
whose bodies are white; those who are blind, weak, and lacking luster, with
rough skin; ||294-295|| those who are filled with many diseases, unclean, and
wear torn clothes; those who live on scraps and depend on the work of others,
are born from the sin of eating at night. ||296|| Women who are devoted to
night-eating obtain husbands who are deaf, lame, and devoid of wealth and
brothers. ||297|| Those who are constantly burdened with sorrow, become widows
in childhood, carry water, wood, and other burdens, struggle to fill their
stomachs, are despised by all, whose minds are destroyed by the weapon of
speech, and whose bodies are covered with hundreds of wounds, are born from the
sin of eating at night. ||298-299|| Women who are peaceful in mind, virtuous,
benevolent to the wise, and abstain from eating at night, obtain desired
pleasures in heaven. They are always surrounded by their families, who stand
with their hands on their heads, awaiting their commands. ||300-301|| Having
fallen from heaven, they are born into a prosperous and noble family, endowed
with auspicious signs and possessing all virtues. ||302|| They are skilled in
many arts, their bodies inspire love in the eyes and minds of others, and they
release nectar through their words, delighting all beings. ||303||

Here is the English translation, preserving the Jain terms:  The lords of the
Vidyadharas are filled with longing for them. Narayana, Baladeva, and the
Chakravartis also [long for them].   They have bodies radiant like lightning and
lotus flowers, with swinging, lovely earrings. They have connections with kings
through marriage.  The compassionate ones who do not eat at night receive their
desired food, prepared by servants.  Through daytime eating, they become like
Sri Kanta, Suprabha, Subhadra, and Lakshmi - women with great beauty.
Therefore, whether man or woman, one should abandon nighttime eating, which is
associated with many dangers, with a mind steadfast in discipline.  With little
effort, happiness is obtained. Who does not desire their own happiness?  Knowing
that "Dharma is the root of happiness, and adharma is the cause of suffering,"
one should engage in dharma and abandon adharma.  It is well known in the world
that through dharma comes happiness, and through its opposite, suffering.
Observe the greatness of dharma, by which humans, fallen from heaven, are born
among humans with great enjoyments and charming bodies.  They are the refuge of
jewels born from water and land. Even when indifferent, they are always happy.
Their storehouses of gold, cloth, grains, and other goods are constantly guarded
by those with diverse weapons in their hands.  They have abundant cows,
buffaloes, elephants, horses, chariots, servants, villages, towns, and palaces.
A large retinue, endowed with great fortune and capable of seizing the objects
of the mind and senses.  They have the gait of swans, bodies of dense beauty,
sweet voices, full breasts, and excellent characteristics.  Their youthful forms
are like fences for the eyes, with charming movements, adorned with various
ornaments, and possessing the nature of meritorious deeds.

## Chapter Fourteen  **329**  Some ignorant people, unaware of the path to
Dharma, do not strive for it, being foolish and unrighteous. **319**  Due to the
influence of their evil karmas, some humans, even though they are wise, do not
follow the path to Dharma, being engrossed in evil deeds. **320**  When the evil
karmas that hinder good deeds are pacified, some beings, with a sincere desire,
approach a Guru and inquire about Dharma. **321**  The words of the Guru become
meaningful for those who, after the pacification of their impure karmas, engage
in righteous conduct. **322**  Those wise beings who abandon evil deeds and
follow this rule become either the first or the second in heaven, possessing
great virtues. **323**  Those who, out of devotion, spend their time serving the
monks and then eat, are always desired by the gods in heaven to be happy.
**324**  Those with great brilliance become the Indra of the assembly of gods,
or they attain the status of a Samanika, fulfilling their desires. **325**  Just
as a small seed of a banyan tree grows into a tall tree, similarly, even a small
amount of tapasya bears the fruit of great enjoyment. **326**  One who is
constantly devoted to Dharma, due to the influence of their past good deeds,
becomes a handsome person with captivating eyes, like Kubera. **327**  A man
named Sahasrabhata, who had adopted the Munivelavrata (eating after the monks
have finished), once offered food to a Muni. As a result, his house was showered
with jewels, and he became Kubera in his next life. **328**  He was famous
throughout the earth, with a noble character and great strength, possessing
immense wealth and surrounded by servants. **329**  Like the full moon, his body
was extremely beautiful, and he enjoyed the highest pleasures, being
knowledgeable in all scriptures. **330**  Due to the influence of his past good
deeds, he attained supreme dispassion and received the great initiation from the
mouth of Jinendra. **331**  And the beautiful maidservants are obtained as a
result of good deeds. **315-318**

The Padma Purana states:  Those who await the time of the great ascetics, they
enjoy pleasures like the Harishena Chakravarti. (332)  Harishena, having waited
for the time of the ascetics, accumulated great merit, and thus attained the
highest Lakshmi. (333)  Those who, with pure vision, are inspired by the thought
of meditation, approach the ascetic and become one-minded, (334)  They spend
their time in unity and attain liberation. They are born in celestial vehicles,
adorned with the brilliance of jewels. (335)  With pure hearts, they dwell in
those celestial vehicles, illuminated by eternal light, and play amidst the
apsaras for a long time. (336)  Those who wear fine garlands, have beautiful
bracelets on their wrists, wear a belt around their waist, a crown on their
head, and are attended by umbrellas and fly whisks, are such gods, due to the
influence of the one-minded vow. (337)  Those who are attached to the highest
vows and observe the Anuvrata, knowing the impermanence of the body, and whose
hearts are peaceful, (338)  They fast on the eighth and fourteenth days with a
pure mind, and thus bind themselves to the long life of Trivishtapa. (339)  Some
of them are born in the heavens of Saudharma, etc., some attain the position of
Indra, and others, due to their purity, attain liberation. (340)  Those who are
constantly humble, endowed with good qualities and character, and whose minds
are always engaged in austerity, undoubtedly go to heaven. (341)  There, they
enjoy pleasures according to their desires, become human, enjoy great kingdoms,
and embrace the Jain faith. (342)  Having embraced the Jain faith, they
gradually adopt the character of the ascetics, and through its influence, attain
the abode of the liberated, free from all karma. (343)  Whoever, with mind,
speech, and body, praises and bows to the Jinas in the three periods of time,

## Chapter Fourteen  **331** Adorned with thirty-three qualities, fragrant with
good character, he enjoys pleasures that conquer all senses in the abode of the
gods. **345**  **346** After dwelling for a while in the two auspicious paths of
humans and gods, he departs for the supreme abode, free from all karmas.
**347** For, the objects of the five senses have been practiced for a long time
by all beings, and thus, blinded by them, they are unable to renounce them.
**347**  **348** Here is a great wonder: even after seeing those objects as
poisonous, the best of men still practice the karma that leads to liberation.
**348**  **349** Even a single renunciation, made by a being with right faith,
while wandering in the world, becomes the seed of liberation. **349**  **350**
Those who have no rules at all are animals, or like broken pots without ropes
(i.e., devoid of virtues like vows and conduct). **350**  **351** A being who is
rich in virtues and vows, and who follows the rules, should be free from
carelessness if he desires to cross the ocean of existence. **351**  **352**
Those humans who are poor in intellect and do not abandon evil deeds wander in
the wilderness of existence like the blind for a long time. **352**  **353**
Then, those who were present there, whether animals, humans, or gods, attained
supreme joy from the contact of the rays of the words of the infinite-powered
Kevali, like the moon. **353**  **354** Some attained right faith, some became
followers of the minor vows, and some became strong upholders of the great vows.
**354**  **355** Then, the Muni named Dharma-ratha spoke to Ravana, saying, "O
worthy one, take some rules according to your ability." **355**  **356** "This
Muni is an island of Dharma-gems, so take at least one gem of rules from him."
**356**  **357** "Why are you sitting here burdened with worry? For the great
ones, renunciation is not a cause of sorrow in their minds." **357**  **358**
"Just as the mind of a man who enters the island of gems wanders, 'Should I take
this or that?' so too, his mind is agitated in this island of conduct." **358**

##  Translation:  332 In the Padma Purana, his mind was overwhelmed with
anxiety. The one who was attached to pleasures was filled with restlessness.
||359|| My food is naturally pure, fragrant, delicious, substantial, and free
from the contact of flesh and other impurities. ||360|| I am not capable of
observing even one of the vows of householders, such as refraining from killing
large animals, etc. What to speak of other vows? ||361|| My mind, like a
maddened elephant, runs after all things. I am not able to control it with my
own will, like a hand. ||362|| One who desires to observe the vow of liberation
wants to drink the flame of fire, bind the wind in cloth, and lift Mount Meru.
||363|| Even though I am a valiant hero, I am not capable of observing the vow
of austerity. How wonderful it is that the best of men observe this austerity!
||364|| Should I adopt this rule: "Even if a woman is beautiful, I will not
force myself upon her if she does not desire me?" ||365|| Or, how can such
strength be in me, a lowly person? I am not even capable of controlling my own
mind. ||366|| Or, is there no woman in the three worlds who, upon seeing me,
would not be overcome with desire and restlessness? ||367|| How can a man, who
is worthy of honor and virtue, find contentment in the body of a woman who is
polluted by the touch of another man, who has lips marked by the wounds of
another man's teeth, who is naturally foul-smelling, and who is a mass of
impurities? ||368-369|| Having considered this, Ravana first bowed down to the
Kevali of infinite power with reverence. Then, in the presence of the gods and
demons, he declared clearly: ||370|| "O Lord! I have made this firm vow: I will
not take a woman who does not desire me." ||371|| Bhanukarna (Kumbhakarna), who
was listening to all this and whose mind was as steady as Mount Meru, also
adopted this vow, taking refuge in the four refuges. ||372|| The man who had
entered the city was wandering around in extreme anxiety, thinking, "Should I
take this vow or that vow?" ||358|| Then, a heavy anxiety arose in the mind of
Ravana, whose mind was always attached to pleasures and who was therefore filled
with restlessness. ||359||

The Fourteenth Chapter 333 I will rise early every day and perform the daily
rituals. I will praise and worship the Jinas with abhisheka. ||373|| I will not
eat until I have performed the rituals for the Nirgrantha gurus. ||374|| I will
prostrate to the Muni with my knees touching the ground, showing him respect. I
will also take on other great vows. ||375|| Then the gods, the celestial beings,
and the devotees, with their eyes wide open, bowed to the Muni and went to their
respective abodes. ||376|| Ravana, with his great strength, flew up into the
sky, imitating the play of Indra, and went towards Lanka. ||377|| Ravana, who
had been worshipped by a group of beautiful women, entered his city, adorned
with clothes and other ornaments. ||378|| Entering his dwelling, which was
adorned with all kinds of splendor, he stayed there, like the unclothed god in
the deep cave of Mount Meru. ||379|| When the karmas of embodied beings become
pacified, they attain liberation. Then they receive the supreme teachings from
the mouth of their guru. ||380|| Knowing this, O awakened and energetic beings,
you should always be eager to listen to the Jina Dharma. For those who listen to
the Dharma with humility, they attain vast knowledge like the sun. ||381|| Thus
ends the fourteenth chapter of the Padmacharita, known as the Arsha, narrated by
the Acharya Ravishena, which describes the Dharma teachings given by the Kevali
Anantbala. ||14|| 1. Worship. 2. Nirgrantha gurus. 3. Like the unclothed god. 4.
Related to Mount Meru.

## The Fifteenth Chapter  The Muni (sage) Gautama, Hanumaan, and Vibhishana,
with their minds firmly set, took the vows of householders. ||1||  The wise do
not praise the stability of Mount Sumeru as much as they praise the unwavering
character and right vision of Hanumaan. ||2||  Thus, when Gautama praised
Hanumaan with words of auspiciousness, the king Shrenik, his body trembling with
excitement, said: ||3||  "O Lord of the assembly! Who is Hanumaan? What are his
special qualities? Where and from whom did he originate? O Lord, I wish to know
his true character." ||4||  Then, the assembly leader, whose heart was filled
with joy at the mention of the virtuous, spoke in a voice that brought delight:
||5||  "O King! In the southern range of the Vijaya mountain, after crossing ten
yojanas, lies a beautiful city called Aditya-pura. There, the king was named
Prahlad and his queen was Ketumati." ||6-7||  "From them was born a son named
Pavana-Gati, whose broad chest was made the dwelling place of Lakshmi." ||8||
"Seeing him in the fullness of youth, his father, fearing the loss of his
lineage, was worried about his marriage." ||9||  "O King! Let this story rest
for now. Hold another story in your heart, so that the discussion of Pavana-
Gati's marriage can continue." ||10||  "At the end of this Bharat-kshetra, near
the ocean, in the southeast direction, lies a mountain called Danta." ||11||
"It is adorned with towering, shining peaks, covered with various trees and
herbs, and its vast shores are filled with excellent waterfalls." ||12||  "On
this mountain, a Vidhyadhara named Mahendra, possessing the prowess of Indra
himself, established a magnificent city." ||13||

## The Panchavarsha Parva (Chapter 335)  From that point onwards, the mountain
was called Mahendragiri and the city was known as Mahendranagara. ||14||  King
Mahendra, overcome with joy, had a hundred virtuous sons born to his queen,
starting with Aridam. ||15||  Their younger sister, known as Anjanasundari, was
born. She seemed to be the embodiment of beauty from all three worlds, as if her
form was created from the collective beauty of all the women in the universe.
||16||  Her complexion was as beautiful as a blue lotus, her hands were adorned
with graceful palms, her feet resembled the inner part of a lotus, and her
breasts were like the cheeks of an elephant. ||17||  Her waist was slender, her
hips were full, her legs were well-proportioned with beautiful knees, and her
body was adorned with many auspicious marks. Her arms were as soft as the
garland of a blooming jasmine. ||18||  Her eyes, reaching up to her ears, were
adorned with captivating pupils, and they seemed like the far-reaching arrows of
Kamadeva (the god of love). ||19||  She was knowledgeable in the arts of
Gandharvas and others, and she seemed like Saraswati herself. She was also
endowed with virtues and resembled Lakshmi in her beauty. ||20||  Once, she was
playing with a ball, moving around in circles, when her father saw her. He
noticed that her body was adorned with the beauty of youth. Just as King
Akampan, who was devoted to virtue, was deeply distressed about finding a
suitable husband for his daughter Sulochana, so too was King Mahendra worried
about finding a suitable husband for his daughter. This is natural, as the
sorrow of a daughter is a source of great anxiety for proud men. ||21-23||  A
father is always worried about his daughter: will she find a good husband? Will
he be able to make her happy for a long time? Will she remain free from faults?
Indeed, a daughter is a great source of worry for a man. ||24||  Then, King
Mahendra, adorned with the ornament of knowledge, called all his friends, who
were also adorned with knowledge, and went to a secluded house to decide on a
suitable husband for his daughter. ||25||  There, he addressed his ministers,
saying, "Oh ministers! You are all knowledgeable and wise. Therefore, tell me
who would be a suitable husband for my daughter." ||26||

One of the ministers, the counselor, spoke up and said, "My firm opinion is that
this maiden should be given to Ravana, the lord of the Rakshasas, the ruler of
the Bharata land." ||27|| "By obtaining Ravana as a relative, the lord of all
the Vidyadharas, your influence will spread throughout the earth, even to the
ends of the oceans." ||28|| "Or, O King, if you wish, give her to Indrajit or
Meghnad, the younger sons of Ravana. Even by giving her to them, Ravana will be
a relative." ||29|| "Or, if this is not to your liking, then let the maiden
choose her own husband, that is, hold a Swayamvara. By doing so, you will not
create any enemies." ||30|| Having said this, the minister of the Amarsagar
remained silent. Then, a wise minister named Sumati spoke clearly. ||31|| He
said, "Ravana has many wives, and he is very arrogant. Even if he gets her, he
will not develop any affection for us." ||32|| "Although this supremely powerful
and pleasure-seeking Ravana has the form of a sixteen-year-old boy, his age is
much greater." ||33|| "Therefore, I do not think it is appropriate to give him
the maiden. On the other hand, if you give the maiden to Meghnad, Indrajit will
be angry, and if you give her to Indrajit, Meghnad will be angry. Therefore,
neither of these suitors is suitable." ||34|| "It is said that there was a great
war between the sons of King Srishena over a courtesan, which caused great
sorrow to their father. It is true, for what cannot happen because of a woman?"
||35|| Then, a minister named Taradharayana, whose heart was filled with good
intentions, approved of the previous minister's words and spoke as follows.
||36|| He said, "To the south of the Vijayadhip mountain range, there is a city
called Kanakpur. There lives King Hiranyabha, whose queen's name is Sumana."
||37|| "They had a son named Saudamini, who was very handsome, with great fame,
brilliance, and age." ||38|| "He is a master of all knowledge and arts, a
festival for the eyes of the people, unparalleled in his qualities, and his
actions are pleasing to all." ||39||

The fifteenth chapter  All the celestial beings and vidyadharas, even united,
could not conquer him by any means. It seems as if he was created by gathering
the power of the three worlds. ||40|| If you agree, let this maiden be given to
him, so that a union of worthy couples may be produced for a long time. ||41||
Then the minister named Sandehaparaga, shaking his head and closing his eyes for
a long time, spoke the following words. ||42|| He said, "This one is a future
great being, and he constantly thinks, 'Where did my ancestors go?' So it seems
that knowing the nature of the world, he will attain supreme detachment." ||43||
This young man, whose soul is unattached to worldly objects, will abandon the
householder's state at the age of eighteen, breaking the great illusion of
enjoyment. ||44||  He, with a great mind, will abandon both external and
internal attachments, and attaining perfect knowledge, will attain Nirvana.
||45||  Just as the night becomes devoid of beauty when it is devoid of the
moon, which illuminates the world, so this maiden will become devoid of beauty
when she is separated from him. ||46||  Therefore, listen! There is a city
called Aditya-pura, beautiful like Indra's city, shining like the sun with
jewels. ||47||  In it lives a king named Prahlada, who is full of enjoyments and
appears like the moon among the vidyadharas. Prahlada's queen is Ketumati, who
is adorned like the banner of Kamadeva due to her beauty. ||48||  They have a
son named Pavananjay, who is very powerful, handsome, an ocean of virtues, and
adorned with ornaments like the eyes. ||49||  His very tall body is filled with
many auspicious signs. He is a home of arts, a hero, and free from evil deeds.
||50||  He is enshrined in the hearts of all people, and even in a hundred
years, his entire collection of virtues cannot be described. ||51||  Or, the
knowledge that is imparted through words remains unclear. Therefore, go and show
this one, who has the radiance of a god. ||52||

Here is the English translation of the provided text, while maintaining the
Sanskrit words:  ---  338   In the Pappapurana, thereafter, having reached the
paths of the ears through the qualities of the Kaitan Matā, all were filled with
supreme joy, revealing inward delight. 53. Having heard this news, even the
maiden blossomed with delight, like the kumudini (water lily) upon merely seeing
the rays of the moon. 54. Meanwhile, at that very moment, the time of the spring
season arrived, and the cold season was energized to capture the beauty of the
women's lotus-like faces. 55. The Kamalini (lotus) bloomed, and new clusters of
lotuses, having long anticipated, began to mix with the gathering of bumblebees.
56. The dense foliage, flowers, and sprouts were produced abundantly, seemingly
vibrating with the embrace of the goddess of spring. 57. The honey-drenched
blooms created a melody that pierced the hearts of people, akin to the arrows of
Kamadeva (the god of love). 58. The sweet calls of the cuckoos, which disrupt
the pride of women, began to evoke a sense of agitation in the people, as if the
spring itself were engaged in conversation. 59. The lips of the women,
previously affixed with pain from their husbands' bites, now experienced a
refreshing clarity after a long time. 60. A heavy affection began to manifest
among the beings of the world, apparent through their altruistic deeds. 61. The
wandering bumblebee, with the wind of its wings, began to relieve a tired
bumblebee from its exertions. 62. At that time, a buck was uprooting tender
grass for the doe, which brought her delight akin to receiving nectar. 63. The
elephant was scratching itself for the comfort of the female elephant. In this
act, its mouth's foliage fell and the female elephant's eyes closed with
pleasure. 64. The vine-like women, with clusters of breasts leaning down and
hands like leaves swaying, embraced the tree-like men with the bees perched upon
their eyes. 65.   From the southern direction emerged the Malaya (a fragrant
wind).   1. This is Kaitan Matā.   2. The qualities of Kaitan Matā.   3.
Bumblebee.   4. Of the arrows of love.   5. Manifesting beauty.   6. Emerging.
7. As the buck scratches.   8. The mouth fell.   9. The comfort of the female
elephant.   10. They embraced equally.   11. Emerging from the mouth.    ---

## Panchadarsha Parva ### 339  **67.** The saffron-colored flowers, trembling
due to the wind, were falling down. The travelers saw them as the locks of
Madhusinha.  **68.** The saffron of the Ankola tree, shining brightly, was
terrifying to the women, like the fangs of the spring lion or the goad of the
elephant of pride.  **69.** The dense network of Ketaki flowers, buzzing with
bees, seemed to be spread by spring to attract the hearts of the separated
women.  **70.** The Asoka tree, adorned with buds, was swaying with its new
leaves. It seemed like a mass of love, ignited by the abundance of beauty.
**71.** The dense Kinshuka trees, shining brightly in the forests, seemed like
the flames of sorrow that remained in the hearts of the separated women.
**72.** Spring, with its pollen born from flowers, spread across the entire
horizon, as if celebrating a grand festival with fragrant powder.  **73.** When
lovers, bound by the chains of love, cannot bear even a moment's separation, how
can they endure being separated by distance?  **74.** Inspired by devotion to
the Jinas and filled with great joy, the gods, led by Nandishvara, set out to
the island of Nandishvara on the eighth day of the Phalguna month.  **75.** At
that time, the king of the Vidyadharas, accompanied by his servants carrying
offerings, went to Mount Kailasa.  **76.** The mountain was highly revered
because of the liberation of Lord Rishabhadeva. Filled with devotion, King
Mahendra, along with his family, also went there.  **77.** After offering
worship, praise, and salutations to the Jina with devotion, the glorious King
Mahendra sat comfortably on the golden stone platform.  **78.** At that time,
King Prahlada also went to Mount Kailasa to worship the Jina. After completing
his worship, he wandered around and saw King Mahendra.  **79.** Seeing his son,
whose eyes were blooming and whose mind was filled with joy, King Mahendra, with
great affection, welcomed him with open arms.  **80.** King Mahendra, rising up
with joy, embraced Prahlada, the cause of his happiness, with a warm embrace.

340 In the Padma Purana, the two kings, Mahendra and Prahlad, sat down
comfortably on a beautiful stone platform and inquired about each other's well-
being. ||8|| Mahendra then said, "My dear friend, how can I be well when my mind
is constantly troubled by the thought of finding a suitable match for my
daughter?" ||82|| "I have a daughter who is ready for marriage, but I am
constantly wondering who I should give her to. My mind is restless." ||83||
"Ravana has many wives, and his sons, Indrajit and Meghanada, would be angry if
I gave my daughter to one of them. Therefore, I am not interested in them."
||84|| "In the city of Hemapura, there is a son of King Kanakadyuti named
Vidyutprabha. He will attain Nirvana in a few days." ||85|| "This news has been
spread by a knowledgeable sage, and it is known throughout the world. I have
also heard about it." ||86|| "Therefore, after consulting with my council of
ministers, I have decided that your son, Pavananjay, should be the one to marry
my daughter." ||87|| "O Prahlad, you have come here and fulfilled my desire. I
am overjoyed to see you." ||88|| Prahlad, who was delighted to have his wish
fulfilled, said, "My dear friend, I am also concerned about finding a suitable
bride for my son." ||89|| "Your words have given me a sense of peace that cannot
be expressed in words." ||90|| Then, the fathers of Anjana and Pavananjay
expressed their desire to hold their wedding ceremony on the beautiful banks of
the Manasa mountain. ||91|| Therefore, their armies, which were equipped with
tents and filled with the sounds of elephants, horses, and foot soldiers, were
stationed there. ||92|| The astrologers, who knew the movements of all the
celestial bodies, declared that the wedding would be auspicious after three
days. ||93|| Pavananjay had heard from his people that Anjana was a beautiful
woman, and he could not bear to wait three days to see her. ||94|| Mahendra
immediately got up and welcomed Prahlad with a warm embrace, expressing his joy.
||80|| After that, both kings sat down comfortably on a beautiful stone platform
and inquired about each other's well-being. ||81||

### Translation to English  **15**  This wind-born (pavananjaya), who is
tormented by the ten passions arising from lust, has become filled up like a
warrior in battle fully struck by arrows.   **96**  In the first passion,
thoughts concerning lust arise, leading to a desire for enjoyment. In the second
passion, there is a craving to see the external form.  **97**  In the third
passion, there is a slow, deep, and hot exhalation. In the fourth, a fever
arises that feels like the burning of sandalwood.   **18**  In the fifth
passion, the body begins to turn on the bed of flowers. In the sixth passion, he
begins to regard various kinds of delicious food as if they were poison.  **99**
In the seventh, being absorbed in conversations regarding the beloved, he
engages in nonsensical talk. In the eighth, madness manifests, causing him to
sing and dance.  **100**  In the ninth passion, this wind-born becomes faint due
to the serpent of desire, and in the tenth, he begins to feel the weight of
suffering that is experienced by oneself.  **101**  Gautama says that although
this wind-born was endowed with discernment, at that moment, his character
became indulgent; thus, he deserves to be condemned for such wicked desire.
**341**  From the aforementioned passions, the patience of the wind-born broke
down. His face became restless due to the continuous exhalation, and he began to
cover it with his palms.  **102**  He constantly kept his cheeks, filled with
sweat, in his palms, which increased their redness. In the pursuit of coolness,
he would sit on the leafy seats while dampening them with long, hot exhalations.
**103**  Enduring unbearable passions caused by deep strikes of arrows, this
wind-born frequently yawned, trembled again and again, and stretched repeatedly.
**104**  By constantly focusing on the woman, his sense faculties became futile,
meaning none of his senses acted properly, and he could find no patience even in
the best of places—he remained restless.  **105**  He became empty-hearted,
having abandoned all actions. For a moment, he might have held onto shame but
then quickly discarded it.  **106**  All of his limbs weakened, and he abandoned
all embellishments.  ---  The translation above incorporates the Sanskrit
phrases and maintains the original structure and meaning as accurately as
possible while translating to English.

342 Padma Purana I When will I see my beloved seated in my lap, touching her
lotus-like body and engaging in conversation? || 108 || Hearing this, my state
has become so painful. What will happen when I see her in person? I will surely
die. || 109 || Oh, what a wonder! My dear friend, though beautiful, is the cause
of my suffering. || 110 || Oh, good woman, why are you ready to burn the very
heart where you reside with the fire of sorrow? || 111 || Women are naturally
soft-hearted, but this seems contrary in your case, as you are causing me pain.
|| 112 || Oh, Cupid, even without a body, you cause me so much pain. If you had
a body, it would be even more unbearable. || 113 || Though there is no wound on
my body, the pain is immense. I am constantly moving around, even though I am
sitting in one place. || 114 || These three days will not pass peacefully for me
if I do not make her the object of my sight. || 115 || Therefore, what means can
I find to see her, by which my mind will attain peace? || 116 || Or, in all the
tasks to be done in this world, there is no other cause to be seen except my
best friend. || 117 || Thinking thus, Pavananjay spoke to his friend Prahasit,
who was sitting beside him like a shadow, as if another body born from his own
actions, and who was a confidant in all matters. || 118-119 || He said, "Friend,
you know my intentions, so what can I say? My words will only cause you pain."
|| 120 || Oh, friend, to whom can I express this sorrow, having abandoned you,
who has witnessed all the activities of the three worlds? || 121 || Pavananjay
was constantly thinking about the woman, and his family was very worried about
his condition. || 107 || He used to think, "When will I see my beloved seated in
my lap, touching her lotus-like body and engaging in conversation?" || 108 ||
"Hearing this, my state has become so painful. What will happen when I see her
in person? I will surely die." || 109 || "Oh, what a wonder! My dear friend,
though beautiful, is the cause of my suffering." || 110 || "Oh, good woman, why
are you ready to burn the very heart where you reside with the fire of sorrow?"
|| 111 || "Women are naturally soft-hearted, but this seems contrary in your

you cause me so much pain. If you had a body, it would be even more unbearable."
|| 113 || "Though there is no wound on my body, the pain is immense. I am
constantly moving around, even though I am sitting in one place." || 114 ||
"These three days will not pass peacefully for me if I do not make her the

"Oh, friend, to whom can I express this sorrow, having abandoned you, who has
witnessed all the activities of the three worlds?" || 121 || 1. Touching lotus-
like body. 2. I will not see, I will die. 3. Residence is made. 4. In whom you
are pleased. 5. Burn. 6. You are capable. 7. It is not done here. 8. You wander.

"Fifteen, the family member, is dear to the king as a student is to his teacher.
A wife is dear to her husband, a patient to his physician, a child to his
mother. In the same way, a wise man is dear to his friend. Therefore, I tell you
this.  Since I heard about the flawless beauty, the daughter of King Mahendra, I
have been overwhelmed by the arrows of Kamadeva.  I cannot bear to spend even
three days without seeing that beautiful Priya, who steals my heart.  Therefore,
make an effort so that I can see her. For by seeing her, I will be healthy, and
by my being healthy, you will also be healthy.  Indeed, life is the most desired
thing for all beings, for it is only with life that other things are possible.
Thus, the friend, laughing and joking, as if his heart was fulfilled, quickly
said:  "My friend, what is the point of saying much when the time for action has
passed? Tell me, what should I be done? There is no difference between us.  As
long as this conversation continues between these two good-hearted friends, the
sun has set, as if to do them a favor.  The sun, which was red like the passion
of Prahlada, desired the spread of darkness and was a lover of good deeds, was
driven by the light of the evening.  Seeing the sorrow of the sun, who was
without his beloved, the evening, filled with compassion, followed her husband,
the sun.  Then, the east, as if it had lost its husband, the sun, became dark,
as if it had been stained by the darkness.  The world seemed to be covered in a
blue cloth, or as if the dense pollen of blue collyrium was falling everywhere."

In the Pāpurāṇa, when the appropriate time for the natural task arrived,
Pavanajaya, filled with enthusiasm, said to his friend as follows:   "Oh friend!
Arise, show the way, let us go to that place where the heart-stealer resides."
After saying this, both friends set out for that location. Their minds had
already started the journey even before their bodies did, moving like fish in
the vast sea resembling the blue sky.   In a moment, they reached the house of
Aṅjanā-sundarī. That house was adorned as magnificently as Mount Sumeru,
embellished by the presence of Aṅjanā-sundarī.   Climbing the seventh
compartment of the building, the two friends concealed themselves behind a
lattice of pearls and began to observe Aṅjanā-sundarī from there.   Aṅjanā-
sundarī was rendering the lamps burning within the house fruitless by the rays
of her full moon-like face, and the colors of the directions were being painted
by the light of her white, black, and red eyes.   She had majestic, elevated,
and beautiful breasts which made it seem as if she was holding two pots filled
with the essence of love, awaiting her husband’s arrival.   Her hands and feet,
adorned with a red radiance reminiscent of new buds and filled with many
auspicious signs, appeared as if they were exuding beauty through beams like
nails.   Her waist was narrow, yet the heavy weight of her breasts rested upon
it, leading her to bind herself tightly with ropes resembling three folds, lest
she break under the burden.   Aṅjanā, with her round thighs, resembled the
quiver of Kamadeva, or the pillars binding intoxication and desire, or rivers
that pour forth beauty.   Her radiance was akin to a cluster of blue lotuses,
adorned with stars resembling pearls, and with the moon-like husband nearby, she
appeared like the embodiment of night.   Thus, gazing at Aṅjanā who could never
satiate the beholder, Pavanajaya attained supreme bliss with his unwavering
eyes.

The Five Vows Festival  Meanwhile, her dearest friend, Vasantatilaka, spoke to
Anjana Sundari, saying, "Oh beautiful princess, you are most fortunate! Your
father has given you to the mighty Pavananjay."  "The entire world is filled
with his virtues, pure as the rays of the moon, and he disregards the fame of
other men's qualities."  "It is a joyous occasion that you, adorned with the
brilliance of great jewels, will sit in his lap, like the tide in the ocean,
making a beautiful sound."  "Your connection with him will be like a stream of
jewels flowing on the banks of a mountain of jewels. Indeed, the joy arising
from a praiseworthy relationship is the greatest joy for women."  As her friend
Vasantmala was describing Pavananjay's virtues, Anjana was happy in her heart
and, out of shyness, lowered her head and scratched her toe with her finger.
Pavananjay, whose eyes were filled with blooming lotuses, was carried away by
the current of joy, far, far away.  Then another friend, Mishrakeśī, spoke, her
red lips drawn inwards, and the flower in her braid fell down as she shook her
head.  "Oh, you have revealed your great ignorance by choosing Pavananjay over
Vidutprabha!"  "I have heard many times in the royal palaces that this girl
should be given to Vidutprabha, or not.  "Only he who knows the number of drops
in the ocean can understand the depth of his pure qualities."  "He is young,
gentle, humble, radiant, wise, brave, powerful, a master of knowledge, and the
whole world desires to see him."  "If, by good fortune, Vidutprabha were to
become this girl's husband, then she would receive the fruit of this birth."  "O
Vasantamalika, the difference between Pavananjay and Vidutprabha is known in the
world, just as the difference between a cow and an ocean is known."

346 In the Padma Purana, it is said that he will attain the status of a Muni in
a few years. His father abandoned him, which does not seem right to me.  ||16||
Even a moment spent with Vidhyut Prabha is a source of happiness, while an
eternity spent with a lowly creature is not. ||162||  Upon hearing this,
Prahlaadi, inflamed by the fire of anger, trembled and his complexion changed in
an instant. ||163||  He bit his lip, drew his sword from its sheath, and his
eyes, filled with a crimson glow, enveloped the entire horizon. ||164||  He said
to his friend, "Oh, Prahasita! This must be what this girl desires, for this
woman is speaking such vile things in her presence." ||165||  "Therefore, watch
as I sever the heads of both of them. May Vidhyut Prabha, the beloved of my
heart, protect them now." ||166||  Hearing these words, Prahasita, whose
forehead was furrowed with anger, replied, "Friend, friend, stop this pointless
effort, it is not your place. Your sword is meant for destroying enemies, not
women." ||167-168||  "Therefore, see how I will silence this wicked woman with
this rod and make her lifeless." ||169||  Seeing Prahasita's immense rage,
Pavananjay forgot his own anger, sheathed his sword, ||170||  and his entire
body became attuned to its natural state, meaning his anger subsided. Then he
spoke to his friend, who was determined to commit a cruel act. ||171||  "My
friend, calm down. These women are not worthy of your anger, you who are adorned
with victories in countless battles." ||172||  "It is not right for anyone to
kill women, let alone for you, who can cleave the skulls of maddened elephants.

## Chapter Fifteen  Surely, this lightning-bright one must be dear to this girl,
for he did not even rebuke her, who was so engrossed in slandering me. ||176||
Then, without anyone knowing, the two friends, who had arrived, went out of the
window and returned to their own camp. ||177||  Then, with a heart full of
peace, Pavana-jaya, who had attained supreme dispassion, began to think: ||178||
One should avoid from afar the river of a woman attached to another man, which
is filled with whirlpools of doubt and crocodiles of evil intentions. ||179||
This woman, who is extremely dense with bad intentions and filled with a swarm
of sensual desires, is like a vast forest; the wise should never serve her.
||180||  What is the benefit of serving a king who associates with his enemies?
Similarly, how can one find happiness with a weak friend and a woman attached to
another man? ||181||  Wise men abandon their beloved friends, relatives, sons,
and wives when they are disrespected, but those who are petty perish by drowning
in the water of defeat. ||182||  A physician who is addicted to alcohol, an
elephant without training, an enemy without cause, a cruel person who follows a
violent religion, a group of fools, a country without morals, a cruel king, a
child, and a woman attached to another man - a wise man should avoid all of
these from afar. ||183-184||  Thinking thus, Pavana-jaya's night, like the night
of the girl's invitation, came to an end, and the instruments that awaken the
world began to play. ||185||  Then, the eastern direction was covered with the
redness of the evening, as if it were continuously covered by the dispassion
abandoned by Pavana-jaya. ||186||  And the sun, which appeared red due to anger,
rose, holding a trembling orb, the cause of the world's activities. ||187||
Then, Pavana-jaya, who was completely indifferent to women, holding a body made
sluggish by dispassion, spoke to his laughing friend: ||188||  "Friend, even if
I am near her, it is not appropriate for me to stay here. Therefore, listen, let
there be no contact with the wind that is attached to her." ||189||

348 In the Padma Purana, "Rise, let us go to our city, it is not right to linger
here. Let the army be alerted by the sound of the conch shell that signals
departure." ||190||  Upon hearing this, the army, which was like a churning sea,
stirred and quickly prepared for departure, having completed all the necessary
tasks. ||191|| Then, a great sound arose from the chariots, horses, elephants,
and foot soldiers, along with the sound of the conch and other instruments, and
it reached the girl's ears. ||192||  The sound, which signaled departure, filled
her with immense sorrow, as if she were pierced by a nail driven in with the
force of a hammer blow. ||193|| She thought, "Alas, what a misfortune! Fate has
given me a treasure and then taken it away. What shall I do? How will this turn
out?" ||194||  The desires I had, to play in the lap of this great man, have all
been turned upside down, my hopes dashed. ||195||  Knowing that this is
happening, somehow this enemy, my friend, has come to hate me. ||196||  Curse
this friendless, sinful, cruel-tongued woman, who has brought this state upon my
beloved. ||197||  My father, if he could bring my beloved back, would do me a
great favor. Perhaps he could even bring him back to his senses. ||198||  If my
beloved truly abandons me, I will give up food and die. ||199||  Thinking this,
she fainted and fell to the ground like a vine uprooted from its roots. ||200||
Then, saying, "What is this?" and overcome with anxiety, her two friends revived
her with cold water. ||201||  They asked her, with great effort, the reason for
her fainting, but she, with her limbs slack and eyes fixed, could not speak a
word. ||202||  Then, the people in the army of Vayu Kumar (Pavananjay) were
bewildered by this unexpected departure and anxiously wondered why he was
leaving without completing his desired task. ||203||  "Listen, and rise! Let us
go to our city, it is not right to linger here. Let the army be alerted by the
sound of the conch shell that signals departure." ||189-190||

## The Fifteenth Chapter  349  Why is he eager to go? What has caused his anger?
Or who has instigated him otherwise? ||20||  He has all the preparations for
taking the girl, so why has he become indifferent? ||205||  Some laughed and
said, "His name 'Pavananjay' is indeed meaningful, since he has conquered the
wind with his speed." ||206||  Others said, "He still doesn't know the essence
of a woman. That's why he's eager to leave this girl." ||207||  "If he knew the
joy of true love, he would be bound by its ties, like a wild elephant." ||208||
Thus, surrounded by hundreds of courtiers engaged in private conversations,
Pavananjay, mounted on his swift chariot, was ready to depart. ||209||  Then,
the girl's father, learning of his departure, came there in a state of panic,
accompanied by all his relatives. ||210||  He, along with Prahlad, said to the
prince, "O noble one, why are you undertaking this journey, which is the cause
of sorrow? What has someone said to you? O noble man, who is not dear to you? O
wise one, no one even considers what is not pleasing to you." ||211-212||  "Even
if there are faults, it is right for you to heed my words and your father's. And
this act is free from all faults, so how can it be wrong?" ||213||  "Therefore,
O wise one, return and fulfill our desires. For men like you, a father's command
should be a cause of joy." ||214||  Saying this, the father-in-law and father,
moved by love for their son, respectfully took the hand of the bowed hero,
Pavananjay. ||215||  Then, unable to bear the weight of their respect,
Pavananjay turned back and began to ponder the reasons for the anger and sorrow
that caused him to inflict pain on the girl. ||216||  Now, I will marry this
girl, and through this union, I will experience the sorrow born of non-
attachment. This way, she will not find happiness with any other man. ||217||

350 The Padmapurana states that the friend understood the meaning and spoke
accordingly. This was also understood by the wise Pavananjay. ||21|| Hearing
that her beloved had returned, the girl was overjoyed. Her entire body trembled
with excitement. ||219|| Then, when the time was right, the relatives performed
the auspicious marriage ceremony of the two, fulfilling everyone's desires.
||220|| Although the girl's hand was as cool as the touch of an Ashoka leaf, it
felt like a burning ember to the detached Pavananjay. ||221||  His gaze fell
upon Anjana's body, who was like lightning, involuntarily, but he could not stay
there even for a moment. ||222|| Knowing that Pavananjay did not understand the
girl's feelings, Agni, as if in the guise of a crackling spark, laughed with a
sound. ||223|| Then, with the proper rituals, the marriage of the two was
performed, and all the relatives were filled with joy and made sounds of
celebration. ||224|| In that forest, adorned with various trees and vines, and
blooming with fruits and flowers, they celebrated with great splendor for a
month. ||225|| After exchanging greetings and offering appropriate respects to
each other, they all went their separate ways, feeling a moment of sadness due
to separation. ||226|| The Aryachhandas says: Those who do not know the true
nature of things, perform sacrifices for others, but they are ashamed. The root
cause of this is the sun of karma, which brings suffering. ||227|| Thus ends the
fifteenth chapter of the Padmapurana, known as the Anjanasundari Vivah, narrated
by the sage Ravishena, as told by the Acharya. ||15|| 1.  "Teneti" is spoken by
M. 2.  "Prarabdham" is the reading in M., J., and "Praduhtam" is the reading in
M., J. 3.  "Praaptam sarvasamihitam" is the reading in Kh. 4.  "Vidyuti" is the
reading in K., Kh., J., and M.

## The Sixteenth Chapter  Then, due to the lack of conversation and even a
glance from him, she experienced immense sorrow, her mind unaware of the reason.
||1|| Even at night, she couldn't find sleep, her eyes wide open, her breasts
constantly stained with tears. ||2|| She even greeted the wind, bearing the same
name as her beloved, her ears eagerly listening for his name. ||3|| She kept his
image, as she had seen him at the altar, in her mind, becoming motionless for
moments, her eyes fixed. ||4|| Wishing to see him outside, she would wipe her
eyes, but when she couldn't see him, she would again be filled with sorrow.
||5|| Having seen his form only once, she struggled to draw his image, her hand
trembling, causing the pen to fall. ||6|| She moved her face with difficulty,
her body so frail that her ornaments fell loose, making a clinking sound. ||7||
Her long, hot breaths burned her hands and cheeks, and even the weight of her
thin garment caused her discomfort. ||8|| She severely criticized herself,
constantly remembering her parents, her heart empty, becoming motionless for
moments. ||9|| With her throat choked with tears, she would lament her fate, her
words filled with sorrow. ||10|| She felt a burning sensation even from the rays
of the moon, and even within the palace, she would faint repeatedly. ||11||

Here is the English translation, preserving the Jain terms:  352 In the Padma
Purana, [the devotee says]: "O Lord, how are your limbs so enchanting to me? The
places in my heart where your limbs reside cause me the utmost anguish." (12)
"Surely, no offense has been committed by me, O Lord. Without any reason, why
have you become so angry with me?" (13) "Be gracious, I am your devotee, relieve
my mind's distress. This folded palms offering has been made to you." (14) "Just
as the sky without the sun, or the night without the moon, I do not shine
without you, bereft of virtues as well." (15) "Reproaching the one residing in
the mind, she sheds large pearls from her eyes." (16) "Even though present on
the delicate flower-beds, by the command of the guru, she maintains her
composure." (17) "Bearing her own whirling like a chakra, wandering due to lack
of samskara, her matted hair." (18) "She appears fiery from the heat of anguish,
watery from the continuous flow of tears, empty like the sky, and motionless
like the earth." (19) "Formed by the continuous flow of vayus, she resembles the
element of air. Devoid of consciousness, she is like the four elements." (20)
"Able to sit on the ground, but unable to rise up, having placed her hands on
the shoulders of her companions." (22) "She envies the clever women who are
always with their beloved, her unmoving eyes fixed on them." (23) "Having
endured the insult of her beloved, without any reason, she passed days of great
difficulty, like years." (24)

## Sixteen Chapters  353. In this state, her entire family was equally
distressed, or even more so, and they were constantly troubled by the question
of what to do. ||25|| They pondered whether this had happened without any
reason, or if it was the result of ripened karma accumulated from past lives.
||26|| Or perhaps it was the consequence of some obstructing karma acquired in a
previous birth, now ready to bear fruit, the result of Vayu Kumar's actions in
the past. ||27|| As a result, he, along with this innocent and virtuous woman,
is unable to enjoy the supreme pleasures that bring happiness to all the senses.
||28|| Listen, Anjana, who had never experienced even a moment of sorrow in her
father's house, is now burdened with this suffering due to the influence of her
karma. ||29|| What remedy can we, who are devoid of fortune, find in this
situation? This is a matter of karma, beyond our reach, beyond our efforts.
||30|| It would be good if this princess, through the merit we have accumulated,
becomes the object of her husband's love. ||31|| Or perhaps we have no merit,
not even a speck, and we are submerged in this vast ocean of sorrow, caused by
this child. ||32|| When will that auspicious moment arrive when her beloved
husband will hold her in his arms and engage in playful conversation with this
child? ||33||  Meanwhile, a conflict arose between Varuna, who possessed immense
pride and strength, and the powerful Rakshasa, Ravana. ||34|| Ravana sent a
messenger to Varuna, who, radiating the supreme brilliance of his master,
addressed Varuna, saying: ||35|| "O Varuna, the glorious lord of the
Vidyadharas, Ravana, commands you to either pay your respects to me or prepare
for battle." ||36|| Varuna, with his naturally steady mind, laughed and said,
"Messenger, who is this Ravana, and what does he do?" ||37|| "I am not Indra,
nor the powerful Vaishravana, nor Sahasrarashmi, nor the Maruts, nor Yama."
||38|| "This one, adorned with jewels bestowed by the gods, is indeed worthy of
respect. Let him come, and I will show him what it means to be rendered
speechless." ||39||

354 "Surely, your death is imminent, that's why you speak so clearly," said the
messenger. Having said this, he went to Ravana and delivered the message. ||40||
Then, filled with extreme anger, Ravana surrounded the city of Varuna with his
army, which was as vast as the ocean. ||41|| He made a vow, "I will defeat this
fickle one without the divine gems, or I will face death." ||42|| Rajiva,
Paundarika, and the other sons of Varuna were enraged upon hearing of the
enemy's arrival. They came out, fully armed, ready for battle. ||43|| Then, a
fierce battle ensued between Ravana's army and theirs. The various weapons
clashed and shattered, falling to the ground. ||44|| Elephants fought elephants,
horses fought horses, chariots fought chariots, and soldiers fought soldiers.
The warriors roared, their lips were bitten, and their eyes were red with anger.
||45|| Then, the army of Varuna, which had fought for a long time and had been
wounded by the enemy's weapons, turned back. ||46|| Then, Varuna, who was as
fierce as the fire of destruction and was moving amidst the cage of weapons,
rushed towards the army of demons. ||47|| Seeing Varuna approaching the
battlefield with unstoppable speed, Ravana's army, armed with blazing weapons,
protected him. ||48|| Then, reassured by Varuna, his sons again engaged in
fierce battle, destroying the army of demons and elephants. ||49|| Then, Ravana,
whose mind was burning with anger and whose forehead was furrowed, took up his
bow. ||50|| While Ravana was preparing for battle, Khara and Dushana, who had
been fighting for a long time without any weariness, were captured by a hundred
of Varuna's sons. ||51|| Then, Ravana's mind became extremely troubled. He
thought, "How can we be victorious in this battle?" ||52||

## Sixteen Chapters ### 355  It would not be fitting for me to harbor thoughts
of war at this time. ||52|| If the great battle continues, there is a chance of
Kharadushana's death, therefore it is appropriate to maintain peace now. ||53||
Having decided this, Ravana moved away from the forefront of the battle. For the
noble do not abandon their sense of duty, nor do they lose their taste for what
is right. ||54|| Then, after consulting with his ministers, who were skilled in
matters of counsel, he summoned all his vassals, who were stationed in their
respective territories, along with their entire armies. He sent messengers
quickly, those who had traveled long distances and wore letters on their
foreheads. ||55-56|| A man sent by Ravana also arrived at Prahlada's place. He,
out of devotion to his master, treated him with due respect. ||57|| He asked, "O
Bhadra! Is the lord of the Vidyadharas, Ravana, well?" Then, saying "He is
well," with respect, he placed Ravana's letter before Prahlada. ||58|| After
that, Prahlada, in a moment of excitement, took the letter himself, placed it on
his head, and then had it read aloud, conveying its meaning. ||59|| The letter
read: "Greetings! To the king Prahlada, who resides in the city of Aditya Nagar,
the righteous judge, the knower of the laws of time and place, and devoted to
our love. Ravana, the lord of the Vidyadhara kings, who is stationed near the
city of Alankarpur, who is prosperous, the son of Sumali, the moon of the
celestial sphere of the Rakshasa lineage, informs you, after inquiring about
your well-being, that all the Vidyadhara kings, whose hair has turned yellow due
to the radiance of their fingernails, have already come and paid their respects
to me. But Varuna, who resides in the city of Patala, being endowed with his own
power, is opposing me. He is surrounded by a group of Vidyadharas who inflict
pain on the heart, and he lives happily in the middle of the ocean. Due to this
animosity, a fierce battle took place, and Kharadushana was captured by his
hundred sons." ||60-66||

"In the Padma Purana, there was doubt in the battle, 'He might perish,' so it
was decided. The great battle was abandoned, knowing the time was right. [67]
Therefore, you must come here to counter this, for men like you never falter in
their duty. [68] Having decided this with you, we will act accordingly now. Even
the sun performs its duty in conjunction with Arun. [69]  Then, having conveyed
the essence of the letter to Vayu, and having consulted with the wise ministers,
Prahlad decided to depart without delay. [70] Seeing his father ready to depart,
Vayu, kneeling on the ground and joining his hands in salutation, said: [71] "O
Lord, it is not right for you to leave while I am here. Fathers embrace their
sons, and sons must surely repay the fruit of that embrace. [72] If I do not
repay that fruit, I cannot be called a son. Therefore, please be pleased with me
by granting me permission to depart." [73]  Then his father said to him, "You
are still a child, you have not experienced the sorrow of battle, so stay here
happily, I will go." [74]  Then, with his chest as broad as the shore of Mount
Meru, Vayu spoke the following powerful words: [75] "Father, the first sign of
my strength is that I was born of you. Or, is the spark of fire ever tested to
see if it can burn the world?" [76] "My head, purified by the offering of your
command, is capable of defeating even Indra, there is no doubt about it." [77]
Having said this, he saluted his father, and then, filled with joy, he rose and
performed his ablutions, meals, and other bodily functions. [78]  Then, the
elders of the family, with great respect, blessed him, and he, adorned with
auspiciousness, bowed to the Siddhas with reverence, radiating supreme
brilliance. [79]"

The Sixteenth Chapter 357 With eyes filled with tears, and fearing the
destruction of auspiciousness, he was kissed by his parents who were showering
blessings. ||8|| He asked after all his relatives, greeted them all with a
smile, and, bowing down, honored his devoted followers in their entirety. ||8||
By nature, he raised his right foot first. His right arm kept twitching with
joy. ||82|| His eyes fell upon a full pitcher with leaves on its mouth, as he
was leaving the palace. He suddenly saw Anjana. ||83|| Anjana was standing
leaning against the doorpost, her eyes filled with tears. She was supporting her
waist with her arm, but due to weakness, her arm kept slipping down. ||84|| Her
lips were very pale, devoid of the redness of betel nut, and she looked like a
dirty doll carved into the very pillar. ||85||  Then, just as a man quickly
averts his gaze from lightning, Pavananjay quickly averted his gaze from Anjana.
He was angry and said, ||86|| "O you who look far away! Quickly leave this
place. I am not capable of looking at you, like a meteor." ||87|| "Oh, what
great audacity you have, being a woman of noble lineage, to stand in front of me
even when I don't want you to. You are very shameless." ||88|| Although
Pavananjay's words were very harsh, Anjana, being devoted to her husband,
listened to them with great attention, just as a thirsty man drinks water that
he has received after a long time. ||89|| With her eyes fixed on her husband's
feet, and her hands folded, she said. Although she tried to speak clearly, she
kept stumbling, becoming silent, or saying something else altogether. ||90|| She
said, "O Lord! Even though I am living in this palace, I am abandoned by you.
Still, I have been living with great difficulty, finding satisfaction in the
mere fact that I am near you." ||91|| "But O Lord! Now that you are going far
away, how will I, who am constantly in sorrow, live without the taste of your
nectar-like words?" ||92|| "O Lord! While going to a foreign land, you have
spoken to your servants with affection, even though they are not deserving.
||93||  Salute the supreme Siddha, Pavananjay, with devotion. After bidding
farewell to all your relatives, greet your elder brothers, and converse with all
your followers with devotion, smiling gently, and leave the house. ||79-81|| By
nature, he raised his right foot first. His right arm kept twitching with joy.
||82|| And his eyes fell upon a full pitcher with leaves on its mouth, as he was
leaving the palace. He suddenly saw Anjana. ||83|| Anjana was standing leaning
against the doorpost, her eyes filled with tears. She was supporting her waist
with her arm, but due to weakness, her arm kept slipping down. ||84|| Her lips
were very pale, devoid of the redness of betel nut, and she looked like a dirty
doll carved into the very pillar. ||85||  Then, just as a man quickly averts his
gaze from lightning, Pavananjay quickly averted his gaze from Anjana. He was
angry and said, ||86|| "O you who look far away! Quickly leave this place. I am
not capable of looking at you, like a meteor." ||87|| "Oh, what great audacity
you have, being a woman of noble lineage, to stand in front of me even when I
don't want you to. You are very shameless." ||88|| Although Pavananjay's words
were very harsh, Anjana, being devoted to her husband, listened to them with
great attention, just as a thirsty man drinks water that he has received after a
long time. ||89|| With her eyes fixed on her husband's feet, and her hands
folded, she said. Although she tried to speak clearly, she kept stumbling,
becoming silent, or saying something else altogether. ||90|| She said, "O Lord!
Even though I am living in this palace, I am abandoned by you. Still, I have
been living with great difficulty, finding satisfaction in the mere fact that I
am near you." ||91|| "But O Lord! Now that you are going far away, how will I,
who am constantly in sorrow, live without the taste of your nectar-like words?"
||92|| "O Lord! While going to a foreign land, you have spoken to your servants
with affection, even though they are not deserving. ||93||

358 In the Padma Purana, I, with my heart solely devoted to you, am tormented by
the pain of separation from you. How is it that you have not spoken to me, even
through another's mouth, O Lord? ||9|| You have abandoned me, my Lord, and in
this entire world, there is no other refuge for me, or else death would be my
refuge. ||15|| Then, with a constricted face, she said, "Die," and, overcome
with grief, she fell to the ground. ||16|| The wind, bearing the highest
prosperity, and devoid of compassion, mounted a magnificent elephant and, along
with his vassals, set out. ||17|| On the first day, he reached the Manasarovar
Lake. Though his vehicles were not weary, he stationed his army on the bank of
the lake. ||18|| As his army descended from the sky, it shone brightly, adorned
with various vehicles and weapons, like a group of gods. ||19|| The
Vidyaadharas, filled with joy, performed all the necessary tasks, such as
bathing, eating, etc., for themselves and their vehicles. ||100|| Then, by the
power of knowledge, a beautiful palace was quickly constructed, with many
sections, and with appropriate length, breadth, and height. On the upper section
of the palace, Pavananjay, seated on a magnificent throne, was engaged in
conversation with his friend, his joy increasing with tales of war. ||101-102||
Pavananjay, through the windows, was looking at the trees on the bank and the
Manasarovar Lake, gently swaying in the soft breeze. ||103|| In the lake,
fearsome turtles, fish, crocodiles, proud alligators, and many other aquatic
creatures were creating waves. ||104|| The water of the lake, clear like
polished crystal, adorned with lotuses and blue lotuses, was further beautified
by swans, cranes, herons, and sarasa birds. ||105|| The deep sound of all these
birds was captivating both the mind and the ears. And within that sound, the
buzzing of bees could be heard. ||106|| Servant people have spoken to you, yet
my mind is fixed only on you, and I am constantly pained by your separation. Why
have you not spoken to me, even through another's mouth? ||93-94|| O Lord! You
have abandoned me, and in this entire world, there is no other refuge for me, or
else death would be my refuge. ||25|| Then, Pavananjay, with a constricted face,
said, "Die." As soon as he said that, she, overcome with grief, fell to the
ground. ||96|| Meanwhile, Pavananjay, bearing the highest prosperity, mounted a
magnificent elephant and, along with his vassals, set out. ||97|| On the first
day, he reached the Manasarovar Lake. Though his vehicles were not weary, he

On the shore of the lake, Pavanjaya saw a Cakavi. She was alone and deeply
distressed, consumed by the fire of separation. She was making various efforts,
her eyes fixed on the setting sun, repeatedly looking into the holes in the
lotus leaves. She was flapping her wings with speed, flying up and down,
distressed. She was looking at the sweet water with pieces of Mrinala,
sorrowful. Seeing her reflection in the water, she called out to her beloved,
and when he did not come, she was overcome with grief. Hearing the echoes from
various places, she hoped that her beloved was calling out, and she circled
around like a wheel, her eyes beautiful. She climbed onto a tree on the shore
and looked in all directions. When she did not see her beloved there, she
descended with great speed. She was scattering the pollen of the lotuses far and
wide with the flapping of her wings. Pavanjaya, moved by compassion, saw her
sorrowful state and watched her for a long time.  He thought to himself, "This
is a great sorrow that has befallen her. Separated from her beloved, she is
burning with the fire of grief." This beautiful lake, cool like the moon and
sandalwood, has become like a blazing fire for her, having been separated from
her beloved. For a woman separated from her beloved, even a leaf becomes a
sword, the rays of the moon become a thunderbolt, and heaven itself becomes
hell.  Thinking thus, his mind went to his beloved Anjanasundari. Filled with
love, he looked at the places he had served during their marriage. Those places,
now before his eyes, became unbearable sources of sorrow, like those who pierce
the heart. He thought to himself, "Alas, what a terrible thing! She, abandoned
by me, a wicked-minded man, is suffering like this Cakavi." If his friend had
spoken harsh words to her at that time, why did I abandon her because of the
fault of another?

360 Alas, for fools like me who act without considering the consequences,
bringing suffering upon people without reason. ||12|| My heart, a sinner's
heart, is truly made of iron, for it has remained so long against my beloved.
||122|| What should I do now, father? I left home after asking him. How can I
return now? Alas, I have fallen into great trouble. ||123|| If I go to war, she
will surely not survive, and in her absence, I too will be lost. There is no
greater suffering than this. ||124|| Or perhaps my supreme friend, the one who
unravels all knots of doubt, exists. He is the judge of this auspicious task.
||125|| Therefore, I ask this friend, skilled in all matters, for those who act
with deliberation find happiness, not those who act without it. ||126|| While
Pavananjay was contemplating this, his cheerful friend saw him distracted.
Grieving over his sorrow, he softly asked, ||127|| "My friend, you have set out
to destroy your enemy, why then does your face appear so gloomy today?" ||128||
"O virtuous one, cast aside your shame and quickly tell me the reason. Your
sadness fills me with great anxiety." ||129|| Then Pavananjay, his courage
shattered, spoke with difficulty, having gone far astray. ||130|| "O beautiful
one, listen, to whom else can I speak? You are truly the recipient of all my
secrets." ||131|| "My friend, this is not something you should tell anyone else,
for it brings me great shame." ||132|| In response, the cheerful one said,
"Speak without fear, for what you say is like water on hot iron to me." ||133||
Then Pavananjay said, "My friend, listen, I have never loved Anjana. ||134||

## Sixteen Chapters  Even though I am cruel and did not speak to her due to my
cruelty, she kept herself alive by constantly shedding tears due to my
proximity. ||135||  When I arrived, I saw her condition, and I know now that she
will not survive this separation. ||136||  Without any fault of hers, I have
disregarded her for twenty-two years, being like a stone in my heart. ||137||
When I arrived, I saw her face, devoid of the beauty that had been lost due to
the contact of sorrow. ||138||  When her long, blue lotus-like eyes come to my
memory, my heart is pierced like an arrow. ||139||  Therefore, O virtuous one,
find a way so that we can meet, and death may not befall either of us. ||140||
Then, the one whose body was still but whose mind was like a restless swing in
the contemplation of a solution, spoke with a smile, saying: ||141||  Since you
have left after consulting the gurus and wish to conquer the enemy, it is not
appropriate for you to return now. ||142||  Moreover, you have never brought
Anjana to the gurus before, so bringing her here now would be shameful. ||143||
Therefore, it is best that you go secretly and make her worthy of your sight and
the pleasure of conversation. ||144||  Your meeting is the support of her life,
so grant her this for a long time, and then return quickly, having calmed your
mind. ||145||  Then, being free from worry and carrying the best enthusiasm, you
will be able to go and conquer the enemy. This is a sure way. ||146||  Then,
saying "Very well," the swift Pavananjay, appointed Mudgara, the commander, to
protect the army, and taking garlands, ointments, and other fragrant substances,
he went up into the sky, taking the smiling friend with him, under the pretext
of worshipping Meru. ||147-148||  Meanwhile, the sun was setting, as if urged by
compassion, so that the union of these two might take place in the night.

362 In the Padma Purana, it is said, "Due to the destruction of the twilight
glow, the world is enveloped in darkness, and all objects can only be known by
touch." (150) Pavananjay arrived at the house of Anjanasundari and stayed in the
outer courtyard, while Prahasita went inside. (151) Seeing him suddenly in the
dim light of the lamp, Anjanasundari was terrified and exclaimed, "Who is this?
Who is this?" (152) She woke up her sleeping friend, Vasantmala, and the clever
woman, upon waking, calmed her fears. (153) Then, Prahasita, saying, "I am
Prahasita," bowed and informed her of Pavananjay's arrival. (154) Hearing this
news, which was like a dream, of her beloved's arrival, she spoke to Prahasita
in a choked voice, filled with humility, saying: (155) "Oh Prahasita, why do you
laugh at me, who am devoid of merit and abandoned by my beloved? I am myself the
object of ridicule due to my own impure actions." (156) "Knowing that I am
rejected by my beloved, who has not scorned me, the unfortunate and sorrowful
one? (157) "Especially you, with your wicked mind, have encouraged my beloved
and brought me to this state of extreme suffering." (158) "Or perhaps, O noble
one, what fault is yours? For the whole world, under the influence of karma,
experiences both sorrow and happiness." (159) Thus, Anjanasundari, shedding
tears and intent on self-reproach, was addressed by Prahasita, whose heart was
filled with sorrow. (160) He said, "O auspicious one, do not speak thus. Forgive
me, for I am a foolish and sinful being." (161) "Your evil deeds have surely
been destroyed now, for your beloved, drawn by the virtue of love, has come
himself." (162) "Now that he is pleased, what is there that will not bring you
happiness? Indeed, what beauty is there in the night when the moon unites with
the stars?" (163) 1. Sandhyam. 2. Tapasānvitām. 3. Pragrīvo. 4. Prasannēti.

## Chapter Sixteen  Then, after a moment of silence, Anjanasundari spoke, her
words echoing the sentiments expressed by her friend.  || 164 ||  "My dear, it
is impossible for a year to be without rain, just as it is impossible for them
to come. Or perhaps, this is a time when some auspicious deed of mine has borne
fruit, making their arrival possible." || 165 ||  "Very well, if my lord has
come, I welcome him. The tree of my past good deeds has finally borne fruit
today." || 166 ||  As she spoke, her eyes filled with tears of joy, and her
friend, with the same compassion, brought her beloved to her side. || 167 ||
Seeing her beloved, Anjanasundari, whose eyes were as beautiful as those of a
frightened deer, was overcome with joy. She tried to rise from her bed, but her
legs trembled, and she kept placing her hands on her knees, only to have them
slip down again. Her thighs were stiff as pillars, and her whole body shook. ||
168 - 169 ||  Seeing this, Pavananjay, with a voice like nectar, said, "My dear,
let it be. What is the point of this agitation, which only brings distress?" ||
170 ||  Despite his words, Anjanasundari struggled to rise and fold her hands in
greeting. Pavananjay, seeing her effort, took her hand and gently led her back
to the bed. || 171 ||  Her hand, now damp with sweat, was tingling with
excitement, as if it were sprouting new shoots, nourished by the nectar of her
husband's touch. || 172 ||  Vasantmala, after bowing to Pavananjay, spoke to him
with respect. Then, with a smile, she led him to another beautiful room, where
they sat comfortably together. || 173 ||  Pavananjay, however, was ashamed of
his earlier disrespect and could not bring himself to ask about her well-being.
|| 174 ||  Then, with a blush, he said, "My dear, forgive me for the disrespect
I showed you, a result of the influence of my karma. " As he spoke, his mind was
filled with anxiety. || 175 ||  Anjanasundari, her head bowed, replied in a soft
voice, her entire body still. || 176 ||

Here is the translation of the text with the Sanskrit words retained:  ---  In
the Padmapurana:  364 “O Lord, you have not caused any offense to me at all.
Now, as you are creating that most rare affection, it should be understood that
I have not been disregarded by you.” (177) “The life I have lived until now is
indeed dependent on your memory. Therefore, even the contempt you have shown me
has become of great joy for me.” (178)   Then, saying this, she placed her
finger on her chin and lifted her face slightly while looking at Pavananjaya. He
said: “O Devi! Forget all offenses, for I bow at your feet. May you attain
supreme bliss.” (179) After saying this, Pavananjaya placed his head at the feet
of Anjana. Anjana quickly attempted to raise him with her lotus-like hands.
(181)  However, Pavananjaya remained in that position and said, “O beloved! I
will only lift my head when you tell me that you are pleased.” (182) Then, when
Anjana said, “I have forgiven,” Pavananjaya immediately raised his head and
embraced her. At that time, her eyes were closing in joy. (183)  Having embraced
her, Anjana seemed to merge into her husband’s body as if fearing that there
would be no separation again. (184) Pavananjaya released Anjana from the embrace
and began to gaze at her with motionless eyes devoid of the usual playful
glances. (185)  Then, overwhelmed by love, he kissed Anjana on her feet, hands,
navel, breasts, cheeks, forehead, and eyes. (186) Not just once, but repeatedly
touching them with his sweaty hands, he kissed the same spots again, as it is
essential for lovers to engage in the beloved's service by kissing their faces.
(187)  Then, he drank from her lips, which were radiant as a lotus and seemed to
exude nectar. (188)   ---  This translation conveys the essence of the original
text while retaining important Sanskrit terminology. If you need further

Here is the translation of the provided text while retaining the original
Sanskrit words:  ---  **Sixteenth Chapter (षोडशं पर्व)** 365  Then, seeing the
broad buttocks (नितम्बफलकं) of Anjana bare of clothing, the heart of the wind-
vanquishing (पवनंजय) became disturbed by the speed of desire (कामके वेग) which
was akin to the mind’s own nature (मनभूवेगरङ्गितम्)  (॥190॥).   Thereafter,
having been compelled by a wonderful speed, the wind-vanquishing (पवनंजय),
taking hold of Anjana, who was soft like a lotus (कमल), held her tightly
(॥191॥).   Then, as the crafty (वैदग्ध्यं) would speak, like Apsara (काम) giving
commands and providing lessons akin to increased affection (अनुरागो), the love
activity of both couples attained a supreme increase (दम्पत्योर्वृद्धिमुत्तमाम).
At that time, the emotions in the minds of both (तत्र हि यो) could not be
expressed in words (॥192-193॥).  The supreme beauty (परम सन्दरी) Anjana,
elevating (आस्फालयन्) the cup-like breasts (स्तनयोः कुम्भयोरेप) and the
buttocks, was mounted by the elephant (महागजम्) of desire (कामदेवरूपी मत्त)
(॥194॥).   “Stop!” “Let go!”, “Hold on!”—in various sounds filled with lively
confusion, their love scene appeared like a great war (नानाशब्दसमाकुलम्,
युध्दम्) (॥195॥).   While taking the lower lip (अधरग्रहणे), Anjana, making loud
sounds (सी-सी), waved her hand, which appeared as if the sprout of a creeper
(लताया इव पल्लवः) was shaking (॥196॥).   The new nail indents on Anjana’s thighs
(जघनस्थलम्) appeared as if blue sapphires (नीलमणिको) had emerged from the earth
below (॥197॥).   Gazing at Anjana’s thighs, the wind-vanquishing (पवनंजय) was
not satisfied (तृप्ति), his eyes (नेत्र) fixed unblinkingly upon them (॥198॥).
With sweet mellifluous sounds, her bangles (चूड़ियों) produced a delightful
jingling, which resembled a swarm of bees buzzing (॥199॥).   The glances and
pupils of Anjana’s eyes appeared as if they adorned the elegance of blue lotuses
(नील कमलों) joined with restless bees (॥200॥).   After the union (सम्भोग), a
group of sweat droplets (पसीनों) appeared upon the face and breasts of Anjana,
which looked like a collection of pure pearls (मोतियों) (॥201॥).   Her lower lip
(अधरोष्ठ) had turned red due to the biting (दन्ताघात), making her look like a
row of blossoming Tesu flowers (टेसूके वनकी पंक्ति) (॥202॥).   This is due to
the consumption (उपभुक्त) by her husband (पतिके) (॥203॥).   ---  This
translation captures the essence and imagery of the original Sanskrit text while
preserving key terms.

Here is the English translation of the provided Sanskrit text, while retaining
the original Sanskrit words:  ---  In the Pappapurāṇa, after the celebratory
event was concluded, the weary couple, with their bodies fatigued, wished to
indulge in sleep. (20) However, since their minds were absorbed in contemplating
each other's virtues, sleep seemed to have fled out of jealousy. (205) Then,
with the beloved's head resting on the shoulder of the husband, and their arms
mutually embraced, they appeared to be infused with mutual love; their mouths
were fragrant due to the exhalation of sweet-scented breaths, and the expansive
chest had the shape of a lotus due to the close embrace. (206) A man's thigh was
positioned between the thighs of a woman, and in the desired regions, various
kinds of pillows were arranged. In such a state, like a celestial couple, that
Ānjanā and the son of the wind somehow attained sleep. At that time, their
bodies remained still, immersed in the ocean of touch-generated pleasure.
(207-209)  Then, as dawn broke, Ānjanā rose from the bed and began to serve her
husband, who sat nearby. (210) Perceiving the fragrance generated from their
union, she felt shy, yet at the same time, she was filled with joy as her long-
held desires were finally fulfilled. (211) Thus, those couple who previously
were fearful of merely seeing each other spent many nights enjoying each other
without restraint. (212) The senses of the couple, who were likened to the
divine couple with the name Dodunduka, were now preoccupied, detached from other
activities, and fully engaged with one another. (213)  Then, after enjoying the
pleasures, the wise friend, having forgotten the master's command, and being
aware of the heedlessness of his friend, when Vasantamālā entered, softly spoke
as he walked into the palace: (214-215) "O beautiful one! Rise, why are you
still sleeping? It seems as if you have been defeated by the splendor of your
face..."  ---   Please feel free to ask if you have any further questions or

The sixteen festivals, as they are called, are a time of great joy and
celebration.  Pavananjay awoke from his slumber, his body still languid from
sleep, his eyes red from the lingering effects of slumber, and a yawn escaping
his lips.  He rubbed his ear with the index finger of his left hand, and then
stretched his right arm, making a cracking sound.  He looked at his beloved, his
eyes cast down in shyness, and said, "Come, my friend."  He then rose from his
bed.  He smiled and asked, "Did you have a pleasant night?"  Pavananjay, in
turn, smiled and asked, "Did you have a good night?"  After this exchange,
Prahasit, who knew all the details and was a master of the art of statecraft,
sat down on a nearby comfortable seat, as directed by Anjana, and said to
Pavananjay, "My friend, get up, let's go.  Many days have passed since you have
been engaged in the work of honoring your beloved."  "It is best to leave now,
before anyone knows we are returning.  Otherwise, it will be embarrassing."
"Your commander, Rathanupuraka, and the king, Kairnaragit, who is eager to go to
your master, are waiting for you."  "Ravan, filled with respect, constantly asks
his ministers, 'Where is Pavananjay?'"  "I have devised this plan for your
departure.  Therefore, you should leave the company of your beloved now."  "You
must obey the orders of your master, Ravan, and your father, Prahlad.  Then,
after returning safely, you should continue to honor your beloved."  "I will do
as you say, my friend," said Pavananjay, and then, after performing the
auspicious rituals of the body, he embraced his beloved in secret, kissed her
trembling lips, and said, "My dear, do not worry, I am going.  I will return
soon, after fulfilling my master's orders."  "Stay," he said in a sweet voice.
And so, the moon, having lost its brilliance, was no more.

Here is the translation of the provided text from the Padmapurana into English
while retaining the Sanskrit words:  ---  In the Padmapurana,  368  Then,
grieving (विरहतो), the beautiful (मीता) one whose eyes (लोचना) are on your face
(वक्त्र) spoke, joining (कृत्वा) her lotus-like (करयुगाम्भोजां) hands: "O
beautiful (सुन्दरी) lady, I am indeed the Arya's son (आर्यपुत्र), having united
(कृतसंगमा) with you. Therefore, in your absence (विरहे), my womb (गर्भ) will
become an object of slander (निन्दा) in the future (भविष्यति).”   Thus, lacking
(निवेद्य) you, go (गच्छ) to the teachers (गुरुभ्यो) of womb birth (गर्भसंभवम्).
For long-term (दीर्घदर्शित्वं) welfare (क्षेमाय), it is fit (कैल्पते) for the
life-bearers (प्राणधारिणाम्).  Having been spoken to in this manner, she said,
“O goddess (देवि), earlier (पूर्वं) I left the house (गेहाद) without you
(त्वया). Now I am determined (निश्चितो) and am seeking (संनिधावहम्) the meeting.
Now, when going to them (तेभ्यः), I feel shame (त्रपे) to say (गदितुं) about
that reason (तदर्थं). Knowing (विज्ञाय) this strange behavior (चित्रचेष्टं),
people (जनः) will smirk (स्मेरतां) at me.   Therefore, as long as my womb (गर्भ)
does not manifest (नैति प्रकाशताम्) here, until then I shall not disturb
(जिष्यामि). Do not become (मा ब्राजीर्विमनस्कताम्) disheartened (विमनस्कताम्).
For the removal (प्रमाद) of this anxiety (नोदाहरणं), take (गृहाण) this bracelet
(वलयं) which is marked (कृतलक्षणम्) with my name (मन्नामकृतलक्षणम्); therein you
shall have peace (शान्तिः) for now (एतः मविष्यति).”  Saying this and giving the
bracelet (वलयं), repeatedly (मुहुः) soothing her (प्रियाम्), and ordering
(उक्त्वा) the proper (ठीक-ठीक) worship (सेवा) of the spring (वासन्तमाला), he
(पवनंजय) rose up (उत्तस्थौ) from the bed (शयनीयात्).  At that time, his bed
(शय्या) was covered (व्याप्त) with broken (टूटे हुए) pearls (मोती) from the
garlands (हार) of the pleasure season (सम्मदंनसे), filled with the fragrant
pollen (गन्धित पराग) of flowers (पुष्पगन्ध) which attracted (खिंचकर) bees
(भौंरे), and the sheet (चद्दर) laid over it was fluttering (लहरा रहा था); it
seemed like (जान पड़ती) the Ksheeradweepa (क्षीर द्वीप) situated amidst the
milky ocean (क्षीरसमुद्र).  Though Pavananjaya stood up (उत्तस्थौ), his mind
(मनसः) was absorbed (लग रहा था) in his beloved (प्रियाम्).  Fearing (भयसे) that
the falling (गिरनेसे) tears (अश्रु) on the earth (पृथ्वीक) might affect (बाधा न
आ जाये) the auspicious (मंगलाचार) rites, Anjana (अंजनाने) collected (समेटकर) her
tearful eyes (अश्रु नेत्रोंमें) and, therefore, could not see (देख सकती थी)
Pavananjaya as she left (जाते समय). Yet, she flew (उड़ गया) towards the sky
(आकाश) with her friend (मित्र).  Gautama Swami speaks to King Shrenika, saying
that in this world (संस्कृति), sometimes (कदाचिद) the beings (प्राणियोंको)
experience the consequences (कर्मपाकोदयात्) of their past deeds (स्वकृतकर्म).

from the original prose has been maintained, and the Sanskrit terms have been

## Sixteen Chapters  Even though happiness is temporary for living beings,
starting from birth, and death is inevitable, even then, there is unhappiness in
this world. Therefore, O noble beings, serve the sun of Dharma, as spoken by the
Jinas, which brings abundant and continuous happiness and destroys the darkness
of worldly suffering. ||243||  Thus ends the sixteenth chapter of the
Padmacharita, composed by the Acharya known as Ravishena, which describes the
union of Pavanajaya and Anjana. ||16||  **Notes:**  * **Pavanajaya and Anjana:**
These are characters from Jain mythology. * **Jinas:** The Jain Tirthankaras,
enlightened beings who have attained liberation. * **Dharma:** The Jain path to
liberation, which emphasizes non-violence, truthfulness, and self-control. *
**Bhavyas:** Souls who are destined to attain liberation. * **Padmacharita:** A
Jain text that narrates the life stories of the Tirthankaras.

### Chapter Seventeen  After some time had passed, special signs indicating the
presence of a fetus appeared in the body of Anjana, the daughter of King
Mahendra. 1. Her complexion turned white as if it had been obtained through the
fame of Hanuman residing in her womb. Her gait, filled with the intoxication of
a mighty elephant, became even more sluggish. 2. The breasts, which had turned
dark, became exceedingly elevated, and due to laziness, she only raised an
eyebrow to signal where speech was necessary. 3. Thereafter, noticing these
signs, her envious mother-in-law questioned her, "Who has done this act to you?"
4. In response, Anjana folded her hands in greeting and recounted the entire
previous story. Although the son of the Wind had discouraged her from revealing
this account, when she found no other course, she was compelled to set aside her
shyness and disclose all the news. 5.  Thereupon, Ketumati, angered and with
great cruelty, spoke to her in a tone as hard as stone. When Ketumati was
uttering harsh words to Anjana, it seemed as if she was beating her with sticks.
6. She proclaimed, "O sinner! He who, being filled with extreme hatred, does not
wish to even see your form or allow your words to reach his ears, that
courageous son of the Wind has gone out from the house after asking his own
people. O without shame! How can he engage with you?" 7-8. "Cursed are you, O
sinner, who taints a bright offspring like the rays of the moon and engages in
this despised deed in both worlds!" 9. "It seems that your friend Vasantamala
has given you this wise thought, which is just right, for what do the servants
of courtesans and loose women do aside from this?" 10. At that time, although
Anjana showed the hard evidence given by the son of the Wind, that wicked-
hearted woman did not believe her. Far from believing, she spoke sharply in a
very harsh manner. 11.

Chapter Seventeen 371 Having said this, the cruel one called his servant, Kar.
Kar bowed and stood before her, his eyes red with anger.  “Take this Mahendra-
puri-bound woman, along with her friend, and leave her there. Return
immediately.”  [12-13] Following his master’s command, Kar, ever-ready to serve,
placed Anjana and her friend, Vasantimala, in the chariot and set off towards
Mahendra-puri. Anjana’s body trembled with fear, she seemed like a vine uprooted
and tossed about by a fierce wind, she was consumed with worry about the great
sorrow that awaited her, her heart was melting like wax in the fire of grief.
She was speechless with fear, her eyes fixed on her friend, Vasantimala.  She
silently condemned the evil karma that had brought her to this state, and tears
flowed from her eyes like a stream of crystal, their source hidden in her bosom.
[14-18] As the day drew to a close, Kar reached the outskirts of Mahendra-puri.
He bowed to Anjana and spoke to her in a sweet voice, “My lady, I have done this
for you, as per my mistress’s command.  Do not blame me for your sorrow, for it
is your karma that has brought it upon you.” [19-20] Having said this, he helped
Anjana and her friend out of the chariot and returned to his mistress, reporting
that he had carried out her orders. [21] Seeing Anjana, whose radiance was
dimmed by the weight of her sorrow, the sun seemed to set, its light fading.
[22] The western sky turned red, as if Anjana, with her eyes red from constant
weeping, was looking towards the sun for protection, and her redness had stained
the sky. [23] The directions, as if grieving for Anjana’s sorrow, released a
torrent of vapor, turning the sky a somber grey. [24]

372 The birds gathered in nests were making a great commotion, as if they were
crying out in sorrow for Anjana's suffering. ||25|| Then Anjana, forgetting the
pain caused by hunger and thirst, was about to be swept away by the ocean of
slanderous suffering. ||26|| Fearful, she did not cry out loud, but wept
silently within herself. Her friend made a seat for her with the leaves of
trees, and she sat down on it. ||27|| That night, Anjana's eyes did not close in
sleep. It seemed as if the constant flow of hot tears, burning her, had filled
her with fear. ||28|| Her friend, having soothed her with her hand, had spent
the whole night comforting her. Anjana had endured the night with great
difficulty, or rather, she had spent the night like a year, enduring great
hardship. ||29|| Then, as dawn broke, Anjana, whose leaves had withered from
long, hot breaths, left her bed and went to the gate of her father's palace. Her
friend, who was as agreeable as a shadow, followed her, and people looked at her
with compassion. ||30-31|| Anjana's appearance had changed due to her suffering,
so the gatekeeper did not recognize her. Therefore, when she tried to enter, he
stopped her, and she stood there. ||32|| Then her friend told him everything.
Upon hearing this, the gatekeeper, whose name was Shilakapat, left a different
man standing at the gate and went inside. He bowed to the king, touched the
earth with his hand, and went to inform him privately of his daughter's arrival.
||33-34|| Then King Mahendra, who was sitting nearby, ordered his son, Prasanna
Kirti, to bring his daughter in with great pomp. ||35|| Then the king said
again, "Let the city be adorned, and let the army be assembled. I will
personally welcome my daughter." ||36|| Then the gatekeeper, having heard of his
daughter's character, told the king all about it, placing his hand on his mouth.

The Seventeenth Chapter  Then, hearing this, the father, in order to punish his
daughter, became extremely angry and said to his son, Prasanna Kirti, "Drive
that sinner out of this city. Hearing her story, my ears feel as if they have
been struck by a thunderbolt." ||38||  Then, Mahotsaha, a minister who was very
dear to the king, said, "O King, it is not right to do this to her." ||40||
"Just as Vasantmala has spoken to the gatekeeper, perhaps it is the same in this
case. It is not right to hate her without reason." ||41||  "Ketumati is cruel,
influenced by worldly gossip, and completely thoughtless. She abandoned her
daughter without any fault." ||42||  "Just as this daughter, who is devoted to
virtuous conduct, was abandoned by her wicked mother-in-law, so if you also
reject her, where will she go for refuge?" ||43||  "Like a deer that has seen a
tiger, this innocent woman, terrified by her mother-in-law, has come to you for
refuge, who are like a great forest." ||44||  "This young girl is suffering as
if from the scorching rays of the summer sun, and knowing you to be like a great
tree, she has come to you." ||45||  "This unfortunate woman, like Lakshmi who
has fallen from heaven, is extremely distraught and trembling like a creeper due
to the scorching heat of slander." ||46||  "She has been greatly humiliated by
the gatekeeper's refusal to let her in. Therefore, she has covered her entire
body with her clothes, including her head." ||47||  "This daughter, who was
always pampered by her father's love, is now standing at the gate. O King, the
gatekeeper has told you this news." ||48||  "So, show her mercy and let her in,
for she is innocent. Indeed, everyone knows that Ketumati is wicked." ||49||
Just as a cluster of water droplets does not find a place on the lotus leaf, so
the words of Mahotsaha did not find a place in the king's ears. ||50||  The king
said, "Perhaps the friend, out of affection, has spoken untruthfully. How can we
be certain without knowing the truth?" ||51||

374 Padmapurana Therefore, this woman of questionable character should be
expelled from the city immediately.  A stain does not arise in a pure lineage
like ours. ||52|| A woman of pure conduct, graceful, and with charming actions,
is dearly loved by all.  But where are these qualities in her? ||53|| Those
great souls, possessing immense fortitude, are extremely pure and have not
accepted women as their wives, who are the root cause of faults. ||54|| The
acceptance of women as wives bears such fruit.  If, by chance, a woman becomes
subject to reproach, she desires to enter the earth. ||55|| Those who have been
made to believe in her through great sorrow, let them stay away.  Even my mind
is now filled with doubt in this matter. ||56|| I have heard many times that she
is an object of hatred to her husband, who does not even want to look at her.
Therefore, it is certain that the child in her womb is not his. ||57||
Therefore, if anyone else gives her shelter, I will kill him with my own hands.
This is my vow. ||58|| Thus, enraged, the king, before anyone else knew, had
Anjana expelled from the palace gates along with her friend.  At that time,
Anjana's body was filled with sorrow. ||59|| Seeking shelter, wherever she went
to the homes of her relatives, she found the doors closed by the king's order.
||60|| It is right, for where the father is angry and shows his disapproval,
what trust can be placed in others who act according to his wishes?  What hope
can be placed in them? ||61|| Thus, rejected everywhere, Anjana became extremely
distraught.  Her body was drenched in a torrent of tears.  She said to her
friend, "Mother, why are we wandering here?  O friend, because of our sins, this
whole world has become stone-hearted, that is, everyone's heart has become hard
like stone." ||62-63|| Therefore, let us go to that forest.  Whatever is to be,
let it happen there.  Death is the greatest happiness compared to this
humiliation and the sorrow that arises from it. ||64|| How can one be certain if
someone has spoken otherwise? ||51||

## The Seven-Month Festival ### 375  Thus speaking, she entered the same forest
along with her friend. Like a deer, bewildered and frightened by the king of the
deer, she entered the forest.   Weary from the wind and sun, tormented by the
pain of sorrow, she sat down at the edge of the forest and began to lament.
Alas! I am a wretched, unfortunate soul. Fate, the bringer of sorrow, has
destroyed me without reason. What a terrible thing! Where can I seek refuge?
After crossing the ocean of misfortune, my lord somehow attained happiness, but
driven by evil deeds, he has abandoned me.  Women who are tormented by their
mothers-in-law and others, seek refuge in their father's home. But my misfortune
has deprived me even of that.  My mother did not protect me either. It is right,
for noble women follow the wishes of their husbands.  Oh, my lord! You had said
that your womb would not be revealed and I would come to you. Why do you not
remember that promise? You were so compassionate.  Oh, mother-in-law! How could
you abandon me without any examination? Surely, there are many ways to test the
character of those who are doubtful.  Oh, father! You nurtured me in your lap in
my childhood and always kept me with great love and affection. How could you
decide to abandon me without any examination?  Alas, mother! Why did not a
single good word come out of your mouth? Why have you abandoned that
unparalleled love?  Oh, brother! I am your sister, born from the same womb, and
I am in great distress. Why did you not make any effort to protect me? You are
so cruel.  When you, the leaders among our relatives, are in this state, what
can the distant relatives do?  Or what is the fault of all of you? The season of
virtue has ended, and now my tree of sin has borne fruit. I am compelled to
serve it.  Her friend, her heart filled with sorrow and her courage shattered,
echoed her lament.

376 In the forest, Vasantmala was lamenting, her cries echoing like those of a
distressed animal. Even the deer shed large tears upon hearing her. ||79||
After weeping for a long time, her eyes turned red. Her wise friend embraced her
and said, "My dear, your weeping is in vain. The fruits of your past actions
have ripened, and you must bear them with closed eyes." ||80-81|| "O Goddess,
Karma resides behind, before, and beside all beings. Where then is there room
for sorrow?" ||82|| "Even the gods, whose bodies are adorned with the eyes of
hundreds of Apsaras, experience ultimate suffering when their merit ends."
||83|| "People think differently and receive different fruits. The true Guru is
the Law, who observes the actions of the world." ||84|| "Sometimes, the Law
destroys a beneficial thing in an instant, and sometimes it brings something
unexpected and unimaginable." ||85|| "The paths of Karma are diverse and
unpredictable. Therefore, do not grieve and cause pain to the fetus." ||86|| "O
Goddess, endure the fruits of your own actions, even if it means clenching your
teeth and hardening your heart like stone. This is something you must bear."
||87|| "Indeed, you are enlightened, and my teaching seems like a rebuke. Tell
me, what is it that you do not know?" ||88|| Saying this, the friend, eager to
console her, wiped her red eyes with trembling hands. ||89|| "This place is
devoid of shelter, my dear. Therefore, let us rise and go to the side of this
mountain." ||90|| "Let us find a cave inaccessible to evil creatures, where we
can stay for a while for the well-being of the fetus." ||91|| Following her
friend's advice, she began to walk. However, she was unable to walk far due to
the weight of the fetus. ||92||

### Translation into English  **Chapter on the Sevenfold Path** 377
Accompanying the great forest-holding, the mountain of time,   Filled with the
net of wild beasts, that is endowed with a dreadful sound.   Large as the sun,
held back by the great storm,   Noble in form, and difficult in its path of
righteousness.      With great difficulty, she set foot on the path of the
matanga flower,   In the abode of the matanga flower, she attained a mind that
is inaccessible.   Even as a powerful friend in the sky,   Bound by the ties of
love, she followed like a shadow.      Having reached that dreadful, dense
wilderness,   She trembled as she entered the threatening thicket.   After
knowing her disarray, taking her by the hand,   The friend spoke gently: "Do not
be afraid, my mistress!"      Thus, the friend, placing her supporting hand on
her,   With hair cascading like the soft grass,   Thereupon, in various places
on the ground, she laid her feet down again,   Bearing her body, which was heavy
with the load of sorrow.      She strove to ascend, dispatching the rushing
waterfalls,   Remembering her family, all harsh in their conduct.   She
criticized her own situation and endlessly blamed her fate,   Fearing the bonds
like the tendrils of a creeper that entwined every limb.      With the
frightened eyes of a doe,   She carried the weariness of her efforts, pouring
forth sweat,   Her garments tangled in thorny trees,   She stood there for long,
trying to untangle herself.      Her feet, stained with blood, appeared as
though   Decorated with the color of red lac.   From the burning heat of sorrow,
her body became exceedingly dark,   Even the slightest rustling of leaves
terrified her.      Her body trembled in fear,   Her thighs stiffened from the
weight of dread.   Thus, she found it exceedingly difficult to walk.   The
matanga flower, beset by wild beasts and fearful sounds, was approached with
diligence;  Alas! Although her friend was capable of soaring in the sky,   Bound
by the ties of love, she moved like a shadow on foot alongside her.   When
approached by that dreadful wilderness,   All of Anjana's body quivered in
fearful anticipation.    After observing her restless state,   The friend
grasped her hand and, with great respect,   Encouraged her gently, saying, "My
mistress! Do not fear, come here."    Anjana, wishing to receive support, placed
her hand on her friend’s shoulder,   Yet her hand frequently slipped downwards.
Whenever a thorn pricked her foot,   Poor Anjana would close her eyes and stand
still in distress.    Each time she lifted her foot,   She would cry out and
then replace it down again,   Straining to bear the weight of her body,   She
crossed rushing waterfalls with great difficulty.    She frequently remembered
her own relatives,   Who were entirely indifferent in their dealings.
Sometimes she reproached herself,   At other times, she repeatedly blamed her
fate.    Creepers wrapped around her body, and it seemed,   As if they were
overpowering her with compassion, almost hugging her.   Her eyes, restless like
those of a frightened deer,   Sweat flowed from her weary body,   And when her
garments caught on thorny trees,   She would bend there for a long time, trying
to disentangle herself.    Her feet turned red with blood,   Seeming as if
adorned with red lacquer.   Her body darkened, burned by the fire of sorrow,
And even the movement of a leaf would terrify her.    Her body quaking, she
found it exceedingly difficult to proceed.   This was the narrative of Anjana,
filled with fear and anxiety,   Depicting the struggles of the journey through
the dark wilderness.

378 The very dear-speaking friend, repeatedly making her rest, reached the foot
of the mountain, and Anjana, filled with sorrow, reached there slowly. ||106||
There, she was unable to hold her body, her eyes filled with tears. She ignored
her friend's words and sat down in great sorrow. ||107|| She said, "I am unable
to take even a single step from here. I will stay here, and death is preferable
to me." ||108|| Then, the clever friend, filled with love, comforted her with
words that were dear to her heart. After making her rest, she bowed and said to
her friend with love, ||109|| "Look, look, this excellent cave is nearby. Be
happy, get up, we will both stay comfortably in that cave." ||110|| "Many
creatures roam here, performing actions with their hands, and you also have to
protect your womb. Therefore, O mistress, do not make a mistake." ||111|| Thus
spoken to, Anjana, filled with sorrow, rose to go, urged by her friend and
afraid of the forest. ||112|| At that time, these two women did suffer in the
forest, but they did not go to the conqueror of the wind. This should be
understood as due to their great virtue, lack of command, or shame. ||113||
Then, the friend, supporting her with her hand, somehow crossed that uneven
ground and brought Anjana to the door of the cave with great difficulty. ||114||
They were both very tired from walking on the uneven rocks, and they were also
afraid to enter the cave suddenly, so they sat outside for a moment. ||115||
After resting for a long time, they cast their slow gaze upon the cave. Their
gaze seemed like a garland of withered red, blue, and white lotuses. ||116||
Then, they saw on the pure, even, and clear stone floor, a sage, the possessor
of the wealth of the charanas, seated on a couch. ||117|| The sage's breathing
was steady and regular. He had placed his eyes on the tip of his nose, his body
was relaxed, and he was motionless like a pillar. ||118||

The Seventeenth Chapter  They were motionless, like a pillar, without any
movement or shaking. ||118|| They had placed their right hand, raised, on the
palm of their left hand, which was resting on their lap. They were still, and
their minds were as deep as the ocean. ||119|| They were meditating on the true
nature of things, according to the teachings of the Jinas, free from all
attachments, pure like the sky, and as light as the wind. ||120|| Seeing them,
one would have felt a fear like that of seeing a mountain peak. They were
endowed with great fortitude, and their bodies, though gentle, were radiant.
After looking at them for a long time, they realized that these were indeed
great Muni-rajas. ||121||  Then, those two women, who had served Muni-rajas many
times before, went to the Muni-raja with joy, and in a moment, they forgot all
their sorrows. ||122|| They circumambulated him three times, with devotion,
joined their hands in salutation, and their eyes sparkled with joy, as if they
had found a dear friend in the Muni-raja. ||123|| It was just at that time that
the Muni-raja ended his meditation, of his own accord. This is how it is for the
blessed ones, their actions are always in accordance with the occasion. ||124||
Then, those two women, whose hands were joined together, and whose tearless,
steady eyes were fixed on the Muni-raja's feet, said, "O Bhagavan! O you who
have a pure mind! O you who are endowed with excellent conduct! Is your body
well? For this body is the root of all our efforts." ||125-126|| "O Ocean of
virtues! Is your tapas increasing day by day? And O you who have conquered your
senses! Is your conduct free from obstacles, and full of great forbearance?"
||127|| "O Lord! We are asking you about your well-being in this way, because
this is the proper way to ask. Otherwise, who would not be worthy of your well-
being? You are the repository of all virtues." ||128|| "Those who take refuge in
men like you become virtuous. But what is the point of discussing good and bad
things about oneself?" ||129||  Saying this, they fell silent, their bodies
bowed in humility. When the Muni-raja looked at them, they were free from all
fear. ||130||

In the Padma Purana, The Shraman, with a calm and serene voice, like the nectar
of immortality, raised his right hand and spoke profoundly, saying: "O Kalyani!
All is well with me due to the influence of my past actions. But, my child, all
this is the result of one's own actions." (131-132) "Behold the play of karma,
where this innocent daughter of King Mahendra has been banished by her brothers,
cast out of her home and subjected to great disrespect." (133) Then, the great
sage, who knew everything without being told, was approached by Vasantmala, her
mind filled with curiosity and great respect. Bowing down to him, she eagerly
sought the well-being of her mistress, as if showering his feet with the
radiance of her eyes. (134-135) "O Master! I humbly request you to kindly answer
my question. For the actions of those like you are always for the benefit of
others." (136) "Why did this Anjana's husband remain detached for so long, and
why has he now become attached? Why has Anjana been subjected to suffering in
the great forest? And what unfortunate soul has taken refuge in her womb,
causing this unfortunate woman to face the uncertainty of life?" (137-138) Then,
Amitagati, the sage, well-versed in the three knowledges - Shruta, Avadhi, and
Manahparyaya - spoke about Anjana's story, as it truly was. For this is the
nature of the wise. (139) "My child, listen! I will tell you why this Anjana has
suffered such pain. It is the result of her past sins, now reaching their
fruition." (140) "In the Jambudvipa, in the Bharat Kshetra, there was a city
called Mandara, where a righteous householder named Priyanandi resided." (141)
"His wife was named Jaya. From her, Priyanandi had a son named Damayanta, who
was blessed with great fortune and adorned with auspicious qualities." (142)
"Then, when the spring season arrived, a grand festival took place in the city.
Damayanta, along with his friends, enjoyed himself in the beautiful garden,
which was like the Nandanavana, filled with people from the city." (143) 1.

## The Saptavasa Parva ### 381  The Damyant, adorned with white powder and
ornaments like earrings, was enjoying himself with his friends.  Then, while he
was staying there and playing, he saw the Digambara monks, who were engaged in
meditation, study, and other practices, standing nearby.  Like a ray of light
emanating from the sun, he, shining brightly, left his group and went to the
assembly of monks, who were as steadfast as the peaks of Mount Meru.  Then,
after paying homage to the monks and listening to the teachings of Dharma, he
became endowed with right faith and adhered to the rules.  At one time, he
performed a seven-fold Parana for the monks and, after death, attained the
heavenly abode.  There, due to the influence of his past actions, rules, and
charity, he enjoyed excellent pleasures. He was always adorned with a garland of
blue lotuses, whose brilliance was like the eyes of hundreds of goddesses.  From
there, he was reborn as the son of King Harichandra and Queen Priyangulakshmi in
the city of Mriganka, located on this Jambudvipa. He was named Singhchandra, a
master of arts and skills. Although he was one, he was present in the hearts of
all beings.  Even in that existence, he renounced worldly pleasures after
receiving guidance from the monks and, at the end of his life, went to heaven.
There, he was like the sun, causing the lotus gardens of the goddesses' faces to
bloom, and he enjoyed the supreme happiness that was obtained merely by his
will.  From there, he was reborn as the son of King Sukantha and Queen
Kanakodaya in the city of Arun, located on the Vijayardha mountain in this
Bharat Kshetra. He was named Singhvahana, and his virtues attracted the hearts
of all people.  There, he experienced the supreme joy of embracing women who
could steal the attention of Apsaras, and he enjoyed the generous pleasures like
a god.  At one time, he attained enlightenment in the Tirtha of Sri Vimalnath,
and after entrusting his kingdom and wealth to his son, Meghavahana, he departed
from the world.

382 In the Padma Purana, a sage named Lakshmitilaka, who was filled with great
compassion and had a clear understanding of the impermanence of the world,
became a disciple of the great sage, Singhvahana. ||15|| He diligently followed
the proper vows as prescribed by the Jinas, and through contemplation on
impermanence and other such truths, he purified his mind. ||159|| He practiced
austerities that were beyond the capacity of ordinary people, and he endured the
burning heat of the sun. He always held fast to the three jewels, which are the
source of true liberation. ||160|| Although he was capable of preventing harm
due to the various powers he had attained, he remained calm and endured the
suffering inflicted by his enemies, who were like fierce lions. ||161|| When his
lifespan came to an end, he entered into a state of pure meditation and,
piercing through the celestial realms of the gods, he attained the highest
heaven, the Lantva. ||162|| There, he enjoyed the pleasures of that realm, which
were in accordance with his desires, and he remained aloof from the knowledge
and speech of the deceitful beings. ||163|| Driven by the remaining merit he had
accumulated, this great being, who was destined for ultimate liberation and a
recipient of happiness, left the Lantva heaven and entered the womb of Anjana.
||164|| Thus, I have described the conception that took place in the womb of
your mistress. Now, O Vasantmala, who is devoted to good deeds, listen to the
cause of the sorrow that arises from her separation. ||165|| When this Anjana
was in the realm of Kanakodara, she had a companion named Lakshmi. Her soul was
purified by right faith, and she was always devoted to the worship of the
saints. ||166|| She had a statue of the Jina, the Lord of Lords, installed in a
part of her house, and she worshipped it with devotion, offering praise with a
joyful countenance. ||167|| However, because Kanakodara was a great goddess, she
became filled with pride and anger towards her companion. Not only that, she had
the statue of the Jina thrown out of the house. ||168|| At that time, a nun
named Samyamsri entered her house to beg for alms. Samyamsri was renowned
throughout the world for her austerities. ||169||

## Chapter 17  Seeing her (the woman) in such a state, the Sadhu felt great
compassion. For the Sadhu community desires the welfare of all beings. || 171 ||
Even without being asked, the Sadhu, inspired by devotion to the Guru, begins to
preach the Dharma to the ignorant beings for their benefit. || 172 ||  Then, the
one adorned with the ornament of good conduct, spoke to her in these words,
filled with sweetness. || 173 ||  "O Blessed one, listen with an open mind. You
are adorned with the supreme radiance, the king honors you, and your body is a
vessel of pleasures. || 174 ||  Wandering through the four gatis, this being is
always afflicted with suffering. When the effect of the bitter karma subsides,
it attains the state of a human being. || 175 ||  O Radiant one, you have
attained the human birth through the accumulation of merit. Do not engage in
despicable conduct. You are capable of performing good actions. || 176 ||  One
who, having obtained the human birth, does not perform good deeds, loses the
jewel that has come into his hands, due to delusion. || 177 ||  The actions of
body, speech, and mind that are beneficial and conducive to the welfare of
others are the same for all living beings. || 178 ||  Those who engage in good
deeds with the intention of their own welfare are considered superior in this
world, while those who engage in despicable conduct are numerous. || 179 ||
Even those who are self-fulfilled, rescue beings from the ocean of suffering
through their teachings and guidance. Those who are the best of the best, the
Dharma-wheel-turners, the Arhats, those who despise their image, the deluded
beings, experience suffering that extends over countless lifetimes. Who can
fully describe the suffering that they experience? || 180 - 182 ||  The Arhats
are in a state of equanimity. Therefore, they do not feel joy towards those who
seek refuge in them, nor do they feel hatred towards those who harm them. || 183
||  However, beings experience happiness and suffering due to their own good and
bad karma, which arise from their actions towards others. || 184 ||  Just as a
being removes the suffering caused by cold through the use of fire, and the
suffering caused by hunger and thirst through the use of cool water, so too, the
suffering caused by disrespect is removed through the practice of Parana. || 185

In the Padma Purana, it is said that just as the enjoyment of food and water
relieves hunger and thirst, similarly, the worship of the Jinas brings happiness
to beings, and their disregard brings supreme suffering. This is natural.   It
is certain that whatever suffering is seen in the world arises from sin, and
whatever happiness is seen is obtained from past good deeds.   You have obtained
this wealth, a king as your husband, and a son who performs miraculous deeds,
all due to your punya. You are praiseworthy among beings.   Therefore, act in
such a way that you will obtain more happiness. O Bhavyā! Do not fall into a pit
while the sun is shining, as I have told you.   If I had not instructed you, and
you had fallen into hell with its terrible torments, it would have been a great
negligence on my part.   Upon hearing this, Kanakodari was terrified of the
suffering that would arise in hell. At that very moment, with a pure heart, she
embraced the supreme Samyak Darshan.   She also accepted the dharma of a
householder and performed austerities according to her strength. It seemed to
her as if she had been born anew due to the association with dharma.   She
installed the image of the Arhant Bhagavan in its former place and worshipped it
with various fragrant flowers.   Considering herself fulfilled by having engaged
Kanakodari in dharma, the Aryikā Samyamshrī, filled with joy, went to her own
place.   Kanakodari, who was attached to her home, also accumulated punya and at
the end of her life went to heaven. There, she enjoyed the highest pleasures and
then, falling from there, she was born as a daughter named Anjanā to Queen
Manovegā, the wife of King Mahendra in the city of Mahendra.   She was born into
a prosperous and pure family due to the remaining portion of the punya she had
accumulated in a previous life, and she obtained a most excellent husband.   She
had kept the image of the Trikālaya-worthy Jina Bhagavan outside her house for
some time, and because of that, she experienced this suffering.   When, before
her marriage, she was praising the qualities of Vidhyutprabha and criticizing
Pavanajaya in front of him, Pavanajaya...

Here is the English translation of the provided text, preserving the Sanskrit
words:  ---  **Saptavasha Parva**   385  Having heard this, he who was concealed
in the cow-window fell into a rage due to enmity towards her. As he set out for
battle, he saw another lady resembling a Chakravaki, and, struck by separation,
he swiftly sank into the beautiful mind-lake.   201. Just as a friend is kindly
led to his beloved at the appropriate time, having taken the embryo, he left to
fulfill his father's command.   202. Thus saying, the eminent sage, endowed with
great compassion, spoke again, like amrit flowing from the autumnal skies.
203. “You, suffering child, are afflicted by this sorrow due to the fruits of
your actions. Therefore, do not again engage in this evil act.”   204. The
happiness that arises in this world comes, indeed, primarily from devotion to
the Jineshvara.   205. Therefore, be a devotee of the Jineshvara, who rescues
from worldly existence, and perform puja to the munis according to your
capability.   206. Fortunately, you have attained knowledge through the great
restraint of the noble Arya at that time. That noble one uplifted you, who were
sinking into downfall, as if pulling you up by the hand.   207. This extremely
fortunate embryo has taken refuge in your womb, and will become a recipient of
many great auspiciousness in the future.   208. O beautiful one! From this
embryo, you will attain supreme prosperity. No divine being can diminish its
prowess.   209. In a little while, you will unite with your husband, thus keep
your mind happy and free from negligence, O auspicious one.   210. Upon hearing
this from the sage, the two friends, who were exceedingly joyful and whose
lotus-like eyes blossomed, bowed to the sage repeatedly.   211. After that, the
sage with a pure heart, having bestowed blessings upon both of them, went to a
place suitable for restraint in the sky.   212. That eminent sage remained in
the cave in the posture of Parayankasana; thus, in time, that cave came to be
known on earth as "Payank Cave."   213. Thus, King Mahendra...  1. Thus spoke M.
2. You are referred to M.   3. By devotion M.   4. You (are) K.   5. Having been
well-fed M.   6. Free from negligence B.  ---   Let me know if you need further
assistance or clarifications!

## Chapter 386  **386**  In the Padma Purana, Mahendra's daughter, Anjana,
remained in the cave, awaiting the time of her delivery, after the Muni's
assembly had purified her. (215)  Vasantmala, rich in knowledge and strength,
fulfilled her desires regarding food and drink. (216)  Then, the Sun, as if
unable to bear the sight of Anjana, separated from her beloved, desired to set,
out of great compassion. (217)  The Sun's rays, like those depicted in a
painting, became dim, as if they too were saddened by Anjana's sorrow. (218)
The Sun's orb, gathering the rays that were clinging to the peaks of mountains
and trees, suddenly descended, as if it too was overcome by Anjana's grief.
(219)  Then, the evening, red like the angry gaze of an approaching lion,
covered the entire sky in an instant. (220)  After that, as if urged by an
impending calamity, a line of darkness arose, like a Vetali emerging from the
netherworld. (221)  The birds, who had been making a commotion earlier, became
silent and perched on the branches of trees, as if terrified by the sight of the
line of darkness. (222)  The sounds of jackals, fierce like the thunder of a
great thunderbolt, began to echo, as if the approaching calamity had started
beating its drums. (223)  Then, a fearsome lion appeared, shaking its mane, red
with the blood of elephants, and bearing a crooked brow, like the line of a
finger on a death warrant. (224)  It emitted powerful, echoing roars, as if
tearing the entire sky into pieces, and it repeatedly thrust its tongue, as
agile as the flames of a conflagration, into the vast abyss of its mouth,
destroying countless beings. (225)  Anjana, hearing this account of her past
life, was astonished and repeatedly condemned the evil deeds she had committed
in her previous birth. (214)  Gautama Swami said to King Shrenik, "O King!
Anjana, purified by the assembly of the Munis, remained in that cave, awaiting
the time of her delivery." (215)

The lion was bearing sharp, pointed, dense, crooked, fierce teeth, which were as
sharp as Kusha grass and terrifying even to death. He was carrying a fierce,
red, blazing eye, like the sun at the time of destruction, which was engulfing
all directions. His tail was placed on his head, he was digging the earth with
his claws, his chest was as wide as the banks of Kailasa, and he was carrying a
thick hip-region. All creatures were looking at him with fear, wondering if he
was death itself, or a demon, or the end of time, or the king of the dead, or
the Kali Yuga, or destruction, or the destroyer of even Yama (the god of death),
or the sun, or fire.  The echoes of his roar filled the large caves, and the
mountains seemed to be crying out in fear, their cries deep and profound. The
creatures were struck in their ears by his thunderous roar, like a heavy hammer,
and they began to make various efforts. The lion, who was looking at the
inaccessible mountain in front of him with his eyes, and who was filled with
pride, yawned and showed great anger. The lion, whose body was trembling like
grass flowers, and whose eyes were red-yellow and restless like a gucchi,
entered the cave of the mountain.  The deer, whose mouths had dropped the grass
and tender leaves, and whose bodies had become stiff with fear, stood there as
they were. The flow of the elephants' rut stopped, their eyes were rolling,
their ears were erect, their minds were still, and their bodies were motionless.
The group of female animals, including the deer, stood with their young ones
inside the circle, trembling with fear. All their eyes were fixed on the leader
of their herd. The female monkey, whose body was trembling with fear of the
lion's roar, decided to give up her body and food, thinking, "If I survive this
calamity, I will eat and live, otherwise not."

388 In the Padma Purana, Vasantmala, unable to bear the grief, quickly flew into
the sky and circled around like a bird, her mind troubled. ||24|| Drawn by her
love and virtues, she repeatedly came close to Anjana, but due to intense fear,
she would again ascend to the sky. ||241|| Seeing them both terrified, with
their hearts shattered, the Gandharva who resided in that cave was filled with
compassion. ||242|| His wife, Ratna Chula, a virtuous woman, with a
compassionate heart and quick speech, addressed her husband, Mani Chula, the
Gandharva. ||243|| "Look, my dear! See, a woman is standing here, terrified by
the lion, and another woman, connected to her, is circling in the sky." ||244||
"Oh, my lord! Please be merciful to me and protect this extremely distressed
woman. This noble lady, born into a good family, has somehow come to this
difficult place." ||245|| Thus addressed, the Gandharva, transforming into the
form of a Sharabha, created as if from all the terrifying substances of the
three worlds, ||246|| stood before the lion, his body covered with a multitude
of peaks, only three hands away from Anjana. ||247|| Then, a terrible battle
ensued between the lion and the Sharabha, filled with thunderous roars, as if
mocking the groups of lightning-illuminated rain clouds. ||248|| Even though
such a time had arrived, a time that instilled fear even in brave men, Anjana
remained fearless, meditating on the Jina in her heart. ||249|| Thus,
Vasantmala, circling in the sky, filled with great sorrow, lamented like a
cuckoo. ||250|| "Alas, princess! You were first afflicted by misfortune, and
then, when you somehow escaped that misfortune with great difficulty, you were
abandoned by all your relatives. ||251|| You have reached this terrible forest,
and somehow you have come to this cave. You have been comforted by the Muni, who
has informed you of the possibility of finding your beloved." ||252||

The seventeenth chapter  Now, O Devi, you will go to the mouth of the lion,
which is terrible with its fangs and the cause of the destruction of the proud
elephants. || 253 || Alas, O Devi, your time has passed, due to the will of the
wicked fate and because of my foolish mind. || 254 || O Lord, Pavana-jaya,
protect your wife. O Mahendra, why don't you protect your daughter? || 255 || O
wicked Ketumati, what have you done to her in vain? O compassionate one, why
don't you protect your daughter? || 256 || This princess is dying in the
desolate forest. O forest deities, please protect her. || 257 || What else could
be the meaning of the words of that Muni, who knows the true nature of the
world, and who has given a good omen? || 258 || Thus, weeping and swinging like
a swing, Vasantmala was quickly going and coming near her mistress, that is, she
was coming near with courage and then retreating due to fear. || 259 ||   Then,
struck by the blow of the Sharabha, the lion was destroyed, and the Sharabha,
having accomplished his purpose, disappeared into his own abode. || 260 || Then,
seeing the end of the battle between the two, like a dream, Vasantmala, drenched
in sweat, quickly went back to the cave. || 261 || Inside the cave, Vasantmala,
searching for Anjana with her hands as soft as leaves, was saying, "Where are
you? Where are you?" At that time, her fear had not completely subsided, so her
voice was choked. || 262 || Vasantmala knew by the touch of her hand that she
was lying completely still. Therefore, her mind was filled with anxiety,
wondering if she was alive or not. || 263 || Placing her hand on her chest, she
kept urging her, saying, "O Devi! Devi! Are you alive?" || 264 || Then, when
Anjana regained consciousness from the touch of Vasantmala's hand, and somewhat
understood that it was her friend, she said in a faint voice, "I am here." ||
265 ||   After a long time, she understood, and then the two friends...

390 In the Padma Purana, the remaining fear made the women, who were captivated
by the charms of the Chabi, feel as if they had been born anew. They stayed
awake all night, discussing the cruelty of their relatives. ||267|| Then, just
as Garuda destroys a serpent, the Gandharva destroyed the lion, and filled with
joy, he drank the highly potent liquor. ||268|| The learned woman, whose eyes
were sparkling, placed her arm on the Gandharva's thigh and said to him, ||269||
"O Lord! Grant me this opportunity, for I wish to sing now, as it is said that
after drinking liquor, one should sing a beautiful song." ||270|| Hearing this
sweet, divine, and heart-stealing music, the two women would also forget their
remaining fear. ||271|| Then, when midnight arrived and no other sound could be
heard, the Gandharva tuned his ear-captivating Veena and began to play. ||272||
And his wife, Ratnachula, with her eyes fixed on her husband's face, played the
Manjira, singing softly. Her song was capable of causing even the sages to feel
disturbed. ||273|| At that time, they were using four types of musical
instruments: the Ghan, Vady, Sushir, and Tat. The other members of the group
were keeping time with their hands, in a dignified manner. ||274|| The skilled
Dev, playing the Tabla, was concentrating on producing a deep sound, while the
skilled Dev, playing the flute, was moving his eyebrows gracefully. ||275|| The
Yaksha, who possessed a beautiful aura, was playing a Veena, which was as
radiant as coral and adorned with beautiful metaphors, using a Tambura. The
Gandharva, who understood the subtleties of the notes, was playing the seven
notes: Madhyam, Rishabh, Gandhar, Shadja, Panchama, Dhaivat, and Nishad, without
missing a beat. ||276-277|| While singing, the Gandharva used the three types of
rhythms: Druta, Madhy, and Vilambita, in their proper places, and he also used
twenty-one Murcchaanas, which made his eyes dance. ||278|| He sang like the
singers of the Devas, who are known for their "Ha-Ha-Hu-Hu" sounds. ||279||

## Saptadarsha Parva  **Verse 280:** The seventy-five sounds of the song were
composed of beautiful words connected to the qualities of the Jina.  **Verse
281:** (In Vidyutmala Vrutta) With devotion, I bow to the Arhant, the Lord of
Lords, who is worshipped by gods and demigods with flowers, offerings, and
various fragrances.  **Verse 282:** (In Arya Giti Chhandas) With utmost
devotion, I always bow to the one who is pure, the epitome of excellence in the
three worlds, the Muni Suvrata, whose feet are like the crown of the Indra, and
whose nails are like shining gems.  **Verse 283:** (In Anushtup) Then,
Vasantmala, whose mind was filled with wonder, praised that unprecedented and
extremely beautiful music.  **Verse 284:** Oh, what a song! What a song! Who has
sung this enchanting melody? This sweet-voiced singer has, as it were, drenched
my heart.  **Verse 285:** She said to her mistress, "Oh, Goddess! This is a god
who has protected us by driving away the lion."  **Verse 286:** I think this
melodious song, which is filled with the sweet sound of a woman's voice and all
the elements of music, was sung for us.  **Verse 287:** Oh, Goddess! Oh,
beautiful one! You, who possess excellent character, are not the object of
anyone's compassion? Even in the great forest, there are friends for the noble
ones.  **Verse 288:** With the destruction of this obstacle, it is certain that
you will be reunited with your husband. Or, does the Muni say otherwise?
**Verse 289:** Therefore, having taken refuge in this virtuous god, we should,
in this cave, which is purified by the Muni's seat, install the image of Muni
Suvrata and worship him with fragrant flowers for our happiness.  **Verse 290:**
Let us focus our minds on the happiness of giving birth to this child,
forgetting the pain of separation and the passing of time.  **Verse 291:**
(Verse 279 continued) Or, he was singing a song even more beautiful than that,
and this song is known among the Gandharva gods.  **Verse 291:** (Verse 280
continued) He was singing in seventy-five sounds, and his entire song was
composed of beautiful words connected to the qualities of the Jina.

The Padma Purana says, "Having attained supreme joy by meeting you, the mountain
is laughing as if with the swift streams. (292) The trees, bowed down by the
weight of their fruits, with their soft leaves swaying, and laughing with their
flowers, have attained joy. (293) The forest plains of this mountain, with the
sweet sounds of peacocks, mynas, parrots, and cuckoos, seem to be engaged in
conversation. (294) In this mountain, caves adorned with the shadows of various
metals, with groups of trees as their garments, and perfumed with the fragrance
of flowers, are shining like women. (295) In the ponds, lotus flowers, worthy of
being offered to the Jinas, are blooming, resembling your face. (296) O Vamini,
be patient, do not be overcome by anxiety. The gods here will bring you all
kinds of good fortune. (297) Now, at the beginning of the day, the birds are
chirping, as if they are making a joyful noise, knowing your healthy body. (298)
These trees, standing on the tips of their branches, and moved by the gentle
breeze, are releasing cool drops of dew, as if they are shedding tears of joy.
(299) To inform you of this, first, like a messenger, the red-hued evening has
been sent, and now, behind her, the sun is rising. (300) Hearing this, Anjana
replied, "O friend, all of you are my relatives. With you here, this forest is
like a city to me. (301) The person who serves someone in times of distress, in
ordinary times, and in times of celebration, is their true friend, while the one
who brings sorrow is an enemy, even if they are a relative. (302) Saying this,
they both placed the image of the Devadhideva Muni Suvrata Nath in the cave and
continued to worship him. Their food was provided by the power of knowledge.
(303) The Gandharva, filled with compassion, protected these two women from all
sides, making music every day in devotion to the Jina. (304)  1. Do not be
anxious. 2. What is the use of lamenting? 3. Food provided by the power of
knowledge.

## The Seven-Year Festival  393  Then, Anjana said, "My dear friend, my womb is
restless, and I am filled with anxiety. What will happen?" ||305||  Vasantmala
replied, "O beautiful one, the time for your delivery has surely arrived. Sit
comfortably." ||306||  Then, Vasantmala prepared a bed with soft leaves, and
Anjana gave birth to a son, just as the east gives birth to the sun. ||307||  As
soon as the son was born, the cave was filled with his radiant energy,
dispelling all darkness and making it seem as if it were made of gold. ||308||
Although it was a time for joy, Anjana, remembering both her families, felt a
sense of sorrow and wept while holding her son. ||309||  She lamented, "O son,
how can I celebrate your birth in this dense forest, a place of fear for
humans?" ||310||  "If you had been born in your father's or grandfather's house,
there would have been a great celebration, one that would have driven people mad
with joy." ||311||  "Seeing your face, like the moon, adorned with beautiful
eyes, who in the world would not be filled with wonder?" ||312||  "What can I
do? I am unfortunate and deprived of everything. Fate has given me this state of
suffering." ||313||  "All beings desire long life above all else. Therefore, my
son, my blessing is that you live to the highest state." ||314||  "That I am
alive, even in this forest where death is imminent, is a testament to your good
karma." ||315||  Hearing this, her friend, who was always helpful, said, "O
goddess, you are filled with blessings because you have received such a son."
||316||  "He is seen to be full of auspicious signs, and his beautiful body
carries immense wealth." ||317||  "The vines, with their six-petaled flowers and
swaying, delicate leaves, are dancing as if celebrating your son's birth."
||318||  "Because of your son's extraordinary energy, all that is auspicious
will come to pass, and misfortune will be meaningless." ||319||  1. Gocharam M.

394 Padma Purana While the two friends were thus conversing, a magnificent
chariot, bright as the sun, suddenly appeared in the sky. || 320 || Seeing it,
Vasantmala informed Anjana, who, filled with apprehension, began to speak again,
saying, || 321 || "Is this some enemy of mine, who will take away my son? Or has
some relative of mine arrived?" || 322 || Hearing her words, the chariot
remained stationary for a while, and then a compassionate Vidyaadhara descended
from the sky. || 323 || After parking the chariot at the entrance of the cave,
he entered, accompanied by his wives, his mind filled with anxiety. || 324 ||
Vasantmala welcomed him, and he sat down on a seat provided by his servant. ||
325 || After a moment's pause, he addressed Vasantmala, who was welcoming him
with great humility, in a deep voice, his words stirring the curiosity of the
thirsty chatakas, like the sound of thunder. His speech was adorned with the
brilliance of his teeth, which mingled with the radiance of the child. ||
326-327 || He said, "O Sumaryade! Tell me, whose daughter is this? Whose
auspicious wife is she? And why has she come to this great forest?" || 328 ||
"Her form does not match the character of a woman who has been condemned. How
then has she come to be separated from all her relatives?" || 329 || "Or
perhaps, in this world, there are often enemies without cause, who are driven by
their past deeds, even when they are in a position of neutrality." || 330 ||
Then Vasantmala, her throat choked with tears of sorrow, her eyes fixed on the
earth, spoke slowly, || 331 || "O Great One! Your words reveal your noble and
auspicious heart, for the shade of a tree that is the cause of disease is not
pleasant or joyful." || 332 || "Since you are a virtuous man, worthy of
receiving information, I will tell you what you wish to know. Listen." || 333 ||
"It is a principle that sorrow, when revealed to a virtuous man, is destroyed,
for it is the nature of the great to be the saviors of those who are in
distress." || 334 ||

The Seventeenth Chapter 395 Listen, this is the daughter of King Mahendra, known
as Anjana, who is filled with the glory of the world and has a pure heart. She
is the beloved wife of Pavanavega, the son of King Prahlad, whose mind is an
ocean of virtues. ||335-336|| Once, without informing his relatives, he went to
war, following his father's command, and conceived a child in her womb. He was a
friend of Ravana. ||337|| Although Anjana was innocent, her cruel and heartless
mother-in-law, driven by her wicked nature, sent her back to her father's house.
||338|| Her father, fearing the consequences of her misfortune, did not give her
a place in his home. It is true that noble people are often afraid of false
accusations. ||339|| This noble girl, abandoned by all her relatives, was left
alone in this great forest, like a deer, without any support. ||340|| I, a
servant of this kind-hearted woman, came here following the tradition of our
family. She, always cheerful, has made me her confidante. ||341|| This Anjana
has given birth to a son today in this forest, full of various hardships. I
don't know how this virtuous woman will find happiness and support. ||342|| I
have told you this story briefly, O virtuous one. I am unable to describe all
the suffering she has endured. ||343|| Then, from the heart of that Vidhyadhara,
filled with love that had melted due to Anjana's suffering, a voice emerged, as
if his heart was overflowing with emotion and had no space left for it to stay
inside. ||344|| He said, "O virtuous woman! You are my niece. I couldn't
recognize you because your appearance has changed due to our long separation."
||345|| "My father is Vichitrabhanu, and my mother is Sundaramalini. My name is
PratiSurya, and I live on the island called Hanuruh." ||346|| After saying this,
he recounted all the events of his childhood to Anjana, weeping as he spoke.
||347|| Then, recognizing her uncle from his narration, Anjana embraced him and
wept for a long time, her tears flowing like a river. ||348|| All her sorrow was
released with those tears. Indeed, the stability of the world lies in the
reunion of loved ones. ||349|| It is the nature of great men to rescue those who
are in distress. ||334||

396 Padma Purana Thus, overwhelmed with grief, they both wept. Vasantmala,
sitting beside them, also wept loudly. || 350 || Seeing them weep, the
Vidhyadhara women also wept out of compassion. Seeing them weep, the female deer
also wept. || 351 || At that time, a loud echo was coming from the cave-like
mouth, so it seemed as if the mountain was also weeping with large waterfalls.
|| 352 || And the birds, too, were making sounds out of compassion, so the
entire forest was filled with sound at that time. || 353 || After consoling her,
Prati-Surya washed Anjana's face and his own with water brought by a servant. ||
354 || The forest, which had become filled with sound, became silent again in
the same way as before. It seemed as if it had become silent to listen to the
story of these two. || 355 || After staying for a moment, when both of them came
out of the pit of sorrow, they asked each other about their well-being and told
each other about their families. || 356 || After that, Anjana spoke to Prati-
Surya's wives in turn. It is right, because virtuous people never fail in their
duty. || 357 || Anjana said to her maternal uncle, "Respected one! Tell me about
the condition of all the planets of my son." || 358 || Upon hearing this, the
maternal uncle asked the astrologer named Pashvang, who was proficient in
astrology, about the son's birth ceremony, i.e., he asked about the son's
planetary position. || 359 || Then the astrologer said, "Tell me the time of
birth of this auspicious son." Upon being asked this, Anjana told the time. ||
360 || Vasantmala, the friend who dispels all doubts, also said, "The child was
born today at night when half the night was left." || 361 || Then the
astrologer, who knew about auspicious times, said, "His body is adorned with
auspicious signs, which indicates that the child will be blessed with all kinds
of achievements." || 362 || "However, if you are not satisfied or if you think
this is a worldly ritual, then listen, I will tell you about his life in brief."
|| 363 || "Today is the eighth day of the bright fortnight of Chaitra. The star
is Shravana, the lord of the day is Vibhavasu." || 364 ||

Saptadashama Parva 397 The sun is situated in Aries, occupying a high position.
The moon is situated in the middle of Capricorn. [365] The fiery-bodied Mars is
in the middle of Taurus, and the son of the moon (Mercury) is situated in the
highest part of Pisces. [366] The preceptor of the Daityas (Jupiter) is high in
Pisces, and there Shani (Saturn) also is situated. At that time, the rising of
Pisces occurred for the chief of kings. [367] The sun fully observes Shani, and
the prince, with half his vision, observes the lord of the day. [368] The
preceptor (Jupiter) observes the lord of the day with his vision diminished by a
pada, and the lord of the day (the sun) observes the lord of speech (Jupiter)
with half his vision. [369] The lord of the day (the sun) observes the moon with
his full vision and speech, and the moon also observes him in the same way.
[370] The preceptor (Jupiter) observes Shani with his vision diminished by a
pada, and Shani, in the same way, regards the great one (Jupiter). [371] The
preceptor (Jupiter), seeing the preceptor of the Daityas (Shukra), observes him
with diminished vision, and Shukra also casts such a glance on him. [372] There
is no mutual dependence among the remaining planets. At that time, the strength
of the periods and places of rising of the planets is supreme. [373] The sun and
Mars convey his (the child's) royal dignity, and Shani declares his attainment
of perfection. [374] Even if one Jupiter alone were situated in a high position,
he would become the cause of the attainment of all auspiciousness. How much more
so when all the auspicious planets are situated in high positions! [375] At that
time, there was the Brahma yoga and the auspicious muhurta called Shubhashruti.
These two indicate the attainment of the happiness of the Brahma-sthana (the
state of liberation). [376] Thus, the astrophysical chart of this child
indicates the absence of all defects in the entire universe. [377] "After
worshipping the knower of time with a thousand gold coins, the sun, filled with
joy, said to his daughter (Anjana): [378] 'Come, my child, let us go to the city
of Hanuruhana. There, all the birth rites of this child will be performed.'"
[379] Thus addressed by the sun, Anjana, after bowing to the lord of the place
(the presiding deity) and begging pardon repeatedly, took the child on her lap.

In the Padma Purana, Anjana, accompanied by her family, emerged from the cave.
Standing near the aircraft, she resembled a forest goddess. The aircraft was
adorned with tinkling bells, as if it were filled with waterfalls, and adorned
with strings of pure pearls. It had lanterns hanging from it, and was decorated
with forests of glass bananas. Golden bubbles on it sparkled in the sunlight.
The aircraft was a rainbow of many jewels, and was adorned with hundreds of
colorful flags, making it look like a Kalpavriksha. It was made of precious
stones, and was filled with jewels. It was divine, and seemed to be surrounded
by heaven.  Seeing this, the child, filled with curiosity, jumped out of his
mother's arms and wanted to enter the aircraft. He seemed to have fallen from
his mother's lap into the cave of the mountain. Everyone, including Anjana,
cried out in alarm, trying to find the child. Anjana lamented in a sorrowful
voice, which even moved the hearts of animals. She said, "Oh, my son! What has
happened? What has fate done? After showing him a treasure filled with jewels,
why has it taken him away?" She continued, "I was already grieving for my
husband, and you were my only support. Now, fate has taken you away too."  Then,
everyone saw that the child was lying safely on a rock, which had broken into a
thousand pieces due to the force of the fall. He was playing with his thumb in
his mouth, and his face was adorned with a gentle smile. He was lying on his
back, and his hands and feet were moving. He had a beautiful body, and his
complexion was like a forest of red and blue lotuses, swaying in a gentle
breeze. His radiance illuminated the entire cave with a golden hue. Then,
Anjana, seeing her innocent child, picked him up and held him to her chest,
kissing his head.

The seventeenth chapter:  The king, Prati-Surya, then said, "Oh, what a great
wonder this is! Just as if by a thunderbolt, this stone mass has been
pulverized." (395)  "Even as an infant, his power surpasses that of the greatest
gods. What can be said of his youth? This body is surely his last." (396)
Knowing this, Prati-Surya, with his hands clasped in reverence, circumambulated
the child three times and, along with his wives, paid homage to his final body.
(397)  His wives, with their white, black, and red eyes, looked upon him with
smiles, as if they were worshipping him with garlands of white, blue, and red
lotuses. (398)  Then, Prati-Surya, placing his son and Anjana in a chariot,
departed for his own city, adorned with flags and arches. (399)  He then entered
the city, greeted by the townspeople bearing auspicious offerings. The sky was
filled with the sound of trumpets and other musical instruments. (400)  Just as
the gods celebrate the birth of Indra in heaven, so too did the Vidyadharas
celebrate the birth of this child in the city of Hanuruh. (401)  Because the
child was born in a mountain (Shaila) and later pulverized stones (Shaila), his
mother, along with his maternal uncle, named him "Shreeshala." (402)  Because he
received his birth rites in the city of Hanuruh, he became known throughout the
earth as "Hanuman." (403)  His body, whose actions filled the minds and eyes of
all beings with joy, and whose radiance was like that of a divine prince, played
in that city. (404)  Gautama Swami said to King Shrenik, "O King! By the power
of accumulated virtuous deeds from a previous life, even a thunderbolt, which
can pulverize mountains, becomes as soft as a flower. Even fire becomes as cool
as the rays of the moon, and a creeper, even if it is like a sword, becomes soft
and tender in the hands of beautiful women. (405)

400 Padma Purana Knowing this, be detached from the evil deeds which are skilled
in causing suffering, and be absorbed in the character of the Jina, which is
skilled in giving the best happiness. Oh! This sun of birth, which is endowed
with thousands of rays of disease, is constantly scorching the whole world with
great firmness. ||406|| Thus ends the seventeenth chapter of the Padma Charita,
narrated by the Acharya Ravishena, known as the Arsha, which describes the birth
of Hanuman. ||17|| The delicate arms of women become strong. ||405||

## The Eighteenth Chapter  This is the story of the birth of the great Sri Sail.
Now listen to the story of Vayu, the ornament of Magadha. ||1||  Vayu, as swift
as the wind, went to Ravana and, having received his command, engaged in battle
with Varuna in the midst of a battlefield filled with various weapons. ||2||
After fighting for a long time, Varuna was defeated and captured by Vayu. Khar-
Dushan had been captured by Varuna earlier, so he was released. Vayu took Varuna
to Ravana and made a treaty with him, making him subservient to Ravana. Ravana
greatly honored Vayu. ||3, 4||  Then, with Ravana's permission, Vayu, carrying
Kanta in his heart, quickly returned to his city with the great ministers. ||5||
Vayu entered the city, which was adorned with brilliant flags, arches, and
garlands, and was welcomed by the citizens, who were adorned with the finest
ornaments. ||6||  Then, leaving his work unfinished, Vayu went towards his
palace, where he was greeted by a group of city women standing in the windows,
who were overjoyed to see him. ||7||  Then, Vayu entered the palace, honored by
the elders and welcomed by his relatives with auspicious words. ||8||  There, he
paid his respects to the elders and was greeted by others. He sat in the
assembly hall for a while, engaging in pleasant conversation. ||9||  Then,
filled with anxiety, he ascended to Anjana's palace. At that time, he was filled
with his former emotions and was accompanied only by his laughing friend. ||10||
Seeing the palace devoid of his beloved, his mind, like a lifeless body, fell to
the ground in an instant. ||11||  He said to his laughing friend, "Friend, what
is this? Where is Anjana, the beautiful one with lotus eyes?" ||12||

402 PapPuran Without her, this house seems like a forest or the sky to me.
Therefore, let her news be known quickly. ||13|| Having learned the news from
his close circle, Prahasita spoke to Pavanjaya, telling him all the news, as it
was, that would cause him distress. ||14|| Hearing this, Pavanjaya, leaving his
family, immediately set out for Mahendra Nagar with his friend, filled with
anxiety. ||15|| Reaching near Mahendra Nagar, Pavanjaya, assuming his beloved
was in his arms, spoke to his friend, saying, "My friend, look at the beauty of
this city, where my beloved Anjana resides, adorned with beautiful charms."
||16-17|| "And where rows of palaces, like the peaks of Mount Kailasa, are
hidden by trees of the garden, shining with the brilliance of the monsoon
clouds." ||18|| Speaking thus, the best of men, Pavanjaya, reached the city,
with his friend, his heart filled with love, and speaking with him. ||19|| Then,
hearing of Pavanjaya's arrival, a group of people, led by his father-in-law,
came to greet him with offerings. ||20|| Led by his father-in-law, with a loving
heart, Pavanjaya entered his home, greeted with respect by the people of the
city. ||21|| He entered the house, longing to see his beloved, and sat there for
a while, engaging in conversation. ||22|| But even there, when he did not see
his beloved, he, filled with separation, asked a young girl who lived in the
house, "Little one, do you know if my beloved Anjana is here?" The girl, with a
sorrowful voice, replied, "Your beloved is not here." ||23-24|| Then, by those
words, Pavanjaya's heart was shattered as if by a thunderbolt, his ears filled
with hot, salty water, and he stood still, as if lifeless. His face, touched by
the frost of sorrow, lost its radiance. ||25-26|| Then, he left that city, as if
escaping from a demon, and wandered the earth, seeking news of his beloved.
||27||  1. Conversation. 2. Within reach. 3. Still. 4. From his father-in-law.
5. His beloved.

Ashtadasham Parva 28. Knowing that Vayukumara was afflicted by the disease of
the wind, the cheerful friend consoled him with kind words, saying, "Why, my
friend, are you so dejected? Compose your mind. You will soon see your beloved,
or how vast is this earth!" 29. He replied, "Go quickly, my friend, to Ravipura
and inform our gurus of this incident." 30. "I will not consider my life worth
living until I find my beloved, the beauty of the earth. I shall wander the
entire world in search of her." 31. Saying this, the dejected one somehow freed
himself from that sorrow and, laughing sadly, went to Adityanagari. 32. The wind
also mounted the celestial elephant and, roaming the entire earth, was filled
with this thought: 33. "Where has my tender-bodied beloved gone, who was
scorched by the fire of separation and carried me in her heart?" 34. "Was she in
the wilderness of widowhood, inflamed by the fire of separation, and now seeking
refuge in some direction?" 35. "Being endowed with truthfulness and simplicity,
and bearing the burden of pregnancy, has she been abandoned by Vasantamala in
the great forest?" 36. "Is she, with her eyes blinded by sorrow, wandering on a
difficult path, and fallen into an ancient well, hungry and surrounded by
pythons?" 37. "Or, distressed by pregnancy, has she, on hearing the terrifying
sound of wild animals, given up her life in fear?" 38. "Alas, parched by thirst,
with a dry palate and throat, has she been abandoned in the forests of Vindhya
and lost her life, which was as dear to me as my own breath?" 39. "Or, has the
innocent Mandakini, entangled in various crocodiles, descended and been swept
away by the fierce current of water?" 40. "With her feet wounded by the thorns
of Darbha grass and bleeding, is she unable to take even a single step and thus
met her death?" 41.

404 Perhaps she was taken away by some wicked Vidyaadhara who travels through
the sky. It is a great sorrow that no one brings me news of her. ||42|| Or
perhaps she has been lost due to the sorrow of a miscarriage and has gone to the
place of the Aryikas? She was a follower of Dharma. ||43|| Thinking thus, the
mind-distracted Pavananjay wandered the earth, but he did not see his beloved,
who captivated all senses and minds. ||44|| Then, consumed by separation, he saw
the whole world as empty and firmly decided to die. ||45|| He found no joy in
the mountains, nor in the trees, nor in the beautiful rivers, for he was
separated from Anjana, who was his everything. ||46|| It is right that
Pavananjay asked the trees for news of her, for those who are in sorrow are
devoid of reason. ||47||  Then, reaching the forest called Bhutarava, he
descended from the elephant and sat still like a sage, meditating on his beloved
for a moment. ||48|| He had thrown his weapons and armor on the ground with
disregard, while the dense branches of the trees above him blocked the sun.
||49|| The elephant named Ambargocar stood before him with great humility, and
Pavananjay, exhausted, spoke to him in a very sweet voice: ||50|| "O King of
Elephants! Now go, roam wherever your heart desires. Forgive me for my defeat,
for I was blinded by my love for Anjana and sought your help to find her."
||51|| "Graze on the green grass and the leaves of the Sallaki trees on the
banks of this river, and roam freely with your herd of elephants." ||52||
Pavananjay said all this, but the elephant, knowing his kindness and generous
nature, did not leave his sorrowful master's side, like a true friend. ||53||
Pavananjay had decided that if he did not find his beloved Anjana, he would die
in this forest. ||54|| For Pavananjay, whose mind was fixed on his beloved, a
night in the forest seemed longer than four years, filled with various thoughts
and anxieties. ||55||  1. Me na vidyate M., Kh., B., J. | 2. Duhkhatsute Kh. |

The Eighteenth Chapter  Thus, O King Shrenik, listen to this story. I will tell
you what your parents did after Pavananjay left.   When his friend told them
about Pavananjay, all his relatives were overcome with grief.   Then Ketumati,
overwhelmed with grief for her son, spoke with a mocking tone, her voice choked
with tears. "Oh, Prahasit, was it right for you to do this? To leave my son and
come alone?"  Prahasit replied, "Oh, Mother, he sent me with great effort. He
wouldn't let me stay there in any way."  Ketumati asked, "Where did he go?"
Prahasit replied, "Where Anjana is." Ketumati asked again, "Where is Anjana?"
Prahasit said, "I don't know. Those who act hastily without examining things,
they are bound to suffer later, those who are the life-force of people."
Prahasit also told Ketumati, "Your son made a firm vow that if he didn't see his
beloved, he would surely die."  Hearing this, Ketumati was deeply distressed and
began to wail. A group of women, their eyes streaming with tears, surrounded
her.  She cried out, "Without knowing the truth, what have I, a sinner, done?
That my son has been brought to the brink of life and death?"  "With a cruel
heart, a deceitful mind, and acting without thought, what have I, a fool, done?"
"This city, abandoned by Vayukumar, does not shine. Why just this city? Even
Vijayardhagiri does not shine, nor does the army of Ravana without him."  "Who
on earth is equal to my son, who made a pact even with Ravana, a pact that was
difficult even for him?"  "Alas, my son! You were the foundation of humility,
always devoted to honoring your teachers, the most beautiful in the world, with
your virtues known everywhere. Where have you gone?"  "Oh, my son, who loved
your mother like your own life, please soothe your mother's heart, burning with
the fire of your sorrow, with your comforting words, and make her free from
grief."

406 In the Padma Purana, while lamenting, they beat their chests severely. The
sorrowful-eyed Prahlad, with great difficulty, comforted the women. ||7|| Having
put on a brave face in front of all his relatives, Prahlad, eager to find his
son, left his city. ||72|| He summoned all the Vidyadharas who lived in the two
categories. They all came, filled with love, along with their families. ||73||
They, with their various radiant vehicles, followed the path of the sun. With
their eyes fixed on the deep forests, they diligently searched the earth. ||74||
Having learned this news from Prahlad's messenger, Pratibhana, bearing great
sorrow in his heart, informed Anjana. ||75|| Anjana, already sorrowful, became
even more distressed by this heavy grief. With her face washed with tears, she
began a sorrowful lament. ||76|| "Alas, my lord! You were the bond of my heart.
Where have you gone, leaving me, the one who constantly suffers?" ||77|| "Are
you still not giving up that ancient anger, which has made you invisible to all
the Vidyadharas?" ||78|| "Oh, my lord! Give me even one word, like nectar, for
the great souls never abandon the welfare of those in distress." ||79|| "I have
sustained my life only with the hope of seeing you. What use are these sinful
breaths to me now?" ||80|| "The desires I had made, to be united with my
husband, have been thwarted by fate." ||81|| "My dear one must have attained
that state, which this cruel heart has always feared, because of my bad luck."
||82|| "Vasantamala! See what is happening to me? How am I forced to roll on a
bed of burning coals of unbearable separation?" ||83|| Vasantamala said, "Oh,
goddess! Don't indulge in such inauspicious talk. I say with certainty that your
husband will come to you." ||84||

## The Ashtavasha Parva  **85.** "O Kalyani, I will bring your husband soon."
Thus, reassuring Anjana with great sorrow, King Prati-Surya, riding a beautiful,
swift chariot like the sun, ascended into the sky.   **86.** Looking down at the
earth, he went on his way, bowing his head in reverence.  **87.** The Vijayavasi
Vidyadharas and the Trikuta-dwelling Rakshasas, accompanied by Prati-Surya,
diligently surveyed the earth from the sky.  **48.** Then, in the forest called
Bhutarava, they saw a huge elephant, whose form resembled a monsoon cloud.
**89.** "This is the elephant called Kalamegha, belonging to Pavankumar," they
recognized him, having seen him many times before.  **90.** "This is the same
elephant," all the Vidyadharas exclaimed with joy, making a great noise.
**91.** "This elephant, whose color is like the Neelagiri or Anjanagiri, and
whose trunk is of the right proportion, is where Pavankumar must be.  **92.**
This elephant, like a friend, always stays by his side."  **93.** Saying this,
they approached the elephant, their minds trembling with fear, for he was
unrestrained.  **94.** The great elephant was disturbed by their loud noise. He
was unstoppable, his entire body was restless, and his speed was immense.
**95.** His cheeks were stained with musk, his ears were erect, and he roared
loudly. The Vidyadharas were terrified and fled in every direction he looked.
**96.** Seeing the crowd, the elephant, devoted to protecting his master, did
not leave Pavankumar's side.  **97.** He circled Pavankumar, playfully swinging
his trunk and terrifying all the Vidyadharas with his sharp tusks.  **98.** The
Vidyadharas, eager to subdue the elephant, surrounded him with female elephants.

In the Padma Purana, Among all the methods of subjugation, there is no other
superior to union with a woman. || 99 || Then the celestial beings saw Vayu,
whose limbs were trembling, whose form was like a painted figure, and who was
sitting in silence. || 100 || Although all the celestial beings treated him
appropriately, he remained immersed in thought like a sage, not speaking to
anyone. || 101 || His parents, filled with love for their son, smelled his head,
embraced him repeatedly, and their eyes were filled with tears of joy. || 102 ||
They said, "Son, why do you behave in such a way, abandoning your parents? You
were the foremost among the virtuous." || 103 || "Your body is worthy of a fine
bed, but why have you placed it in the hollow of a tree in this terrible and
desolate forest?" || 104 || Even when addressed in this way, he did not utter a
word. He simply indicated that he had decided to die. || 105 || "I have taken
this vow that I will not eat or speak until I obtain Anjana. How can I break
that vow now?" || 106 || "Let the matter of my beloved be forgotten. How can I
satisfy these parents while upholding my vow of truth?" He became anxious,
thinking this. || 107 || Then, seeing Vayu, whose head was bowed and who was
sitting in silent contemplation, knowing that he was determined to die, the
celestial beings were filled with grief. || 108 || All the celestial beings,
whose hearts were deeply saddened and who were touching Vayu's body with their
sweat-soaked hands, began to lament with his parents. || 109 || Then, smiling,
Prati-Surya said to the celestial beings, "Do not be distressed. I will call
Vayu Kumar for you." || 110 || And embracing Vayu, he spoke to him in order:
"Kumar, listen, I will tell you everything that happened." || 111 || On the
beautiful mountain called Sandhyabhra, there arose a state of solitary knowledge
in the sage Ananga-Vichi, which caused disturbance among the Indras. || 112 || I
was going there at night, worshipping him with a lamp, when I heard a sound of
weeping, like the sound of women crying. || 113 ||

## The Eighteenth Chapter  "I heard a sound like the notes of a vina, a woman's
weeping." (113)   "I made that sound my target and went to the highest peak of
the mountain. There, in a cave called Paryanka, I saw Anjana." (114)  "Knowing
the reason for her exile, I comforted the young woman, who was weeping in
sorrow." (115)  "In that cave, she gave birth to a son with auspicious signs.
His radiance made the cave seem as if it were made of gold." (116)  "Hearing of
the birth of his daughter, Pavananjay was filled with joy. He quickly asked,
'What happened next? What happened next?'" (117)  "Pratibhanu said, 'After that,
Anjana's son, with his beautiful actions, was being placed in a chariot when he
fell into the mountain cave.'" (118)  "Hearing this, Pavananjay, along with his
army of celestial beings, was again filled with sorrow, crying out in despair."
(119)  "Pratibhanu said, 'Do not grieve. Listen to what happened. O Vayu, the
whole story will dispel your sorrow.'" (120)  "Pratibhanu continued, 'Then, with
cries of sorrow echoing through the directions, we descended and saw the
innocent child in the middle of the mountain.'" (121)  "The child had fallen and
shattered the mountain. We, in awe, praised him as 'Shreeshala.'" (122)  "Then,
I took Anjana, along with her son, in a chariot and brought her to my city."
(123)  "Since he was raised in the island of Hanuruh, he was given the second
name Hanuman." (124)  "So, you should know that the woman you spoke of, Anjana,
with her son who performs wondrous deeds, resides in my city." (125)  "Then, the
joyful celestial beings, eager to see Anjana, quickly went to the city of
Hanuruh, with Vayu leading the way." (126)  "There, a great festival was held
for the reunion of Anjana and Pavananjay. The joy of the couple was palpable,
especially for them, it was indescribable." (127)  "The celestial beings spent
two months there, filled with joy. After receiving their due respect, they
returned to their respective places." (128)

In the Padma Purana, Even though the wind god, having obtained a wife after a
long time, was well-behaved, he was delighted by the deeds of his son, like the
sage Vyasa. || 129 || Hanuman, having attained the peak of youthful glory there,
stole the hearts of all, and his body shone like the peak of Mount Meru. || 130
|| He was a master of all knowledge, possessed immense power, was humble, and
skilled in the meaning of all scriptures. He was generous in helping others, and
he enjoyed the remaining merit from his heavenly pleasures. He delighted in that
city, being devoted to the worship of his teachers. || 131-132 || The
Shardulavikridita 410 Whoever, with the same love as the wind god, listens to
this union of Anjana and Vayu, which is filled with various flavors and wonders,
will, by the knowledge of all the laws of the world, attain self-knowledge. His
mind will not be inclined towards evil deeds, but will be inclined towards the
good deeds he has begun. || 133 || He will obtain a long life, a beautiful body
free from disease, a mind that can comprehend the ultimate subjects of all
scriptures, fame as pure as the moon, the ability to enjoy heavenly pleasures,
and all the rare things in the world. He will obtain all this as easily as the
sun obtains its radiant halo. || 134 || Thus ends the eighteenth chapter of the
Padma Purana, titled "The Union of Vayu and Anjana," narrated by the sage
Ravisha, as it is known in the tradition of the sages. || 18 || 0 Two months
passed. After that, everyone left, having received their due respect after
asking. || 128 || After a long time, having obtained a wife, the deeds of
Pavananjay also became proper, and he delighted in the deeds of his son, and he
began to roam there like the god Devaki. || 129 || Hanuman also, having obtained
the best youthful fortune there, began to steal the hearts of all, and his body
shone like the peak of Mount Meru. || 130 || He had mastered all knowledge, his
influence was unique, he was a knower of humility, he was mighty, he was skilled
in understanding the meaning of all scriptures, he was generous in helping
others, he was the enjoyer of the remaining merit from his heavenly pleasures,
and he was devoted to the worship of his teachers. In this way, he played with
great joy in that city. || 131-132 || Gautama Swami says to King Shrenik, "O
King! Whoever listens with devotion to this union of Anjana and Pavananjay,
which is filled with various flavors and wonders, will gain knowledge of all the
laws of the world. And by the influence of that knowledge, he will attain self-
knowledge, which will cause him to begin only good deeds, and his mind will not
be inclined towards evil deeds." || 133 || He will obtain a long life, a

The nineteenth chapter: Ravana, filled with unfulfilled rage, summoned all the
Vidyadharas again through letter carriers.  ||1|| The king of Kishkindha,
Dundubhi, the lord of Alankarapur, the master of Rathnapur, and all the other
Vidyadharas residing in both ranges of the Vijayarddha mountain, arrived at
Ravana's presence with all preparations. ||2-3||  After that, a man bearing a
mark on his forehead arrived at Hanuruh island, near Pavananjay and Prati-Surya.
||4|| Understanding the meaning of the letter, both decided to go to Ravana, but
before leaving, they were eager to perform the coronation of Hanuman on the
kingdom. ||5|| Great preparations were made for the coronation. The sound of
trumpets and other musical instruments echoed, and men stood before Hanuman with
kalashas in their hands. ||6|| Hanuman asked Pavananjay and Prati-Surya, "What
is this?" They replied, "O son! Now you rule the kingdom of Hanuruh island."
||7|| "Ravana has summoned us to assist him in the war, so we must obey his
command with love and as befits us." ||8|| "Varuna, who resides in Rasatalapur,
stands against him. His army is vast, and he is invincible due to the strength
of his sons and fortresses." ||9|| Hearing this, Hanuman humbly replied, "It is
not proper for you to go to war while I am here." ||10|| "O son! You have not
yet tasted the flavor of battle," they said. Hanuman replied, "What is
liberation, if it is not attained now?" ||11|| When he refused to stay despite

The Padma Purana states:  Having paid respects to his father, mother, and
maternal uncle, and having spoken to all, the learned Hanuman, mounted a chariot
that shone like the sun, and, encompassing the ten directions with a multitude
of weapons, proceeded towards Lanka.  Approaching Lanka, he was as resplendent
in his chariot as Indra, the king of the gods, is when he approaches Mount Meru.
As he reached the mountain of water-waves, the sun set, kissing the vast hips of
the ocean.  There, after spending the night in pleasant conversation with his
valiant companions, Hanuman, with great enthusiasm, set his gaze on Lanka and
continued his journey.  He saw various countries, islands, mountains, and
crocodiles churning the ocean, and he entered the army of the Rakshasas.  Seeing
Hanuman's army, the chieftains of the Rakshasas, with eyes fixed on the abode of
Sri Saila, were struck with utter amazement.  Hearing the words, "This is the
same glorious one who pulverized the mountain," Hanuman went to Ravana.  Seeing
Hanuman, who was adorned with flowers, whose buzzing, intoxicated bees were
attracted by the fragrance, and whose chariot was adorned with the radiance of
jewels, Ravana rose from his seat on the stone platform, where he was surrounded
by his ministers.  Embracing Hanuman, whose body was bent in humility, Ravana
sat down beside him, his face beaming with joy.  After inquiring about each
other's well-being and seeing each other's prosperity, the two fortunate ones,
like two Indras, reveled in their meeting.  Then, Ravana, whose mind was filled
with delight, and who was looking at Hanuman with eyes full of affection, said:
"Oh, how much my dear friend, the son of the wind, has increased my love by
sending this son, who is an ocean of renowned virtues!  Having obtained this
great being, adorned with a halo of brilliance, I have no fear of anything in
this vast world."

The Nineteenth Canto  413. While the qualities of Hanuman were being described,
Sri Saila, the lord of the mountain, became humble, like a bee that has been
satiated. This is the nature of the virtuous. ||29||  414. The sun, fearing the
impending battle, hastened to set, its rays tinged with a reddish hue. ||30||
415. Evening, carrying the crimson of passion, followed behind, adorned like a
virtuous wife following her beloved. ||31||  416. Then, the night, adorned with
the moon, shone brightly, following her husband, the sun, without ceasing.
||32||  417. The next day, when the world was illuminated by the sun's rays,
Dashagriva, fully armed, stood at the head of his army. ||33||  418. Hanuman,
standing nearby, adorned with auspicious symbols, had crossed the ocean by his
divine power and was approaching the city of Varuna. ||34||  419. As the sun,
aiming at Parashurama, shone with unparalleled brilliance, so too did Ravana,
approaching his enemy, radiate an unmatched light. ||35||  420. The sound of the
army alerted the city of Varuna to the arrival of Dashagriva, and the entire
city was shaken with fear and commotion. ||36||  421. The city of Varuna, known
as Patala-Pundarika, was adorned with strong banners and jeweled gates. But the
arrival of Ravana filled the city with the clamor of war preparations. ||37||
422. In that city, beautiful and captivating like the city of the Asuras, the
women were filled with fear, their eyes wide with terror. ||38||  423. The
warriors of the city, like the gods who dwell in their abodes, came out to
fight. Varuna, proud of his valor, emerged like the lord of the Asuras. ||39||
424. A hundred valiant sons of Varuna, who had blocked the sun's rays with their
weapons, also rose to fight. ||40||  425. Just as the Asura princes easily
defeat the lesser gods, so too did the hundred sons of Varuna quickly vanquish
the Rakshasa army. ||41||  426. The mighty warrior, whose body was enveloped in
a halo of brilliance, declared, "No task in this world will be too difficult for
me." ||28||  427. When Ravana was describing the qualities of Hanuman, he became
humble, like a bee that has been satiated. This is the nature of the great ones.
||29||  428. Then, the sun, whose rays were tinged with red, seemed to set, as
if fearing the impending battle. ||30||  429. Evening, carrying the crimson of

414 The army of Ravana, which had a hundred brothers displaying their skills,
was shattered by the army of Varuna. The army of Ravana scattered in fear like a
herd of cows. ||42|| The weapons of the Rakshasas, such as the chakra, bow,
mace, spear, and shataghni, fell from their hands, which were slippery with
sweat. ||43|| Seeing his army distressed by the shower of arrows, Ravana,
himself struck by the swift rain of arrows, became enraged. In a moment, he
broke through the enemy ranks and entered their midst, felling the heroes of
Varuna's army like a mighty elephant uproots trees. ||44-45|| Then, the hundred
sons of Varuna surrounded Ravana, like thunderous clouds encircling the sun
during the rainy season. ||46|| Though his body was pierced by arrows coming
from all directions, the proud lion of a man, Ravana, did not abandon the
battlefield. ||47|| On the other side, Varuna had arrayed against him the best
of men, the one with radiant ears, Indrajit, and other lords of the Rakshasas.
||48|| Seeing Ravana, who was marked by the arrows of Varuna's sons and whose
body was stained with blood, resembling a cluster of Palasha flowers, Hanuman
quickly mounted his chariot, which moved among the great men. His heart was
filled with affection for Ravana, as if he were his brother, and he shone like
the sun. ||49-50|| Then, Hanuman, who surpassed the wind in speed, who was
revered for his victories, and who shone like the sun, prepared to fight like
Yama himself. ||51|| Just as a group of high clouds, driven by a mighty wind,
scatters in all directions, so too, the sons of Varuna, driven by Hanuman, fled
in all directions. ||52|| He repeatedly engaged in the sport of cutting through
the Kadali forest with the bodies of his enemies, that is, he effortlessly cut
through the bodies of his enemies, who were like Kadali trees. ||53|| Just as a
man pulls his friend out of affection, so too, he pulled a hero with a noose
made of a Vidya-created Langul. ||54||

## The Nineteenth Chapter  **415** Just as someone strikes the head of a deluded
person with a hammer, so too was he being struck on the head by a falling
meteorite. **55** Seeing him playing, Sri Saila, adorned with the banner of the
monkey, approached with eyes red with anger. **56** Seeing Varuna approaching
Sri Saila, the king of the Rakshasas, ran and blocked him like a mountain
blocking the flow of a river. **57** The battle between Varuna and the Rakshasas
raged, filled with horses, elephants, foot soldiers, and a multitude of weapons.
**58** Meanwhile, the son of the wind, Hanuman, had bound a hundred of Varuna's
sons. They were exhausted from the long battle, and their army was decimated.
**59** Hearing that his hundred sons were bound, Varuna was overwhelmed with
grief. He forgot his knowledge and his strength faltered. **60** Seizing this
opportunity, the master of battle, Ravana, pierced through Varuna's knowledge
called "Yogini" and captured him alive. **61** At that time, Ravana acted as
Rahu to the moon, Varuna, whose radiance was lost due to the loss of his sons
and who was devoid of his rising. **62** Varuna, who was trapped in a cage of
weapons, his pride broken, was entrusted to the care of Kumbhakarna, who looked
at him with wonder. **63** After that, Ravana, relieved of his worries, gave his
army rest. He stayed in the excellent garden called "Bhavanonmad". **64** The
weariness of his army, which had taken shelter under the shade of trees, was
dispelled by the cool breeze from the sea. **65** Knowing that their leader was
captured, the entire army of Varuna, filled with fear and anxiety, entered the
city of Poundarika. **66** Although they were the same army and the same great
warriors, they became useless without their leader. **67** Oh, look at the
greatness of punya! When a virtuous person is born, many others rise with him,
and when he falls, many others fall with him. **68**   **Notes:**  * **Punya:**
Merit, virtue, good deeds. * **Yogini:** A type of knowledge or power. *
**Rahu:** A celestial being who is said to cause eclipses. * **Kumbhakarna:**
Ravana's brother, known for his immense size and sleep. * **Bhavanonmad:** A
garden, possibly named after a deity. * **Poundarika:** A city.

In the Padma Purana, it is said that Bhaskarakarna, the enemy, destroyed the
city, which was filled with a multitude of bewildered people.  ||65|| The
warriors looted all the wealth, jewels, and other valuables of the city. This
was done out of anger towards the enemy city, not out of greed. ||70|| The
women, who were filled with the delusion of love, with their eyes streaming with
tears, were being taken away, wailing. ||71|| Those women, whose bodies were
bent under the weight of their breasts, with their hands trembling like tender
leaves, were being taken away by the cruel men, crying out for their relatives.
||72|| One woman, who had been thrown inside the chariot, whose moon-like face
was eclipsed by the sorrow of the Rahu, spoke to her friend, her eyes filled
with tears. ||73|| "My friend, if my virtue is destroyed, I will surely die by
hanging myself from a cloth." ||74|| Another woman, whose death was uncertain,
was calling out to her beloved, again and again, her eyes dull with sorrow,
remembering his virtues. ||75|| Those women, whose eyes were streaming with
tears, were calling out to their mothers, fathers, husbands, brothers, uncles,
and sons, causing sorrow even to the sage. ||76|| One woman, whose eyes had
turned green due to the radiance of Kumbhakarna, spoke to her friend, who had
lotus-like eyes, in a secluded place. ||77|| "My friend, seeing this great man,
I have experienced an extraordinary joy, and my whole body feels like it has
become subservient to that joy." ||78|| Thus, due to the strange nature of
karma, both pure and impure thoughts arose in the minds of those women. Indeed,
the actions of people are strange. ||79|| Then, Kumbhakarna, who possessed
wealth like Kubera, who was served by valiant warriors, who was filled with the
sound of victory, and who was adorned with beautiful pastimes, descended from
his chariot and, with great joy, presented the captured women with their pale
lips to Ravana. ||80-81|| Those women were filled with sorrow, their eyes filled
with tears, and their bodies trembling. ||82||

They say that the nineteenth chapter is full of compassion, spontaneous, and
somewhat sorrowful. Ravana, filled with compassion, spoke to his brother. ||83||
Oh, this is a terrible deed you have done, my dear brother! You have brought
these noble women as prisoners. ||84|| What fault is there in these innocent
women, who are like precious jewels? Why have you brought them here in vain?
||85|| The duty of protecting the innocent, destroying the enemies, and serving
the teachers, is the duty of the great souls. ||86|| Saying this, he immediately
freed them, and they quickly returned to their homes. The virtuous women were
comforted by his words, and their fear quickly subsided. ||87|| Then Ravana
called Varuna, who was ashamed and whose face had turned pale at the sight of
the warriors. He said, "Do not grieve over being captured in battle, for the
capture of heroes in battle is a cause for their great fame." ||88-89|| A
valiant hero in battle obtains only two things: capture or death. Only cowards
flee. ||90|| You, as before, should protect your entire kingdom, with all your
friends and relatives, free from all troubles, in your own place. ||91|| Thus
addressed, Varuna folded his hands and said to the valiant Ravana, "In this
world, your virtue is vast. He who holds enmity towards you is a fool." ||92||
Oh, this great courage of yours is worthy of thousands of hymns, like that of a
sage. You have defeated me without using divine jewels. Truly, your rule is
exalted. ||93||

## Chapter 418 of the Padma Purana: The Story of Vayu's Son  How can the
influence of Vayu's son, the wonder-worker Hanuman, be described? For, O
virtuous one, he was also honored by your auspicious presence. ||94||  This
earth, protected by the treasury of valor, is not attainable by anyone through
lineage. It is meant for the enjoyment of the valiant, and you stand at the head
of the valiant, therefore, you should rule the world. ||95||  O lord of great
renown, you are our master. Forgive us for our harsh words. We speak because it
is necessary to speak, O lord, your boundless forgiveness is already evident.
||96||  By forming a bond with you, O one of great effort, I have achieved my
purpose. Therefore, accept my daughter, for you are the most worthy of her.
||97||  Saying this, he offered his daughter, born to the queen Sudevi, a
beautiful maiden with a lotus-like face, known as Satyavati, to Ravana. ||98||
A grand celebration took place at their wedding, honoring all the people. For
both of them possessed all prosperity, and there was nothing left for them to
seek. ||99||  Thus, honored by Ravana, who himself had honored him, and having
followed him, Vayu entered his own capital. There, for some days, his heart was
filled with sorrow due to the separation from his daughter. ||100||  Ravana, who
shook Mount Kailasa, also came to Lanka and, with great honor, gave his
daughter, Chandra-nakha's beautiful daughter, to Hanuman. That daughter was
known throughout the world as Anangapushpa, the queen of virtues. Her eyes were
like the flower-shaped weapon of Kamadeva, the god of love. Obtaining her,
Hanuman was filled with great joy. ||102||

## The Nineteenth Chapter  **419**  **Vasantatilaka Vritta**  He acquired wealth
and was crowned in the city of Karnakundala, like Indra in the celestial realm,
he enjoyed the best of pleasures. ||10||  Similarly, Nala, the king of
Kishkupura, gave his renowned daughter, Harimalini, to Hanuman, who was
victorious in acquiring Lakshmi through his beauty. ||104||  In the city of
Kinnaragita, he obtained a hundred daughters of the Kinnara race. Thus, the
great one had more than a thousand wives in succession. ||105||  **Upjati
Vritta**  Hanuman, who was known as Shrishaila, wandered and stayed on that
mountain. Thus, the beautiful peak became known as Shrishaila throughout the
earth. ||106||  At that time, in the city of Kishkindha, resided the noble
Sugriva, the king of the Vidhyadharas. His wife, Tara, was like the moon in her
face and resembled Rati in her beauty. ||107||  They had a daughter named Padma
raga, whose complexion was like a fresh lotus. She was renowned throughout the
earth for her virtues and resembled Lakshmi in her beauty. Her eyes were large,
her lotus-like face was adorned with a cluster of radiance, her breasts were
high and full like the temples of a large elephant, her belly was slender like
the grip of Indra's thunderbolt, she moved like a beautiful lake, and she stole
the hearts of all men. ||108-109||  **Upendra Vajra Vritta**  Her parents,
thinking about a suitable match for their beautiful and charming daughter, could
not sleep at night, and during the day, their minds were scattered. ||110||
**Note:** The text mentions that Hanuman received not only a daughter but also a
coronation in the city of Karnakundala. This suggests that he was crowned as the
king of that city.

420 In the Padma Purana, the Vidyaadharas, led by Indrajit, whose lineage and
character were well-known, were depicted in paintings. These beautiful paintings
were shown to the daughter by her parents. ||111|| Looking at them in sequence,
the girl repeatedly narrowed her eyes. When she saw the painting of Hanuman, her
gaze was immediately drawn to it and remained fixed. She looked at him with
affection. ||112|| Seeing Hanuman in the painting, whose entire body was devoid
of any resemblance to others, the girl was struck by five unbearable arrows of
Kamadeva at the same time. ||113|| Seeing her affection for Hanuman, her wise
friend said, "Oh, girl! This is the son of Pavananjay, known as Shrishail."
||114|| "His qualities were known to you before, and his beauty is before your
eyes. Therefore, enjoy the pleasures of love with him and give your parents a
long sleep, that is, let them sleep peacefully." ||115|| "Oh, what a wonder!
Hanuman, even in a painting, has aroused passion in your heart." The girl,
blushing, struck her friend with a lotus flower. ||116|| When the father learned
that his daughter's heart had been stolen by the son of Marut, he immediately
sent her painting to Hanuman. ||117|| The messenger sent by Sugriva reached
Shreenagar. There, he introduced himself, paid his respects, and then showed
Hanuman the painting of Padma raga, the daughter of Tara. ||118|| 1. Looking at

## The Nineteenth Chapter  It is said in this world that the god of love has
five arrows. If this is true, then how did the daughter of the king wound
Hanuman with a hundred arrows at once?  || 119 ||  Thinking, "My birth is in
vain if I do not obtain this maiden," Hanuman, endowed with great wealth, went
to Sugriva's city in an instant. || 120 ||  Hearing of his approach, King
Sugriva, overjoyed, immediately went out to greet him. Then, Hanuman, who had
been honored with hundreds of offerings, entered the city with his father-in-
law. || 121 ||  At that time, as Hanuman was going towards the royal palace, the
women of the city, abandoning all other tasks, went to the jewel-studded windows
of the palaces. Their lotus-like eyes were filled with longing to see him. ||
122 ||  Padmaraga, the daughter of Sugriva, with her delicate body, gazed from
the window at Hanuman's form. In her mind, she experienced a state beyond
description. || 123 ||  "This is not the same man, this is someone else," or
"No, friend, this is the same one," the women debated amongst themselves. Thus,
Hanuman entered Sugriva's city. || 124 ||  Their marriage was celebrated with
great splendor, with all their relatives present. The two, adorned with
beautiful forms, attained supreme joy through their harmonious union. || 125 ||
Hanuman, his mind at peace, returned to his own place, taking his wife with him.
He left his father-in-law and mother-in-law filled with sorrow, due to the
separation from their daughter and their own separation from her. || 126 ||
With such a glorious son, whose fame spread throughout the world, King Pavana
and Anjana, immersed in the ocean of supreme bliss, reveled in their joy. || 127
||  **Notes:**  1.  "Kanya liyukt" should be "Kanya liyukt**a**" (daughter of
the king) 2.  "Swavargau" should be "Swavarg**a**" (his family)

Here’s the English translation of the provided text, while keeping the Sanskrit
words intact:  ---  422  In the Padmapurāṇa, revered like the Śrīśaila by the
king of Khecaras, hailed as one who holds great honor. The master of all
enemies, the lord of the three realms, is equal to Hari in his neck. ||128||
In the great city of Laṅkā, the lord, renowned for his vast splendor, enjoyed
happiness with the pleasures of the earth. Just as the lord of gods provides
fulfillment to the entire world, so did he, like the Surendra in the celestial
abode. ||129||  A great personage, his hands red like the lotus, and who is
adored by the women of pleasure. He did not realize the long passage of time
like a bumblebee delighted by a beloved face. ||130||  If a man had a single
wife who was deformed and constantly quarreling, he still engages in sensual
pleasures, thinking himself the lord of desires while situated in worldly
happiness. ||131||  What to say of that king, who possessed great power, was
adorned with the beauty of eighteen thousand women, the lord of three realms,
and was matchless in his splendor? ||132||  Thus, surrounded by all the
celestial beings, whom people revered with lowered heads in fear, and who was
ceremoniously anointed as the ruler of the three worlds, such was Rāvaṇa, who
attained that praised sovereignty. ||133||  Worshipped by all celestial beings,
whose body was enchanting with the qualities of glory and beauty, he was like
the moon, captivating the hearts of all. ||134||  His discus, known as
Sudarśana, was divine and faultless, shining like the midday sun, adept at
annihilating hostile kings, and stood out brilliantly, adorned with various
celestial gems. ||135||  The intense energy emanating from him was terrifying,
like the dreadful death that grips the bodies of wicked souls, while he was
praised and honored in the abode of weapons. ||136||  Now, great Hanumāna, the
supreme king of the celestial beings, was honored by all for his great virtues.

## The Nineteenth Chapter  **423**  Thus, Ravana, due to his own karmic actions,
inherited the kingdom of Lanka, a lineage passed down through generations. He
possessed extraordinary wealth and happiness, a protector of the Rakshasas, and
enjoyed the highest worldly pleasures. **(137)**  The Muni Suvrata Tirtha, the
place of attaining Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct, has long
passed. Yet, those who are far from the ultimate truth, those foolish poets,
have spoken of this great man in a different way in the world. **(138)**  Those
poets, enslaved by worldly desires, devoid of true knowledge, extremely cunning,
and constantly attached to sin, with their fabricated, harmful, and deceitful
writings, ensnare the innocent and simple-minded like a flock of deer. **(139)**
Therefore, O Shrenik, you who have understood the true nature of things, who
have destroyed the mire of false doctrines created by those with wrong views,
who shine brighter than the sun, and who are as vast as Lakshmi, worship the
jewel of the Jina's teachings, the one revered by Indra. **(140)**  Thus ends
the nineteenth chapter of the Padmacharita, narrated by the Acharya Ravishena,
which describes the kingdom of Ravana. **(19)**  Thus ends the first chapter,
the Vidhyadhara Kanda.

## The Twentieth Chapter  The learned Shrenik, with a humble heart and a clear
mind, having heard this, bowed down at the feet of the Ganadhara and said with
wonder, "O Lord! By your grace, I have come to know the origin of the eighth
Pratinarayana, and the difference between the monkey and demon lineages. Now, O
Lord, I wish to hear the story of the twenty-four Tirthankaras and the twelve
Chakravartis, along with their past lives, as it is the cause of purifying the
mind."  "And, O Lord, who was the eighth Balabhadra, famous throughout the
world, born in what lineage, and what were his deeds?"  "O great sage! I also
wish to know the names of their fathers and others. O Lord, you are worthy of
telling all this."  Thus addressed, the great-souled, expert in ultimate truth,
Ganadhara, pleased by the excellent question, spoke these words: "Listen,
Shrenik, I will tell you the story of the past lives of the Tirthankaras, which
destroys sin and is worshipped by the Indras."  "Rishabha, Ajita, Sambhava,
Abhinandan, Sumati, Padma Prabha, Supaikha, Chandra Prabha, Suvidhi
(Pushpadanta), Sheetal, Shreyans, Vasupujya, Vimala, Ananta, Dharma, Shanti,
Kunthu, Ara, Malli (Muni) Suvrata Nath, Nami, Nemi, Parshva, and Mahavira, these
are the names of the twenty-four Tirthankaras. Mahavira is the last Tirthankara,
and his reign continues even now."  "Now, I will describe their past-life
cities: the most excellent Pundarika, Susima, the very beautiful Kshema, and the
most excellent Ratna Sanchay Puri, shining with precious jewels, these four
cities were very excellent and well-organized. From Rishabha Deva to Vasupujya
Bhagavan, these were the capitals of the Tirthankaras in their past lives, three
by three. In these cities, there were always festivals."  "The past-life
capitals of the remaining twelve Tirthankaras were as follows: Sumahanagar,
Arishtpur, Sumadrika, Pundarika, Susima, Kshema, Vitashoka, Champa, Kaushambi,
1. Padma Nabha, 2. Prabhu, 3. Vimala Nath, 4. Mahan + Ara."

428 Padmapurana Parshva, the king of Nagas, was described as having the color of
unripe barley.  Padmagarbha was described as having the color of the inner
petals of a lotus.  He was the best among those who asked questions. ||64||
Vasupujya was described as having the color of the flower of the Kimshuka tree.
Munisuvrata, the Tirthankara, was described as having the color of the blue
mountain. ||65||  Jina, the best of the Yadavas, was described as having the
color of a peacock's neck.  The remaining Jinas were described as having the
color of molten gold. ||66|| Vasupujya, Mahavira, Malli, Parshva, and the best
of the Yadavas, were all described as having left their homes as princes.  The
other Tirthankaras accepted the kingdom and then took initiation. ||67||  These
Tirthankaras were all worshipped, praised, and bowed to by the lords of the gods
and the lords of the earth.  They all received the ultimate abhisheka on the
peak of Mount Meru. ||68||  These twenty-four Tirthankaras, who are the cause of
the attainment of all auspiciousness and who are the greatest wonders of the
three worlds, may they always protect you. ||69|| Then, King Shrenik said to
Gautam Swami, "O Ganadhar! Now, tell me the truth that purifies the mind, the
measure of the lifespan of these twenty-four Tirthankaras." ||70||  "And, O
Venerable One, I also want to know about the Tirthankara during whose time
Ramachandra was born." ||71|| When King Shrenik asked this question with great
respect, the Ganadhar Swami, whose mind was as pure as the ocean of milk, said,
||72|| "O Shrenik! The entity called time transcends the realm of numbers,
meaning it is infinite.  It cannot be perceived directly by the senses.
However, the great ones have described it using an analogy in their minds."
||73|| "Imagine a space the size of a yojana, surrounded on all sides by walls.
It is filled with the tips of the hairs of a sheep that was just born. ||74||
This space is made very hard by pounding it.  This space, which is one yojana
long, wide, and deep, is called a dravyapalya.  Since it has been said that this
is an analogy, then questions like who dug this pit, who filled it, etc., are
meaningless." ||75||

Jain Terms Preserved:  The 429th chapter describes the 'Ratnakaropama' time
period, which is the time period of the ten Avarsarpini (descending) cycles.
Each Avarsarpini and Utsarpini (ascending) cycle lasts for the same duration,
just like the waxing and waning phases of the moon. These cycles are divided
into six sub-periods by the Mahatmas (great beings) based on the differences in
the potency of the substances involved.  The first sub-period of the Avarsarpini
cycle is called Sushama-Sushama, whose time period is measured in 4 Koṭikodyās
of Sāgaropamas. The second sub-period is called Sushama, whose time period is 3
Koṭikodyās of Sāgaropamas. The third sub-period is called Sushama-Duhṣhama,
whose time period is 2 Koṭikodyās of Sāgaropamas. The fourth sub-period is
called Duhṣhama-Sushama, whose time period is 1 Koṭikodyā of Sāgaropamas minus
42,000 years. The fifth sub-period is called Duhṣhama, and the sixth sub-period
is called Duhṣhama-Duhṣhama, each of whose time periods is 21,000 years as per
the Jinas.  The time intervals between the Tīrthaṅkaras are then described.
After Bhagavān Ṛṣhabhadeva, the second Tīrthaṅkara Ajitanātha appeared after an
interval of 50 lakh Koṭikodyās of Sāgaropamas. The third Tīrthaṅkara
Sambhavanātha appeared after an interval of 30 lakh Koṭikodyās of Sāgaropamas.
The fourth Tīrthaṅkara Abhinandananātha appeared after an interval of 10 lakh
Koṭikodyās of Sāgaropamas. The subsequent Tīrthaṅkaras appeared at intervals of
9 lakh, 90,000, 9,000, 900, 90, and 9 Koṭikodyās of Sāgaropamas respectively.

## The Twentieth Chapter  **431**  By the roars of those who have released the
weapon of the scriptures, the Karma-Mlechchas, who are intoxicated with pride,
whose enthusiasm is born of evil, who are covered in the darkness of delusion,
**10**  the rulers of the non-noble, who are constantly engaged in violence,
will be cut down by the axe of the weapon of violence, due to the influence of
the slow time.  **101**  In the beginning of the fifth time, the height of
humans is said to be seven cubits, and then there will be a gradual decrease.
**102**  Then, in the sixth time, they will be twenty cubits tall, with a
lifespan of twenty years. After that, they will be one cubit tall, with a
lifespan of sixteen years.  **103**  They will live like reptiles, earning their
livelihood with great difficulty.  **104**  They will have deformed bodies,
constantly engaged in sinful activities, tormented by delusion and disease, like
animals.  **105**  There will be no order, no connection, no rulers, no
servants. There will be no wealth, no homes, and no happiness, only misery.
**106**  Driven by the pursuit of pleasure, wealth, and dharma, the people will
be empty, like piles of sin.  **107**  Just as the moon wanes in the dark
fortnight and waxes in the bright fortnight, so too, in the Avasarpini time,
there is a decrease in the lifespan and other qualities of people, and in the
Utsarpini time, there is an increase.  **108**  Or, just as the activities of
festivals and other good deeds decrease at night and increase during the day, so
too, one should understand the state of the Avasarpini and Utsarpini times.
**109**  The decrease that has been described in the Avasarpini time should be
understood as an increase in the Utsarpini time.  **110**  Gautama Swami said to
King Shrenik, "O King! I have spoken of the difference between the twenty-four
Tirthankaras. Now, I will speak of their heights in order. Listen carefully."
**111**  The height of the first Tirthankara, Rishabhadeva, is said to be five
hundred bows.  **112**

The Twentieth Chapter 433 One thousand years and seventy-two years are mentioned
as the lifespan of the twenty-fourth Tirthankara, Mahavira.   The lifespans of
the Tirthankaras are mentioned in order. Listen now to the details of the
Chakravartis who were born in between the Tirthankaras.  The first Chakravarti,
Bharat, was born to King Rishabhadeva and Queen Yashovati. This Chakravarti's
name made this region known as Bharat in all three worlds.  This Bharat was a
prince named Pitha in the city of  Pundarika in his previous birth. He attained
Sarvarthasiddhi after becoming a disciple of Kushasen Muni. After that, he
became the Chakravarti Bharat. He was constantly filled with dispassion, and
after shedding his hair and nails, he attained Kevala Jnana and reached Nirvana.
The second Chakravarti, Sagar, was born in the city of Prithvipur. He was a
disciple of the Muni Yashodhar. After attaining the highest state of liberation,
he was reborn in Ayodhya as the son of King Vijay and Queen Sumangala. He was so
powerful that even the gods respected his commands. He enjoyed the highest
pleasures and then, due to the grief of losing his sons, he renounced the world
and took the Jain initiation. He attained Kevala Jnana and reached Siddhalaya.
The third Chakravarti, Maghava, was born in the city of Shravasti. He was the
son of King Sumitra and Queen Bhadravati. He was a disciple of the Muni Vimala
in the city of Pundarika. He enjoyed the highest pleasures of the world in the
city of Greveyak. He was a tree for the creeper of Lakshmi, the goddess of
wealth. He was born between the Tirthankaras Dharmanatha and Shantiantha. He
took the vows of a monk and was born in the Saudharma heaven according to his
meditation.  After this, the fourth Chakravarti, Sanatkumar, was praised by
Gautam Swami. King Shrenik asked, "O Bhagavan, by what virtue did he become so
beautiful?"  The lifespans of the Tirthankaras were: Aranatha - 84,000 years,
Naminatha - 10,000 years,  Mallinatha - 55,000 years,  Muni Suvrata - 30,000
years,  Neminatha - 1,000 years,  Parshvanatha - 100 years, and Mahavira - 72
years.  O Shrenik, I have thus described the lifespans of the Tirthankaras in
order. Now listen to the details of the Chakravartis who were born in between
the Tirthankaras.

In the Padma Purana, the great sage narrated the essence of the Purana, saying
that even a hundred years would not be enough to tell it all. (135) He said that
until a being attains Jainism, it continues to suffer in the animal realms,
hell, and the human realm. (136) Describing the past life, he said that there
was a village called Govardhana, full of people, where a great householder named
Jinadatta lived. (137) Just as the ocean is the chief among all water bodies,
Mount Meru with its beautiful caves is the chief among all mountains, the sun is
the chief among all planets, sugarcane is the chief among all grasses, the
Nagavalli is the chief among all creepers, and the sandalwood tree is the chief
among all trees, so too, the lineage of the Shravakas is the chief among all
lineages, for it is purified by conduct and dedicated to attaining the best
path. (138-140) That householder, born into the lineage of Shravakas, followed
the conduct of a Shravaka, adorned with virtues, and attained the best path.
(141) His wife, Vinayavati, was a devoted wife, dedicated to the dharma of
householders, and was very sad at the loss of her husband. (142) She built a
magnificent temple for the Jina in her home and, after taking the vows of an
Aryika, attained the divine path through her excellent austerities. (143) In the
same city, there lived a great householder named Hemabahu, who was a believer,
very enthusiastic, and averse to evil conduct. (144) Vinayavati, who had built
the Jain temple and performed great worship there, received his approval and, at
the end of his life, became a Yaksha deity. (145) That Yaksha was always
dedicated to the service of the fourfold sangha, possessed right faith, and was
always dedicated to the worship of the Jina. (146) From there, he became a noble
human, then a deity. Thus, he went through three transformations of human and
divine paths and became a king named Dharma-ruchi in the great city of Maha-
puri. This Dharma-ruchi was born from the heavens, being the son of Sanatkumara.
His father's name was Suprabha and his mother's name was Tilakasundari.
Tilakasundari was like a treasure chest of the virtues of excellent women.
(147-148) King Dharma-ruchi became a disciple of the sage Suprabha and became a
charaka, observing the five great vows, the five samitis, and the three guptis.

The Twentieth Chapter  He was always devoted to self-criticism, patient in
enduring afflictions, completely detached from his body, compassionate, self-
controlled, wise, a bearer of the burden of virtue, far removed from the eight
defects of right faith, and constantly engaged in the proper conduct of the
virtuous. ||150-151|| At the end of his lifespan, he was born in the Mahendra
heaven and, residing amidst a group of goddesses, attained supreme enjoyments.
||152|| Subsequently, he was born in Hastinapur as the fourth Chakravarti, named
Sanatkumar, to King Vijay and Queen Sahadevi. ||153||  Once, in his assembly,
Saudharmendra praised the form of Sanatkumar Chakravarti in the course of a
narrative. Some gods came to see his form, which was a cause of wonder. ||154||
When those gods secretly observed him, he had just finished his exercise, his
body's radiance was obscured by the dust of the arena, his head was smeared with
fragrant gooseberry paste, his body was very tall, he was wearing a single
garment suitable for bathing, he was seated on a seat suitable for bathing, and
he was situated amidst a circle of pitchers filled with fragrant water of
various colors. ||155-156|| Seeing him, the gods said, "Oh! Indra has rightly
praised his form. Even though he is a human, his form is a cause of attraction
for the minds of the gods." ||157|| When Sanatkumar learned that the gods wanted
to see his form, he said to them, "Please stay here for a while. Let me bathe,
eat, and adorn myself, then you can see me." ||158|| "So be it," said the
Chakravarti Sanatkumar, and after performing all his duties properly, he sat on
his throne. At that time, he appeared like the peak of a mountain made of
jewels. ||159||  Thereafter, seeing his form again, the gods began to criticize
each other, saying, "The beauty of humans is worthless and fleeting, so it is to
be condemned." ||160|| How is it that the beauty that we saw in his youth at the
first glance, like lightning, has become fleeting and decayed in an instant?
||161|| Knowing that Lakshmi is fleeting, Chakravarti Sanatkumar, free from
attachment to the gods, attained the state of a Shraman, adorned with intense
austerities. ||162||

## English Translation:  **436** **Padma Purana**  **163.**  Even though he was
afflicted with many severe illnesses, he endured them with great peace. He
attained many Siddhis through his austerities. Finally, through the power of his
meditation, he became a Deva in the Sanatkumara heaven.  **164-165.** Now, the
description of the fifth Chakravarti. King Megha Rath lived in the city of
Pundarikin. He was a disciple of his father, the Tirthankara Dhanarath, and
attained Sarvarth Siddhi. From there, he was born as a son of King Vishvasen and
Queen Airadevi in Hastinapur. He was known as Shanti Nath, a renowned son who
brought peace to mankind.  **166.**  As soon as he was born, the Devas performed
his coronation on Mount Sumeru. Indra praised him, and thus he became the master
of the enjoyments of a Chakravarti.  **167.** He was the fifth Chakravarti and
the sixteenth Tirthankara. Finally, he renounced his kingdom, which was like a
blade of grass, and took Diksha.  **168.** After him, Kunth Nath and Ar Nath
became the sixth and seventh Chakravartis respectively. They had accumulated the
sixteen Karana Bhavanas in their previous births, and therefore attained the
Tirthankarahood.  **169.** Sanatkumara, the fourth Chakravarti, lived between
the Tirthankaras Dharmanath and Shanti Nath. One should know that the time
difference between these three Tirthankaras and Chakravartis is their own
individual time.  **170.** Now, the description of the eighth Chakravarti. King
Kanakabh lived in the city of Dhanyapur. He was a disciple of the Muni,
Vichitragupta, and was born in the Uttara Vimana as Jayant.  **171-172.** From
there, he was born as the eighth Chakravarti, Subhum, in the city of Ishavati,
to King Kartavirya and Queen Tara. He was a possessor of excellent virtues and
made the earth excellent. Therefore, his name Subhum was meaningful.  **173.**
In a battle, Parashuram had killed his father. So, he killed Parashuram.
Parashuram had killed the Kshatriyas and collected their teeth. A Nitijnanee
told him that the one who would see these teeth transformed into Kheer would be
the cause of his death. Subhum went to Parashuram's Yajna. When he was about to
eat, Parashuram showed him all the teeth in a vessel.  **174.** Due to the power
of his punya, the teeth turned into Kheer, and the vessel transformed into a
Chakra. Subhum ate the Kheer.

## The Twentieth Chapter  437  **175.** It is said that the earth was filled
with enemies of the Kshatriyas for seven cycles. He who made the earth devoid of
Kshatriyas for twenty-one cycles,   **176.** Due to his extremely strict rule,
the Brahmanas, obtaining great fear, hid themselves in the families of
washermen, etc., like the Kshatriyas.  **177.** This Chakravarti, named Subhūm,
lived between Aranāth and Mallināth. He was not detached from worldly pleasures
and therefore went to the seventh hell after death.  **178.** Now we describe
the ninth Chakravarti. In the city of Vītashoka, there was a king named Chinta.
He became a disciple of Suprabhamuni and attained Brahma heaven.  **179.** From
there, he was born as the ninth Chakravarti, named Mahapadmin, in Hastinapur, to
King Padmaratha and Queen Mayuri.  **180.** He had eight daughters who were
proud of their beauty and did not desire any husband on earth. Once, the
Vidyadharas took them away.  **181.** After finding them, the Chakravarti
brought them back, but they, being detached, took initiation and attained heaven
after achieving self-liberation.  **182.** The eight Vidyadharas who had taken
them away also became initiated due to their separation and fear of the
unpredictable nature of the world.  **183.** This incident made the Chakravarti,
who possessed great virtues, realize the truth. He left his kingdom for his son,
Padma, and went with his son, Vishnu, to become a monk.  **184.** Mahapadmin,
after performing intense austerities, attained Kevala Jnana and finally reached
the peak of the universe. This Chakravarti lived between Aranāth and Mallināth.
**185.** Now we describe the tenth Chakravarti. In the city of Vijay, there
lived a king named Mahendradatta. He became a disciple of Nandan Muni and was
born in Mahendra heaven.  **186.** From there, he was born as the tenth
Chakravarti, named Harishena, in Kampilya, to King Hariketu and Queen Vaprā.
**187.** He adorned his entire kingdom with Jina images and attained Siddha-pada
in the Tirtha of Muni Suvrata Nath.

438 In the Padma Purana, there was a king named Amitanka in the city of
Rajapura. He became a disciple of Sudharma Mitra and went to Brahmaloka. ||18||
From there, he was born as Vijay in the same city of Kampilya, to queen
Yashovati. He was known as Jayasen, the ruler with the wheel-kissed edict.
||189|| Abandoning his great kingdom, he took the Digambara initiation and
worshipped the Triratna, attaining the Siddha state. ||190|| This happened
between the times of Munisuvratnath and Naminath.  Now, we describe the twelfth
Chakravarti.  In the city of Kashi, there was a king named Sambhuta. He became a
disciple of the Muni named Svatantralinga and was born in a Vimana called
Kamalagulma. ||191|| From there, he was born as Brahmadutta, the twelfth
Chakravarti, in the city of Kampilya, to king Brahmaratha and queen Chula.
||192|| This Chakravarti enjoyed Lakshmi but did not renounce her, and in that
unrestrained state, he died and went to the seventh hell. This happened between
the times of Neminath and Parshvanath. ||193||  Gautamswami tells king Shrenik,
"O king of Magadha! Thus, I have described the six-section rulers, the
Chakravartis. They were so powerful that even the gods and demons could not stop
their progress." ||194|| "I have spoken of the fruits of virtue and vice
directly. Why do people not do the right thing after hearing, experiencing, and
seeing it?" ||195|| "Just as a traveler does not go to another village without
taking food like appu, so too, this being does not go to another world without
the food of virtue and vice." ||196|| "Those who dwell in excellent mansions,
filled with the best women and as high as Mount Kailasa, are the fruit of the
tree of virtue." ||197|| "And those who are immersed in the mud of poverty,
dwelling in crooked houses with the hardships of cold, heat, and wind, are the
fruit of the tree of vice." ||198|| "Those kings and emperors who ride on
elephants as tall as the peak of Vindhyachala, with fly whisks waving over them,
are the fruit of the virtuous paddy." ||199|| "Those who ride on beautiful
horses with fly whisks waving on either side, and who have a beautiful body, are
the result of the virtuous king's actions." ||200||  Now, we describe the
eleventh Chakravarti.

## The Twentieth Chapter  **A stream of sweet nectar flows from the mountain of
merit, as the devotees ascend the chariot resembling a celestial palace.** (20)
**Those who wander with their feet covered in dirt, their steps unsteady, are
the fruits of the tree of sin, poisoned by evil.** (202)  **The food that is
consumed like nectar in golden vessels is the effect of the Dharma-rasa, as
declared by the great sages.** (203)  **The attainment of the position of Indra,
the Chakravarti, and the ordinary king, by the noble souls, is the fruit of the
vine of non-violence.** (204)  **The wealth attained by Rama and Keshava, O
श्रेणिक, is also the fruit of Dharma. Now, I shall speak of Rama and Keshava.**
(205)  **First, listen to the names of the nine cities associated with the
previous births of the nine Narayanas in the Bharata region: 1. The beautiful
Hastinapur, 2. Ayodhya adorned with flags, 3. The vast Shravasti, 4. Kaushambi
adorned with a clear sky, 5. Podanpur, 6. Shailanagar, 7. Singhapur, 8.
Kaushambi, and 9. Hastinapur. These nine cities are mentioned in order. All
these cities were filled with all kinds of wealth and grain, free from fear, and
adorned with the residences of the Vasudevas, i.e., Narayanas, in their previous
births.** (206-208)  **Now, listen to the names of these Vasudevas in their
previous births: 1. The mighty Vishvanandi, 2. Parvata, 3. Dhanamitra, 4.
Sagardatta, who, having attained the position of a king, made a sound like the
ocean, 5. Vikata, 6. Priyamitra, 7. Manasacheshtita, 8. Punarvasu, and 9.
Gangadeva. These are the names of the Narayanas in their previous births.**
(209-211)  **In their previous births, they were all extremely deformed and
unfortunate. They became monks due to the following reasons: 1. Loss of capital,
2. Defeat in battle, 3. Abduction of a woman, 4. Playing in gardens and forests,
5. Desire for forest games, 6. Extreme attachment to worldly pleasures, 7.
Separation from loved ones, 8. Fire disaster, and 9. Misfortune. They practiced
austerities with the desire for future enjoyments, and were devoid of true
knowledge. After death, they became Narayanas. All these Narayanas are younger
brothers of Balabhadra.** (212-214)  **O श्रेणिक! The desire for future
enjoyments should be avoided with great effort, as it is the cause of great
suffering and a harsh teacher.** (215)

## Padmapurana: Translation with Jain Terms  **Verse 216:** Sambhuta, the
embodiment of austerity, is known as Subhadra, Vasudarsana, Shreyans, Subhuti,
Vasubhuti.  **Verse 217:**  Ghosha, Sena, Parambhodi, and  Drumasen are the
great Munis, the gurus of the Krishnas in their previous birth.  **Verse 218:**
The Kalpas (epochs) are named Maha-Shukra, Pranata, Lantava, Sahasrar, Brahma,
and Mahendra.  **Verse 219:**  The Kalpas are also known as Soudharma, the abode
of those who strive for truth, and Sanatkumara, another Maha-Shukra.  **Verse
220:**  These beings, having attained the fruits of their good deeds, descended
from these heavens and, due to the residue of their merit, were born as the
Vasudeva kings.  **Verse 221:**  Their birthplaces are Podan, Dwapuri,
Hastinapur, Chakrpur, Kushagra, Mithilapuri, Ayodhya, and Mathura.  **Verse
222:**  These cities were filled with wealth and constantly bustling with
festivals.  **Verse 223:**  The fathers of the Krishnas are Prajapati,
Brahmabhuti, Raudra-nada, Soma,  Prakhyata, Shiva-kara, Sama-murdhagni-nada,
Dasharatha, and Vasudeva.  **Verse 224:**  The mothers of the Krishnas are
Mrigavati, Madhavi, Prithvi, Sita, Ambika, Lakshmi, Kesini, Kaikeyi, and Devaki.
**Verse 225:**  These mothers were blessed with great fortune and possessed
beautiful forms.  **Verse 226:**  The queens of the Krishnas are  Suprabha,
Rupini, Prabhava, Manohara, Sunetra, Vimala-sundari, Anandavati, Prabhavati, and
Rukmini.  **Verse 227:**  These queens are known as the Mahadevi (great
goddesses) of the Krishnas.  **Verse 228:**  One should abandon the practice of
austerity with great effort, as it is capable of causing immense suffering in
the future.  **Note:** The names of the nine Narayanas are missing in the
manuscript and printed copies, but they are essential. Pandit Daulatramji has
also translated them. Therefore, the text within the brackets [ ] has been added
to the translation for the sake of consistency.

## Translation:  **442** In the Padma Purana, the city of Lankapura, along with
other cities, were known to be the abodes of the Pratichक्रिणs. These cities
were illuminated by the rays of jewels. ||243||  **444** The names of the nine
Pratichक्रिणs of the Vasudevas are as follows: Ashwagriva, Taraka, Meraka,
Madhukaitabha, Nishumbha, Bali, Prahlada, Dashanana, and Jarasandha. ||244-245||
**446** The names of the Gurus of the Balabhadra are: Suvarna Kumbha, Satkirti,
Sudharma, Mriganka, Shruti Kirti, Sumit, Bhavanashruta, Suvrata, and
Susiddhartha. All of them were enveloped in the glory born from the burden of
their austerities. ||246-247||  **448** Eight of the nine Balabhadra, having
attained the glory of Balabhadra, became indifferent to the world and burned the
forest of karma. They attained Nirvana, where they were free from the torment of
various diseases, which were like animals roaming in the forest. This forest was
terrifying, with the tiger of death and the huge, tall trees of birth being cut
down. The last Balabhadra, due to the remaining karma-bondage, attained the
Brahma heaven. ||248||  **449** Gautama Ganadhara tells King Shrenik, "O King! I
have told you the story of the Tirthankaras, the Chakravartis who conquered the
Bharat Kshetra, the Narayanas, and the Balabhadra. This story is full of wonder,
starting from their previous births. Some of them, after performing great
austerities, attain liberation from this world. Some have a few remaining sinful
karmas and wander in the world for a short time before attaining liberation.
Some, due to the strong power of their karmas, wander in the dense cycle of
birth and death for a long time." ||249||  **Note:** The numbers in the text

443 Knowing this twenty-first **Parva**, which is strange, the beings of the
world, engulfed in the great ocean of the **Kalikaluṣa** (the pollution of the
Kali Yuga), are burning in the great suffering of the **Nīcagatī** (lower
realms) like fire. Knowing this, some **Bhavyas** (future Jinas) do not even
desire this world. Some want to make the acquaintance of **Puṇya** (merit), and
some, like the sun, end their **Moha** (delusion) and attain pure
**Kevalajñāna** (omniscience). ||25|| Thus ends the twenty-first **Parva**
called **Tīrthankara Bhavanukīrtana** (the narration of the births of the
Tīrthankaras) in the **Padmacarita** (the story of the lotus) narrated by
**Raviṣeṇa Ācārya**, known as **Ārya**. ||20|| 1. **Prāṇajāta** m.

## The Twenty-First Chapter  I tell you the story of the connection of the
eighth Balabhadra with Sri Rama. Listen to the lineage of some great men. ||1||
After the tenth Tirthankara, Sri Shitalnath Bhagwan attained liberation, a king
named Sumukh ruled in Kaushambi. At the same time, a wealthy merchant named
Veerak lived in the same city. ||2||  The king, Sumukh, abducted Veerak's wife,
Vanamala, and enjoyed her company as he desired. Finally, he gave donations to
the ascetics and went to Mount Rukmagiri. ||3||  There, in the southern part of
Mount Rukmagiri, there was a city called Haripur. In this city, a couple was
born, a Vidhyadhar and a Vidhyadhari. They enjoyed the pleasures of the material
world. ||4||  Veerak, whose body was burning with the fire of separation from
his beloved, attained the status of a god, surrounded by many goddesses, through
his penance. ||5||  With his knowledge of the past, the god knew that his enemy,
King Sumukh, was born in Harikshetra. Driven by his evil mind, he brought Sumukh
from Harikshetra to Bharatkshetra and caused his downfall. ||6||  Since he was
brought from Harikshetra with his wife, he became known as Hari throughout the
world. ||7||  He had a son named Mahagir, who had a son named Himagiri. Himagiri
had a son named Vasugiri, who had a son named Indragiri. Indragiri had a son
named Ratnamala, who had a son named Sambhut, who had a son named Bhootdev. In
this way, hundreds of kings, all descendants of Hari, were born. ||8-9||  Later,
in the same lineage, a famous and excellent king named Sumit, was born in the
great city of Kushagra. ||10||  This king was equal to Indra in his enjoyment,
he conquered the moon with his brilliance, he conquered the sun with his
radiance, and he defeated his enemies with his power. ||11||

## The Twenty-First Chapter  Padmavati, the wife of Padma-netra, was a woman of
great beauty. Her eyes were like lotuses, she was adorned with auspicious marks,
and all her desires were fulfilled. ||12||  One night, while sleeping on a
comfortable bed in her beautiful palace, she saw sixteen auspicious dreams in
the last watch of the night. ||13||  She dreamt of an elephant, two bulls, a
lion, the coronation of Lakshmi, two garlands, the moon, the sun, two fish, a
pot, a lotus-filled lake, the ocean, a throne adorned with jewels, an aerial
chariot, a bright palace, a heap of jewels, and fire. ||14-15||  Astonished and
bewildered, the wise queen Padmavati woke up and, after performing her morning
rituals, went to her husband with great humility. ||16||  With folded hands, she
asked her husband, the knower of justice, about the meaning of her dreams, while
sitting comfortably on a beautiful seat. ||17||  As her husband was explaining
the meaning of her dreams, a rain of jewels began to fall from the sky. ||18||
By the command of Indra, a happy Yaksha showered three and a half crore jewels
on her house every day. ||19||  For fifteen months, the continuous rain of
wealth transformed the entire city into a city of jewels and gold. ||20||  All
the goddesses, like Shri and Hri, who resided in the lotus ponds of Padma,
Mahapadma, etc., along with their families, served the mother of the Jina with
great respect. ||21||  Then, the Lord was born. As soon as he was born, Indra,
along with the Lokapalas, performed his abhisheka with the water of the ocean of
milk on Mount Meru with great splendor. ||22||  After the abhisheka, Indra
worshipped, praised, and prostrated before the Jina, and then lovingly placed
him in his mother's lap. ||23||  Since the time the Lord was in the womb, his
mother had become particularly devoted to good vows, hence he became known as
Muni-Suvrata. ||24||  Muni-Suvrata, whose face was like the full moon, conquered
the entire world with his radiant body and defeated all his enemies with his
prowess. ||25||

446 In the Padma Purana, it is said that the great Indra, adorned with the
finest pleasures, had rejected the immense happiness of the Indra-world from
afar. ||26|| Ha-ha, hoo-hoo, the celestial musicians like Tumburu, Narada, and
Vishvavasu, along with the Kinnara women and many Apsaras, sang and danced with
their veenas, flutes, and other instruments. Many goddesses bathed him, applying
fragrant pastes and other beauty treatments. ||27-28|| The Lord, with his
beautiful body, enjoyed the company of women in their youth, adorned with
charming smiles, shyness, pride, jealousy, grace, and other captivating
qualities, as he desired. ||29|| Seeing the clouds of the autumn season
dissolving, he was awakened to the desire for liberation. At that time, the
celestial beings praised him. ||30|| He then relinquished all desires and gave
his kingdom, where all the vassals were submissive and lived happily, to his
son, Suvrata. ||31|| Then, he emerged from the lotus-garden, his body fragrant
with divine unguents, attracting a multitude of eager bees with its sweet scent.
The garden was filled with green gem-like leaves, white lotus petals like rows
of teeth, the sounds of birds singing and ornaments jingling, waves of water,
and swan-like breasts. He emerged from this garden of beautiful women like a
swan from a lotus pond. ||32-35|| Then, the Lord Munisuvratanatha, the jewel of
humanity, mounted the Aparajita palanquin, carried by gods and kings, and went
to the vast garden called Vipula. ||36|| After descending from the palanquin,
the Lord Munisuvratanatha, the ornament of the Hari-dynasty, took Jain
initiation along with thousands of kings. ||37|| When the Lord took initiation,
he observed a two-day fast. After the fast, in the city of Rajagriha,
Vrishabhadatt, with devotion, gave him food for the breaking of the fast. ||38||

The twenty-first chapter describes how the Lord, for the sake of the practice of
the teachings and the enjoyment of the world, took food. Vrishabhadutta attained
the fivefold worship. ||39||  Then, while the Lord was seated in white
meditation under the Champaca tree, the final karma of the killer was destroyed,
and he attained Kevala Jnana. ||40||  Then, the gods, along with Indra, came
together, praised him, bowed down, and listened to the excellent Dharma from the
Muni Suvrata Nath, who was adorned with the excellent Ganadharas. ||41||  The
Lord explained the Dharma in many ways, with and without the possession of a
house. Having heard this pure Dharma, they all went to their respective places
as appropriate. ||42||  The Muni Suvrata Nath, who was praised by the gods and
demons, also established the Dharma Tirtha, and, filled with joy, he wandered
the earth with the great souls, the protectors of the Gan, and other virtuous
ones. ||43-44||  Then, he ascended to the peak of Sammed Shikhar, destroyed the
four types of karma, and became the jewel of the world, that is, he attained
Siddhalaya. ||45||  Those who read or hear this great story of Muni Suvrata
Nath, their sins are destroyed. ||46||  They attain enlightenment, purify the
three jewels, and attain the supreme state from which there is no return. ||47||
Then, Suvrata, the son of Muni Suvrata Nath, ruled his kingdom for a long time,
and then, after handing over the kingdom to his son Daksha, he renounced the
world and attained liberation. ||48||  Daksha had a son named Ilavardhana,
Ilavardhana had a son named Srivardhana, Srivardhana had a son named Srivrksha,
Srivrksha had a son named Sanjayanta, Sanjayanta had a son named Kunima, Kunima
had a son named Maharatha, and Maharatha had a son named Pulama. Thus, thousands
of kings were born in the Hari dynasty. Some of them attained liberation, and
some went to heaven. ||49-51||  In this way, after many kings had passed, a king
named Vasavaketu was born in this dynasty in Mithila. ||52||

The queen was named Vipula, meaning "abundant." She had large eyes and was a
possessor of great fortune, yet she was also afflicted with poverty in the
middle, meaning her waist was very thin.  ||53||  Their son was named Janaka,
meaning "father," and he was skilled in politics. Like a true father, he always
worked for the welfare of his people. ||54||  O King Shrenika, I have thus
described the birth of King Janaka to you. Now listen to the story of King
Dasharatha, who belonged to the Yadu dynasty. ||55||  In the glorious lineage of
the Ikshvaku, after the great Lord Rishabhadeva attained nirvana, and after the
emperors Bharat, Arka-kirti, and Soma, the ornament of the dynasty, had passed
away, countless years later, many kings arose in that lineage. Some of them
attained nirvana after performing extremely difficult austerities, some went to
heaven and indulged in pleasures, and some, lacking in merit, became dry,
meaning they went to hell and other lower realms, where they wept and suffered
the consequences of their actions. ||56-58||  O Shrenika, in this world,
afflictions and joys are like a wheel, constantly turning. Sometimes afflictions
become like festivals, and sometimes festivals become like afflictions.
Sometimes, in this being, the defects of Maya, etc., gradually increase. ||59||
Sometimes these beings die and suffer, and sometimes they die in childhood due
to the depletion of their pre-ordained lifespan or some other reason. ||60||
Sometimes these beings take on various forms, sometimes they remain as they are,
sometimes they kill each other, sometimes they grieve, sometimes they cry,
sometimes they eat, sometimes they cause harm, sometimes they argue, sometimes
they go, sometimes they walk, sometimes they become powerful, meaning they
become masters, sometimes they carry burdens, sometimes they sing, sometimes
they worship, sometimes they eat, sometimes they become poor, sometimes they
speak. ||61-62||  Sometimes they win, sometimes they give, sometimes they
release, sometimes they rule, sometimes they adorn themselves with many
luxuries, sometimes they are content, sometimes they rule, sometimes they desire
peace, meaning forgiveness, sometimes they destroy peace. ||63||  Sometimes they
are ashamed, sometimes they behave in a vile manner, sometimes they torment
others, sometimes they are distressed, sometimes they are deceitful, sometimes
they beg, sometimes they run forward, sometimes...

The Twenty-First Chapter  442. They play, they go, they give, they discipline,

65. They are pleased, they worship, they deceive, they console, they understand.
They are infatuated, they protect, they dance, they love, they are humble. 66.
They inspire, they gather grain, they plow, they cook, they bow. They play, they

69. They contemplate, they abhor, they desire, they swim, they treat, they
approve, they stop, they swallow. 70. O King! Thus, many humans in the Ikshvaku
dynasty were engrossed in a web of actions and were engaged in auspicious and
inauspicious deeds. 71. In this way, time, known as Avasarpini, which is like a
moving picture depicting the various actions of all humans, gradually comes to
an end. 72. After that, in the interval of the present Tirthankara, where the
arrival of the gods continues, there was a great king named Vijay in the vast
city of Ayodhya. He had conquered all his enemies. He was endowed with the
brilliance of the sun and was skilled in the welfare of his subjects. 73-74. His
queen was Hemchula, a woman of great brilliance, and she gave birth to a son
named Surendramanyu, who was endowed with great virtues. 75. Surendramanyu had a
wife named Kirtisama, and they had two sons who were as radiant as the moon and
the sun. Both sons were adorned with virtues. 1. Shidanti M. 2. Bhanti M. 3.

450 In the Padma Purana, the elder son was Vajraबाहु and the younger son was
Purandar. Both of them bore meaningful names and enjoyed happiness in the world.
||77|| In those days, the king named Ibhavahana ruled in the beautiful city of
Hastinapur. His wife's name was Chudamani. They had a very beautiful daughter
named Manodaya. She was obtained by the most praiseworthy Vajraबाहु Kumar among
men. ||78-79|| Once, the daughter's brother, Udayasundar, went to Vajraबाहु's
house to take the girl. Vajraबाहु, adorned with a beautiful white umbrella, was
also eager to go with him. ||80|| That girl was famous throughout the earth for
her beauty. Vajraबाहु, holding her in his mind, set out for his father-in-law's
city with great pomp. ||81|| Then, while walking, his gaze fell upon the
beautiful mountain named Vasant, which was filled with spring flowers. ||82|| As
he approached the mountain, he was filled with joy at the sight of its supreme
beauty. ||83|| The fragrant wind, mixed with flower dust, embraced him, as if a
friend long lost had embraced him. ||84|| The mountain, with its treetops
swaying in the wind, seemed to be cheering for Vajraबाहु with the sound of the
male cuckoos. ||85|| The sound of the intoxicated, melodious, bee-like buzzing,
like the sound of a veena, captivated his ears and mind. ||86|| 'This is a mango
tree, this is a kener, this is a lodhra with flowers, this is a priyal, and this
is a palash, shining like a burning fire.' Thus, his steady gaze, moving in
sequence, fell upon the sage, whose human form was doubtful due to the distance.
||87-88|| Vajraबाहु was perplexed about the sage, who was sitting in a state of
kayothsarga, wondering if he was a stump, a sage, or a mountain peak. ||89||
Then, when he reached the very nearby path, he was certain that he was a great
yogi-sage. ||90|| That sage was situated on a rough terrain of high and low
rocks. His face, touched by the rays of the sun, was pale and his lotus-like
face was drooping. ||91||

## The Twenty-First Chapter  Standing firm on the uneven ground, his face pale
from the sun's rays, his two excellent arms hanging down like a large serpent,
his chest broad and wide like the shore of Mount Meru, his two shining thighs
steady like the pillars that bind the elephants, though thin from austerity, he
appeared very stout due to his radiance. He had fixed his extremely gentle and
unwavering eyes on the tip of his nose. Seeing the Muni meditating with such
single-pointed focus, King Vajraबाहु began to think:  "Oh, how blessed is this
extremely peaceful, excellent human being who, renouncing all attachments, is
performing austerities with the desire for liberation! He is graced by
liberation, his mind is absorbed in his own welfare, his soul is free from
harming others, he is adorned by the divine Lakshmi. He is equal in his attitude
towards friend and foe, a heap of jewels and a blade of grass. He is free from
pride and envy, his desire for the embrace of the divine consort Siddhi is
growing. He has subdued his senses and mind, he is steady like Mount Meru, he is
free from attachment, and his mind is fixed on virtuous actions."  "He has
received the full fruit of his human birth. He has not been cheated by the
cruel, malicious thieves of the senses."  "And me? I am constantly bound by the
chains of karma, just as the sandalwood tree is bound by the great serpents of
the Ashivisha clan. Shame on me, this inert, sinful being whose mind is filled
with delusion. I am sleeping on the top of the great, round rock of the mountain
of enjoyment."  "If I could only attain the state of this yogi, then I would
have achieved the fruit of my human birth."  Thinking thus, the eyes of King
Vajraबाहु, the master of the unfettered, became as steady as if fixed on a
pillar.  Seeing him with such unwavering gaze, Udayasundara, with a pleasant
smile, said jokingly:  "You have been observing this Muni for a long time, so
are you taking this initiation? You seem to be attached to it."  Then,
concealing his feelings, Vajraबाहु said:  "What is your opinion, Uday? Tell me."

452 Not knowing his inner detachment, Udayasundara, with a fondness for jest,
said, his lips adorned with the gleam of his teeth:  “If you accept this
initiation, then I too will be your friend. Oh, Kumar! You will be adorned with
the glory of a Shraman.”  “So be it,” said Vajrabahu, adorned with the ornaments
of marriage, and he descended from the elephant and ascended the mountain.  Then
the women, with their large eyes, wept loudly. Large drops of tears, like
strings of broken pearls, fell from their eyes.  With tears in his eyes,
Udayasundara said, “Be pleased, Deva! What are you doing? I was only jesting.”
Vajrabahu, soothing him with sweet words, said, “Oh, one with a heart of good
intentions! I was falling into a well, and you saved me.  There is no other
friend like you in the three worlds. Oh, beautiful one! It is inevitable that
those who are born must die, and those who die must be reborn.  This machine of
birth and death, more fickle than lightning, waves, and the tongue of a venomous
serpent, keeps turning constantly.  Why don’t you see the life of this world,
consumed by sorrow? Enjoyments are like dreams, life is like a bubble, affection
is like the glow of twilight, and youth is like a flower. Oh, Bhadra! Your jest
has become like nectar to me.  What is drunk in jest? Does it not cure disease?
Since you have turned me towards my welfare, you are my friend today.  I was
engrossed in the ways of the world, but today you have made me detached from it.
Now, I take initiation. Do as you please.”  Saying this, he went to the Muni
Raja named Gunasagara, and bowing at his feet, with folded hands, he said, “Oh,
Master! My mind has been purified by your grace, so today I wish to leave this
terrible prison of the world.”  1. Yajnatvattamaho-m., j. - Manyatvatta-b. 2.

## The Twenty-First Chapter  Then, the Muni (sage) approved of his disciple's
actions. Filled with great fervor, Vajraबाहु renounced his clothes and
ornaments.  He sat down on a lotus posture, his mind filled with fervor. With
hands like red petals, he plucked out his hair. At that moment, he felt his body
become light, as if freed from illness. He renounced the marriage-related
initiation and embraced the initiation leading to liberation.   Those who had
renounced attachment, aversion, and pride, whose speed was towards fervor, and
who were like beautiful, illusory beings, such as Udayasundar and the other
twenty-six princes, filled with utmost enthusiasm, bowed to the Muni and took
initiation.   Knowing this, Manodaya, filled with brotherly love and great
fervor, also took initiation.  She, whose large breasts were covered with white
cloth, whose belly was thin, and whose body was covered in dust, became a great
ascetic.  When Vijayasyandan, Vajraबाहु's father, heard this news, he was filled
with sorrow and spoke in the middle of the assembly, "Oh, what a wonder! My
grandson, still in his youth, has renounced worldly pleasures and embraced the
Digambara initiation.  Even I, an old man, am still bound by these pleasures
that are difficult to renounce. How could this young prince abandon them?  Or
perhaps, he has been blessed with the fortune of liberation, and has renounced
these pleasures like straw, attaining a state of peace.  I, who am unfortunate,
what should I do now, burdened by old age?  For a long time, I have been
deceived by these sinful pleasures, which seemed beautiful at first.  My hair,
which was once the color of indigo gems, has now turned white like a pile of
straw.  My eyes, which were once captivating with their white, black, and red
hues, are now veiled by the dust of old age."

Wealth, righteousness, and desire, these three are appropriate for a young man.
For an aged man, they are difficult to attain. ||136|| Alas, I am a senseless,
wicked, careless, and foolish man, caught in the whirlpool of false affection
for my relatives. ||137|| Having said this, and without consulting his
relatives, the king, with a detached heart, bestowed the kingdom upon his
grandson, Purandara, and, with his son, Surendramanu, took initiation from the
great soul, Nirvanaghoṣa, the liberated one. ||138-139|| Thereafter, Purandara's
wife, Prithivimati, gave birth to a son named Kirtidhara, who was like an ocean
of all renowned virtues. ||140|| By his charming conduct, Kirtidhara, ever
respectful, gradually attained youth, delighting all his relatives. ||141||
Then, King Purandara, having chosen a daughter of the king of Kosala, arranged
for his son's marriage. After this, the king, renouncing worldly attachments,
left his home. ||142|| Adorned with the ornaments of virtues, King Purandara,
taking initiation from the sage Kṣemaṅkara, began to perform severe austerities
to eradicate the effects of his past actions. ||143|| Meanwhile, Kirtidhara, the
conqueror of his enemies, ruled the kingdom inherited from his ancestors,
enjoying the pleasures of life like the best of gods. ||144|| Once, Kirtidhara,
the king who was a friend to his subjects and who terrified his enemies, was
seated on a comfortable throne in his beautiful palace, resplendent like the
celestial being Nalakubara, when his gaze fell upon the sun, obscured by the
blue radiance of a solar eclipse. Seeing this, he thought, "Alas! This calamity
cannot be averted by any means." ||145-146|| Sun 1. Pavanirvāṇa M. ||

## Chapter Twenty-One  **Verse 147** Even though the moon, devoid of brilliance,
destroys the terrible darkness and causes the lotus forest to bloom, the sun is
unable to dispel Rahu.  **Verse 148** Just as this sun is being destroyed, so
too will this youthful sun, afflicted by the eclipse of old age, be destroyed.
Bound by the strong ropes of fate, this poor creature will inevitably enter the
jaws of death.  **Verse 149** Considering this world to be impermanent, King
Kirtidhara addressed his ministers assembled in the court, saying, "Oh
ministers! Protect this earth, bounded by the ocean. I am departing on the path
of liberation."  **Verse 150** Upon hearing this, the assembly, filled with wise
men and relatives, became filled with sorrow and said, "Oh King! You are the
only husband of this entire earth."  **Verse 151** This earth, under your
control, and with all enemies defeated, will not be adorned without you.
Possessing great strength in your youth, rule like Indra.  **Verse 152** The
king replied, "Seeing this forest of afflictions, filled with the trees of
birth, enveloped in the fire of old age, separation, and aversion, and extremely
long, I am filled with great fear."  **Verse 153** When the ministers understood
the king's firm resolve, they extinguished a large pile of burning embers and
placed a beautiful, radiant, and excellent vaidurya gem in the middle. Its
brilliance illuminated the extinguished embers.

456 Padma Purana Upeendra Vajra Vrittam Again, the king spoke in Upeendra Vajra
Vrittam, as follows: "O King, just as a pile of coals does not shine without a
gem, so too, this world does not shine without you. ||154|| O Lord, without you,
this entire population, bereft of their protector, will become helpless and
perish. With the destruction of the people, Dharma will be destroyed, and with
the destruction of Dharma, what will not be destroyed? Tell me. ||155||
Therefore, just as your father, giving you to the people for their protection,
performed austerities and became adept at giving liberation, so too, you should
protect the Dharma of your lineage. ||156|| Thus, being advised by his wise
ministers, Kirtidhara made a vow. Hearing of the birth of his son, he would
surely take the exalted path of the munis. ||157|| Then, that king Kirtidhara,
whose power was like Indra's, whose soul was always alert, ruled the vast earth,
free from all fear, for a long time, with a well-established order. ||158||
Then, for a long time, Queen Sahadevi, enjoying happiness with King Kirtidhara,
gave birth to a son, complete in all virtues, capable of bearing the earth.
||159|| Upajati Vrittam There was no celebration of the birth, for fear that the
news might reach the king's ears. And so, for many days, the time of confinement
was like a prison. ||160||

## Chapter Twenty-One: The Lineage and Story of Kirti Dhar  **457**  How could
the child, shining like the sun, be kept hidden for long?  A poor man, driven by
greed, informed the king, revealing the secret.  [161]  The king, overjoyed,
bestowed upon him a crown and other ornaments, along with the beautiful city of
Ghosha, a branch city, adorned with a hundred prosperous villages.  [162]  He
summoned the child, born of a single parent, and placed him on his throne,
surrounded by great splendor, earning the respect of all.  [163]  The city of
Kosala became exceptionally beautiful due to the child's birth.  Therefore, the
child, known for his noble deeds, was named Sukosala.  [164]  Leaving the
confines of his palace, Kirti Dhar, the king, went to the forest of penance and,
radiating the brilliance of his spiritual practice, shone like the sun, free
from the constraints of material wealth.  [165]  Thus ends the twenty-first
chapter of the Padma Charita, narrated by Acharya Ravishena, titled "The
Greatness of Muni Suvrata, Vajra Bahu, and Kirti Dhar."  [21]  **Time is kept
secret and protected.** [160]

The Twenty-Second Chapter  Then the great ascetic, the Lord who was as forgiving
as the earth, whose body was covered with a garment of dirt, who had renounced
pride, who was magnanimous, whose entire body was dried up by austerities, who
was a hero, who considered his matted hair as an ornament, whose long arms hung
down, whose eyes looked at the path of four cubits, who walked slowly like a
drunken elephant, who was free from all impurities, who was full of
concentration, who was humble, who was free from greed, who followed the
teachings of the scriptures, whose mind was pure with compassion, who was free
from the mire of affection, who was adorned with the glory of a monk, and who
had been fasting for a long time, such a glorious monk, while wandering, reached
his former home, which he had obtained in due course, and entered it for alms.
Seeing him, Sahadevi, his wife, stood at the window, her eyes fixed on him. She
was filled with extreme anger. Her face was flushed with anger. With her lips
clenched, she said to the gatekeepers with evil intentions, "This monk is going
to destroy the house, so let him be driven out quickly."  The innocent, beloved
by all, and gentle by nature, the young prince, as long as he did not see him,
quickly said, "Drive him away." Not only that, if I see any other naked man
inside the palace, remember, I will surely punish you, gatekeepers. Since this
heartless man left Shishuputra, I have not been happy with these people.  These
people hate the royal fortune, which is served by great heroes, and they cause
great distress to men who are devoted to great endeavors.  Thus, with her face
distorted by harsh words, and holding a staff in her hand, the yogi was quickly
driven away.

## Twenty-Second Chapter  Even all other Lingins were expelled from the city at
that time. The king was afraid that the prince would hear the word Dharma. || 13
||  Hearing and seeing the Muni-punga who was being robbed by words, the devoted
Kirti-dhar's foster mother, Su-koshal, was filled with grief and sorrow. || 14
|| Recognizing her master Kirti-dhar after a long time, she cried out loud,
tearing her throat. || 15 ||  Hearing her cry, Su-koshal came to her and
comforted her, saying, "Mother, who has wronged you?" || 16 ||  "Mother only
carried this body in her womb, but this body has reached this state only because
of your milk." || 17 ||  "You are more honorable to me than my mother. Tell me,
who, desiring to enter the mouth of Yama, has insulted you?" || 18 ||  "If even
my mother has defeated you today, I am ready to be disrespectful to her, what to
speak of others?" || 19 ||  Then, the foster mother, Vasanti-lata, with great
difficulty, reduced the flow of her tears and told Su-koshal, "Your father, who
had you crowned king in your childhood and then, fearing the cage of worldly
sorrows, entered the forest of penance, has come to your house today for alms.
Your mother, by her authority, had him expelled by the gatekeepers." || 20-22 ||
"Seeing him being humiliated, I was filled with great sorrow, and I could not
stop it. Therefore, my dear son, I am crying." || 23 ||  "Who can defeat the one
whom you always see with honor? This is the reason for my crying, which I have
told you." || 24 ||  "Remembering the favor that Lord Kirti-dhar did for us at
that time, my body starts burning freely." || 25 ||  "This body of mine is stuck
here to be a recipient of suffering due to the rise of sin. It seems to be made
of iron, for even in the separation of the Lord, it remains steady." || 26 ||
The Nirgrantha Munis were expelled by the wicked gatekeepers from afar. || 12 ||
Not only them, but all other Munis residing in the city were also expelled from
the city, fearing that the prince residing in the palace would hear the word
Dharma. || 13 ||  The Muni-punga, who was robbed by words, was heard and seen by
Su-koshal, the devoted foster mother of Kirti-dhar, whose grief was renewed. She
recognized her master Kirti-dhar after a long time and cried out loud, tearing
her throat. || 14-15 ||  Hearing her cry, Su-koshal came to her and comforted
her, saying, "Mother, who has wronged you?" || 16 ||  "Mother only carried this
body in her womb, but this body has reached this state only because of your
milk." || 17 ||  "You are more honorable to me than my mother. Tell me, who,
desiring to enter the mouth of Yama, has insulted you?" || 18 ||  "If even my
mother has defeated you today, I am ready to be disrespectful to her, what to
speak of others?" || 19 ||  Then, the foster mother, Vasanti-lata, with great
difficulty, reduced the flow of her tears and told Su-koshal, "Your father, who
had you crowned king in your childhood and then, fearing the cage of worldly
sorrows, entered the forest of penance, has come to your house today for alms.
Your mother, by her authority, had him expelled by the gatekeepers." || 20-22 ||

460 Seeing the Muni in the city, the king was afraid that his son would become
dispassionate. Therefore, he prohibited the entry of the Muni into the city.
||27|| This is the Dharma that has been passed down in your lineage, that you
should give the kingdom to your son and serve the Tapovan. ||28|| Don't you know
the decision of the ministers? You will never be able to leave this house.
||29|| For this reason, the ministers, who are wise in policy, have made
arrangements for you and others in this very house. ||30|| Hearing the entire
account from the messenger, Sukoshal quickly descended from the top of the
palace. ||31|| Leaving behind the royal insignia like the umbrella and the fly
whisk, he walked on foot, his feet adorned with a soft, lotus-like radiance. He
was graced by Lakshmi and inquired along the way, "Have you seen a great Muni
anywhere here?" Filled with utmost eagerness, Prince Sukoshal reached his
father. ||32-33|| His attendants, including the umbrella-holders, were all
agitated and ran after him in a flurry. ||34|| Reaching the place, he
circumambulated his father, Kirtidhar Muni, who was seated on a magnificent,
excellent stone platform, three times. His eyes were filled with tears, and his
emotions were sublime. ||35|| He joined his hands, touched his forehead with
them, and prostrated himself with his knees and forehead touching the ground,
paying his respects to his father with great affection. ||36|| He folded his
hands and sat before the Muni with humility. As if he was ashamed of the Muni
being rejected from his home. ||37|| He said to the Muni, "Just as a group of
clouds with loud thunder wakes up people sleeping in a house engulfed in flames,
so too, in this house of the world, burning with the fire of birth and death, I
was asleep, embraced by the sleep of delusion. O Lord! You have awakened me."
||38-39|| "Be pleased and grant me the same initiation that you have taken
yourself. O Lord! Please liberate me from the troubles of worldly desires."
||40|| While Sukoshal was speaking with his head bowed, the entire assembly of
his vassals arrived. ||41||

## The Twenty-Second Chapter  The queen, Vichitramala, carrying the weight of
her pregnancy, filled with sorrow, arrived with the inner palace. ||42|| Knowing
that Sukoshal was about to take the initiation, a soft humming sound, like the
buzzing of a bee, arose from the inner palace. ||43|| Sukoshal said, "If this
child in Vichitramala's womb is a son, I have given him the kingdom." Saying
this, he became indifferent, severed the bonds of hope, burned the cage of
affection, broke the chains of his wife, and abandoned the kingdom like a blade
of grass. ||44-45|| He renounced all ornaments, discarded both internal and
external possessions, sat on a simple seat, and cut his hair. ||46|| He took the
great vows, with firm determination, and with a peaceful mind, he wandered with
his father. ||47|| As he walked, the red rays of his feet seemed to offer lotus
flowers to the earth. People looked at him with wonder. ||48|| Sahadevi, filled
with false beliefs and devoted to sin, died and was reborn in a lower animal
form. ||49|| Father and son wandered together, following the course of the sun.
When the sun set, they would rest. Then, the rainy season arrived, darkening the
sky. ||50|| The sky, covered with dark clouds, seemed to be plastered with cow
dung. Here and there, flying vultures made it seem as if the sky was being
adorned with clusters of white lotuses. ||51|| The large buds of the Kadamba
trees, buzzing with bees, seemed to be singing the praises of the king of the
rainy season. ||52|| The world seemed to be filled with clusters of blue
collyrium, like towering mountains. The moon and the sun had gone, as if they
were frightened by the roar of the clouds. ||53|| Uninterrupted streams of water
poured from the sky, making it seem as if the sky itself was melting and
flowing. The earth, covered with green grass, seemed to be wearing a garment of
contentment. ||54||

462 Padmapurana 3 Just as the mind of an extremely wicked person makes all high
and low equal, so the flood of water flowing with great speed made all the high
and low land equal. ||55|| The masses of water on the earth were roaring, and
the masses of clouds in the sky were roaring, as if they were searching for the
fleeing summer, the enemy. ||56|| The mountains adorned with waterfalls were
covered with very dense clusters of creepers. They looked as if the clouds had
fallen down under the weight of a lot of water. ||57|| In the natural land of
the forest, moving here and there, Indragopa (Veerbahuti) insects were visible.
They looked as if the pieces of the sun, ground by the clouds, had fallen on the
earth. ||58|| The lightning was moving quickly in all directions, as if the eye
of the sky was looking to see which country was filled with water and which was
not. ||59|| The sky was adorned with a rainbow, holding many kinds of
brilliance, as if it were adorned with a very high and beautiful archway. ||60||
The polluted rivers, which were bringing down both banks, in which terrible
whirlpools were rising, and which were flowing with great speed, looked like
adulterous women. ||61|| The women who were frightened by the roar of the
clouds, and whose eyes were as fickle as those of a deer, were quickly embracing
the pillars. ||62|| The emigrants, whose consciousness was being shaken by the
extremely terrible roar, were bewildered, with their eyes fixed in the direction
where the woman was. ||63|| The Digambar Muni Rajas, who were always eager to
practice compassion (mercy), having reached the Prasoo place, had taken the vow
of the Chaturmas Vrat. ||64|| The Shravakas, who were observing various kinds of
vows, such as Aakhari, etc., according to their strength, and who were always
eager to serve the saints, had taken the Digvrat. ||65|| Thus, when the rainy
season arrived, filled with clouds, the two father and son, the Nirgrantha
saints Kirtidhar Muni Raj and Sukoshal Swami, observing the appropriate conduct,
came to the cremation ground, which was filled with the darkness of trees, 1.

## Twenty-Second Chapter  The cremation ground was vast, filled with snakes and
other ferocious creatures. It was difficult to traverse, with its many small
hills, and terrifying even to the most fearsome beings. The air was thick with
the sounds of crows, vultures, bears, and jackals. Half-burnt corpses lay
scattered about, making the place even more dreadful. The ground was white in
places, covered with piles of skulls. The wind carried a strong, putrid smell of
decaying fat. The place was filled with laughter, and throngs of terrifying
demons and Vetalas. The trees were entangled with clumps of grass and vines.  In
this vast cremation ground, two ascetics, father and son, with pure minds and
the wealth of tapas, wandered together, arriving there by chance on the full
moon of Ashadha.   Free from all desires, the two ascetics took up a four-month
fast, settling down at the foot of a tree where the leaves had fallen and the
water was clear. They spent their time in various postures, sometimes in
Paryankaasana, sometimes in Kayotsarga, and sometimes in Viraasana and other
postures. In this way, they passed the rainy season.  Then came the autumn
season, when all human endeavors were in full swing. It was like the dawn,
illuminating the entire world with its brilliance. In the sky, white clouds
appeared, resembling clusters of blooming Kash flowers, swaying gently.   Just
as the glorious beings, the Jinas, shine brightly after the passing of the
Dushama-kala of the ascending time, so too did the sun shine brightly in the
sky, free from the presence of clouds.   The moon shone brightly amidst the
stars, like a young swan amidst a cluster of lotuses.   The entire world was
bathed in the white light of the moon, like a sea of milk flowing from the mouth
of a river.   The rivers were filled with joy, their sandy banks marked by
waves. The sounds of cranes, sarasa birds, and chakwas filled the air, as if
they were engaged in conversation.   The lotus ponds were adorned with clusters
of lotuses, buzzing with bees, as if they were adorned with false jewels.

464 In the Padma Purana, the bees buzz around the lotuses in the lakes, just
like the group of the liberated souls, free from the accumulation of the false
beliefs. ||8|| The wealthy people, accompanied by their beloved ones, enjoy
themselves in the beautiful palaces, adorned with flowers, during the night.
||8|| The gatherings of the couples, who were separated, take place, where their
friends and relatives are honored and where great festivals are celebrated.
||8|| The ascetics wander in the places of the great glory of the Jinas, where
the auspicious events like the conception, birth, etc. of the Jinas took place,
after the full moon of the Kartik month. ||8|| Then, the two monks, whose vow of
the four-month fast was completed, started to go to the city for the breaking of
the fast, with the speed suitable for the time. ||84|| Seeing them, the tigress,
who was Sahadevi in her previous life, became filled with anger. Her hair,
stained with blood, was scattered and trembling. Her face was terrifying with
her fangs. Her yellow eyes were sparkling. Her round tail was touching her head.
She was digging the earth with her claws. She was roaring loudly. She looked
like a female demon, with her red tongue flickering. She was carrying a radiant
body, and she looked like the midday sun. After playing for a long time, she
jumped high, aiming at Sukoshala Swami. ||85-88|| Seeing her jumping, the two
monks, who were adorned with beautiful radiance, stood firm with their bodies,
fearless, with the vow of "If we survive this calamity, we will eat and drink,
otherwise not." ||89|| The merciless tigress fell upon Sukoshala Muni, tearing
his head and other parts of his body with her claws, and fell to the ground.
||90|| She tore his whole body, so that he looked like a mountain, from which
streams of water mixed with ochre and other metals were flowing. ||91|| Then,
she stood in front of him, performing various tricks, and started eating him
from his feet. ||92|| 1. Sahadevi in her previous life, Sahadevi-chari. 2.
Fearless with the vow, M. 3. From the head, M. 4. Tearing him from his feet. 5.
This verse is not in the K. book. 6. Of him, K.

## The Twenty-Second Chapter  **465** Behold, O Shrenik, the workings of
delusion in the world, where a mother devours the body of her beloved son.
||13|| What greater sorrow can there be than that, blinded by past lives,
relatives become enemies and perpetrators of evil. ||14||   Then, for this
Sukoshal, steadfast like Mount Meru, and immersed in white meditation,  Kevala
Jnana arose before the shedding of his body. ||15||  Indra, along with the gods
and demons, came and, filled with joy, worshipped his body with divine flowers
and other treasures. ||16||   The tigress, enlightened by the wise words of
Kirti Dhar, embraced renunciation and attained heaven. ||97||  Then, Kevala
Jnana arose for Kirti Dhar as well.  The journey of these two, father and son,
became a glorious event for the gods. ||98||  The gods and demons, proclaiming
the supreme glory of Kevala Jnana, bowed down to the feet of the two Kevalins
and went to their respective places. ||99||  Gautama Swami says, "He who studies
the greatness of Sukoshal Swami, will be free from calamities and live happily
for a long time." ||100||  Then, at the completion of her pregnancy,
Vichitramala, the wife of Sukoshal, gave birth to a son with a beautiful and
auspicious body. ||101||  Because the mother became as beautiful as gold while
the child was in her womb, he was named Hiranyagarbha. ||102||  Hiranyagarbha, a
king of great virtue, brought back the time of Lord Rishabhadeva. He married
Amritavati, the virtuous daughter of King Hari. ||103||  King Hiranyagarbha was
blessed with friends and relatives, a master of all scriptures, possessed
inexhaustible wealth, was glorious, and as beautiful as Mount Sumeru.  He was
also magnanimous.  While enjoying the finest pleasures, he noticed a white hair
amidst his black hair, like a bee. ||104-105||  Seeing that white hair in the
mirror, he was filled with sorrow, as if he had been summoned by the messenger
of death. ||106||

In the Padma Purana,  (107) He thought, "Alas, it is a great hardship that my
limbs are being forcibly taken away by this old age, which destroys strength and
radiance." (108) My body, which is like a sandalwood tree, will now be burnt by
the fire of old age and become like a coal." (109) The disease, which is like a
hole, has been waiting for a long time, and now it will enter my body like a
demon." (110) "Death, who is eager to devour, has been standing like a tiger for
a long time, and now he will devour my body." (111) "Those young men who have
reached this land of action and have boarded the boat of vows, will cross the
ocean of existence." (112) Thinking thus, he placed his son, Amritavati, on the
throne and went to the pure yogis to take initiation. (113) Since no
inauspiciousness was declared when he was in the womb, he was known as
"Nighusha," and he had conquered the whole world with his virtues. (114) Then,
leaving his queen, Singhika, in the city, King Nighusha went to the north to
subdue his hostile enemies. (115) The kings of the south, knowing that Nighusha
was far away, came to seize his city of Ayodhya. They were accompanied by a
large army. (116) But the very valiant Queen Singhika defeated them all in
battle. She appointed a trustworthy king to protect the city and, with the
defeated vassals, went south to conquer the remaining kings. She had worked hard
in both weapons and scriptures. (117) She conquered the hostile vassals with her
own prowess and returned to the city, filling the directions with the sound of
victory. (118) When King Nighusha returned after subduing the north, he was very
angry, having heard of his wife's valor.

## Twenty-Second Chapter  **467**  The king, convinced that the noble lady could
not have been so audacious, became estranged from the Lioness. **120**  Despite
her virtuous conduct, she was removed from the position of Mahadevi by the king.
Thus, she was reduced to great poverty and endured hardship for some time.
**121**  Later, the king was afflicted by a severe burning fever, which could
not be cured by any medicine prescribed by the physicians. **122**  Upon
learning of this, the Lioness was overwhelmed with grief.  She then devised a
plan to prove her innocence. **123**  She summoned all her relatives, vassals,
and subjects, and holding water given to her by the priest in her cupped hands,
she declared, "If I have not harbored any other man in my heart, then let this
water, sprinkled upon the king, cure him of his fever." **124-125**  As soon as
a single drop of the water from the Lioness's hand touched the king, he became
as cold as if he had been plunged into ice.  The chill caused his teeth to
chatter like a vina. **126**  At that moment, the sky was filled with the sound
of "Sadhu! Sadhu!" and the air was showered with flowers released by unseen
beings. **127**  Recognizing the Lioness's virtue, King Nahusha reinstated her
as Mahadevi and paid her great homage. **128**  Free from enemies, he enjoyed
pleasures with her for a long time, following all the customs of his ancestors.
Despite his enjoyment of worldly pleasures, he remained detached in his heart.
**129**  Finally, he bestowed the kingdom upon his son, born to the Lioness, and
followed the path of his father, embracing the Jain path. **130**  King Nahusha,
having subdued all his enemies, was known as Sudasa.  Therefore, his son was
known throughout the world as Saudasa (the son of Sudasa). **131**  In his
lineage, for eight days, even after the completion of four months, no one
consumed meat, even those who were accustomed to eating meat. **132**

468 In the Padma Purana, it is said that due to the arousal of some inauspicious
karma, the king Saudas developed a desire to eat meat on those very days.
||133|| Then, calling the cook aside, he said, "O Bhadra! I have a desire to eat
meat today." ||134|| The cook replied, "O King! You know that on these days,
throughout the entire earth, there is a grand celebration of the Jina's worship
and the killing of living beings is prohibited." ||135|| Hearing this, the king
said to the cook, "If I don't eat meat today, I will die. Having decided this,
do whatever is right. What is the use of talking?" ||136|| Knowing the king's
condition, the cook went outside the city. There, he saw a dead child abandoned
in the ditch on that very day. ||137|| Wrapping it in cloth, he brought it,
cooked it with delicious things, and gave it to the king to eat, thinking, "This
is suitable for him." ||138|| The king, whose mind was extremely delighted by
the taste of human flesh, ate it and, getting up, said to the cook in
astonishment, "O Bhadra! Where did you get this meat, whose taste is so
extremely sweet, which I have never tasted before?" ||139-140|| In response, the
cook, seeking his protection, told him everything as it was. Then the king said,
"Let this be done always." ||141|| Thereafter, the cook started giving laddoos
to the small children. Enticed by them, the children started coming to him every
day. ||142|| When the children went to take the laddoos, the one who lagged
behind was killed, cooked, and given to the king continuously. ||143|| When the
children of the city started decreasing every day, the people realized this and
expelled the king and the cook from the city. ||144|| Saudas had a son named
Simharatha born to his wife Kanakamba. The city dwellers installed him on the
throne, and all the kings bowed to him. ||145|| King Saudas became so attached
to human flesh that he even ate his cook. ||146|| When the month was over and
the eight days of the Ashtahnika came, no one in his lineage ate meat, even if
their body was nourished by it. ||132||

The Twenty-second Chapter 469 Just as a lion's food is meat, so too was his
[Saudasa's] food. Thus, he became known in the world as 'Sinhsaudasa' [the lion-
like Saudasa]. 147 After reaching the Dakshinapatha [southern region], he
obtained shelter under a Digambara ascetic and, upon hearing the doctrine,
became a great observer of the Anuvrata [minor vows]. 148 Then, when the queen
of the great city died without a son, he was installed on the throne by the
royal elephant. 149 He then sent an envoy to his son, urging him to pay
obeisance, but the son, fearless, wrote back saying, "I will not bow down to one
who has engaged in despicable conduct." 150 Thereupon, Saudasa marched against
his entire domain, and the people fled in terror of being devoured. 151 After
defeating his son in battle and reinstating him on the throne, the now virtuous
Saudasa, filled with great remorse, entered the forest for penance. 152
Thereafter, from Brahmaratha were born Chaturvaktra, Dharmaratha, Shatarath,
Mandhata, Virasena, Pratimamyu, Kamalabandhava (also known as Kamalabandhus for
his radiance), Ravimamyu (also known as Vasantatilaka), Kuberadatta,
Kunthubhakti (the renowned one), Sharabhardvaja, Dviradrath, Mrigeshadvamana,
Hiranyakashipu, Pujjasthala, Kakutstha, and the supremely valorous Raghu.
153-158 These kings born in the Ikshvaku lineage attained moksha after taking up
the Digambara vow. 159 Thereafter, the great king Anaranya was born, the one who
made the land devoid of forests by settling people there. 160

470 Padma Purana The great queen Prithivimati, endowed with great virtues,
resided in the midst of a circle of radiance, bringing happiness to all senses.
||161|| She had two sons, both of excellent qualities. The elder was known as
Anantarath, and the younger as Dasharath. ||162|| Anantarath had an excellent
friendship with Anaranya, the king of Mahishmati, who was known as
Sahasrarashmi. ||163|| These two noble men, bound by mutual affection, lived in
their respective abodes, like Sudharma and Aishaneindra. ||164|| After being
defeated by Ravana in battle, Sahasrarashmi attained enlightenment and, with
great fervor, embraced Jaineshwari initiation. ||165|| Having learned all the
details from the messenger sent by Anantarath, Dasharath, who was only a month
old, relinquished the royal fortune and, with great detachment, went to the
great Nirgrantha, Abhayasena, along with his elder brother Anantarath.
||166-167|| Anaranya, the sage, departed for liberation, while Anantarath, free
from all attachments, wandered the earth as befits a sage. ||168|| Anantarath,
who was not shaken by the twenty-two Pariṣahas, became known as Anantavirya on
earth. ||169|| Dasharath then acquired a body adorned with youthful vigor, as
tall as a mountain peak, and decorated with various flowers. ||170|| He then
married Aparajita, the daughter of King Sukoshala, the lord of Darmasthala, who
was born of the great queen Amritaprabhava, and who was known for her beautiful
movements. Aparajita was so virtuous that even desire could not conquer her.
||171-172|| There was a magnificent city called Kamalasankula. Its king was
Subandhutilaka, and his wife was Mitra. They had a virtuous daughter named
Kaikeyi, whose eyes were like blue lotuses, and whose head was adorned with a
garland of them. ||173-174||

## Twenty-Second Chapter  **471**  Since she was born from a mother named Mitra,
who was of excellent conduct and beautiful, she became known in the world as
Sumitra. **175**  The great king also married another princess named Suprabha,
who was radiant with beauty and brought prosperity. **176**  King Dasharatha
obtained both Right-Faith and a kingdom full of glory. He considered Right-Faith
as a jewel and the kingdom as mere grass. **177**  The reason for this is that
if one does not renounce the kingdom, it leads to downfall, while Right-Faith
leads to an unquestionable ascent. **178**  King Dasharatha repaired the
beautiful temples of the Jinas, which had fallen into disrepair, that were built
by the kings Bharata and others. **179**  He also built new temples of the
Jinas, which were praised by Indra himself, and were adorned with a multitude of
jewels, radiating brilliance. **180**  Gautama Swami tells King Shrenik, "O
King! Those who accumulate virtue in other births, attain the most beautiful
prosperity of the gods, and are reborn in this world as fortunate beings like
King Dasharatha, radiating brilliance like the sun, and attaining prosperity."
**181**  Thus ends the twenty-second chapter of the Padmacharita, narrated by
the Acharya, known as Ravisha, and containing the story of the birth of King
Dasharatha, along with the greatness of Sukoshala Swami.

## The Twenty-Third Chapter  Once upon a time, King Dasharatha, adorned with
great brilliance and resembling Indra in splendor, was seated in his assembly,
engrossed in the tales of the Jina Kings. Suddenly, Narada, a wise man and a
beacon of virtue, arrived, his body radiating light.    The King rose to greet
him, offering him a comfortable seat. Narada blessed the King, and the wise King
inquired about his well-being. Narada replied with news of his welfare, and the
King, in turn, asked about his journey.   "From where do you come, O Lord? Where
have you been traveling? What have you seen and heard? Is there any land you
have not visited?" asked the King.  Narada, his heart filled with joy at the
mention of the Jina, and his body tingling with excitement, replied, "O King, I
have been to Videha, a land cherished by the virtuous, adorned with the Meru,
Gaja, and Vijaya mountains, the very foundations of the Jina temples."  "There,
in the city of Pundarika, radiant with the brilliance of countless jewels, I
witnessed the initiation ceremony of Simandhara Swami. The sky was filled with
celestial chariots, adorned with banners and umbrellas, and the arrival of the
gods, a sight to behold. Just as the gods of this land celebrated the coronation
of Muni Suvrata on Mount Meru, so too did they celebrate his coronation there. I
heard the stories of Muni Suvrata, the Jina, just as they are told here, and I
saw them unfold before my very eyes. I saw countless temples, towering and vast,
adorned with precious jewels, where worship is offered without cease."

## Twenty-Third Chapter  O King! I have seen the Jain temples there. In the
Nandana forest, I have seen very beautiful Chaitya-alaya. Those temples have
many kinds of gem-studded bells and their seats are made of gold. ||13|| They
are adorned with golden pillars, radiating various kinds of rays, resembling the
sun-chariot, adorned with garlands and toranas, enriched with gem-studded
garlands, with vast Vedikas in their grounds, with walls made of excellent
Vaidurya gems, decorated with pictures of elephants, lions, etc., and whose
interiors are filled with divine women playing music. I have bowed to all the
Jina images in such Devaranya Chaitya-alayas. ||14-16||  I have circumambulated
Mount Meru, which is endowed with the brilliance of artificial images, and have
gone to the very high sky, piercing the cloud-sheet. ||17|| And I have bowed to
the many great, radiant Jina Chaitya-alayas on the peaks of the Kulachala
mountains. ||18|| O King! In all those Chaitya-alayas, I bow to all the great,
radiant, non-artificial images of the Jinas. ||19||  When Narada said this, King
Dasharatha, with folded hands and bowed head, uttered the words, "Salutations to
the Lord of Lords." ||20||  Then, prompted by Narada's signal, King Dasharatha,
with respect, had all the people removed from there by the gatekeeper. ||21||
Then, when they were alone, Narada said to King Dasharatha, the ruler of Kosala,
"O King! Listen attentively, I am telling you a good thing." ||22||  I went to
the peak of Trikuta mountain with great eagerness to pay my respects. There, I
bowed to the very beautiful Shantinath Bhagwan's Jinalaya. ||23||  Then, by the
influence of your merit, I heard a decision of Vibhishana and other ministers of
Lanka's king, Ravana. ||24||  There, a man named Sagarbuddhi, who had the
knowledge of auspicious omens, told Ravana that the son of King Dasharatha would
be the cause of your death. ||25||  Similarly, the daughter of King Janaka will
also be a cause in this. ||26||  Hearing this, Vibhishana, with a heavy heart,
decided... ||26||

474 In the Padma Purana, it is said that as long as the progeny of Dasharatha
and Janaka exist, Vibhishana will not kill them. He said this with great
determination. ||27|| He wandered the earth for a long time, but could not find
them. Then, his spies, who could assume any form at will, informed him about
their location, appearance, and other characteristics. ||28|| Being a sage, he
asked me, "O sage, do you know of any kings named Dasharatha and Janaka on
earth?" ||29|| In response, I said, "I will find out and tell you. O best of
men, I see his intentions as extremely cruel." ||30|| Therefore, O king, until
this Vibhishana does something to you, hide yourself somewhere secretly. ||31||
I have equal affection for those who are righteous and worship their gurus, and
especially for those like you. ||32|| Do what you think is right. May you be
well. I am now going to inform King Janaka of this matter. ||33|| Having said
this, Narada Muni, who had been greeted by King Dasharatha, flew up into the sky
and went towards Mithila with great speed. ||34|| He went there and informed
King Janaka of all this. It is right, because those who are worthy of respect
are dearer to him than life itself. ||35|| After Narada Muni left, King
Dasharatha, whose mind was filled with fear of death, summoned his minister,
Samudrahrdaya. ||36|| The best of speakers and devoted to his master, the
minister heard the great fear from the king's mouth. ||37|| He said, "O lord,
all creatures perform actions for the sake of life. Tell me, what is the use of
the kingdom of the three worlds for a lifeless creature?" ||38|| Therefore,
until I destroy the enemies, you should wander the earth in disguise, so that no
one recognizes you. ||39|| Upon hearing this, King Dasharatha entrusted his
treasury, country, city, and people to Samudrahrdaya and left the city. ||40||

475 The twenty-third chapter The minister, having examined the king well, had a
dummy made of Dasaratha. The dummy was so similar to the original that only by
its lack of consciousness could it be distinguished. [41] The dummy was filled
with a mixture of lac and other substances to simulate blood, and it was made as
soft as the body of a real being. [42] The dummy was seated on a fine throne in
the seventh storey of the palace, surrounded by all the usual paraphernalia.
[43] The minister and the artist who made the dummy both thought it was a real
king, and everyone else thought so too. Sometimes, even they were deceived. [44]
The same thing was done to Janaka. The minds of the wise are often superficial,
one surpassing the other. [45] Just as the moon and the sun hide themselves
during the rainy season, so too did these two kings, who knew the state of the
world, hide themselves during times of trouble. [46] Gautama Swami said to King
Shrenika, "O king of Magadha! Those kings who once lived in great palaces, who
were rich in material possessions, and who were served by the most beautiful
women, are now, like ordinary men, helpless and wandering the earth on foot.
Alas, the state of this world!" [47-48] Having decided this, what did that man,
who gave protection to all beings, not give to those who stood at the head of
the virtuous? [49] Vibhishana, having learned of their whereabouts from his
spies, sent many assassins to kill them. [50] These assassins, armed with
weapons, were cruel by nature, their bodies were invisible to the eye, and their
eyes were very restless. They roamed the city day and night. [51] These
assassins, being weak, were unable to enter the palace. When they were delayed
in their task, Vibhishana came himself. [52] He followed the sound of music and,
having entered the palace, found Dasaratha in the inner apartments. [53] This is
correct because the minister had thoroughly examined the king. [40] When the
king left, the minister had a dummy made of King Dasaratha's body. The dummy was
so similar to the original body that only by its lack of consciousness could it
be distinguished. [41] A mixture of lac and other substances was used to create
blood inside the dummy, and it was made as soft as the body of a real being.
[42] The dummy of the king was seated on a fine throne in the seventh storey of
the palace, surrounded by all the usual paraphernalia, just as before. [43] The
minister and the artist who made the dummy both thought it was a real king, and
everyone else thought so too. Sometimes, even they were deceived. [44] The same
thing was done to King Janaka. The minds of the wise are often superficial, one
surpassing the other. [45] Just as the moon and the sun hide themselves during

## English Translation:  **476**  The celestial being named Vidyudvilasita,
instigated by Vibhishana, severed the head of Dasharatha and presented it to his
master with great joy. ||54|| Having heard the cries from the inner palace,
Vibhishana cast the severed head into the ocean. He acted with the same cruelty
towards Janaka. ||55||  Then, considering himself successful and filled with
brotherly affection, Vibhishana, full of joy, went to Lanka. ||56|| Dasharatha's
entourage, after much lamentation, learned of the puppet's true nature and were
filled with wonder. ||57|| Vibhishana, upon reaching the city, performed
auspicious acts like charity and worship to pacify the inauspicious deeds.
||58||  His mind, once calmed, was filled with remorse due to the strange nature
of karma. He thought: ||59||  **Upajati-vrutta**  Driven by false fear, I have
needlessly killed those helpless earth-dwellers. Even a serpent, born from the
poison of the Ashvi, cannot harm Garuda. ||60|| Where is the earth-dweller with
his insignificant valor, and where is Ravana, with his valor equal to Indra's?
Where is the elephant, slow and intoxicated with pride, and where is the lion,
swift as the wind? ||61||  **Indravajra-vrutta**  Whatever happiness or sorrow a
man is destined to experience, he will inevitably receive it, guided by his
karma. ||62|| If someone truly understands the cause and effect, why wouldn't
they strive for their own liberation? By doing so, they will attain supreme
happiness in this world and liberation from the cycle of birth and death. ||63||
**Note:** The translation preserves the Jain terms like "Upajati-vrutta" and
"Indravajra-vrutta" as requested.

## Chapter Twenty-Three: The Story of Vibhishana's Misconduct  **477**  This
wisdom, which has been rendered foolish by the accidental separation of the two
kings' lives, is a result of my ignorance. It is true that the intellect of a
human being, due to poor education, is prone to act in ways that are not
beneficial. ||6||  This city of Lanka, situated in the middle of the ocean,
which pierces the netherworld, is capable of frightening even the gods. How then
can it be accessible to those who dwell on the earth? ||65||  "This act that I
have committed is entirely unworthy of me. I will never again engage in such
reckless behavior." With this thought, Vibhishana, radiant like the sun,
returned to his palace and indulged in his pleasures. ||66||  Thus ends the
twenty-third chapter of the Padmacharita, narrated by the sage Ravishena, which
describes the misconduct of Vibhishana.  **1. Gūḍhatva - Kh. || 2. Kh. B.
Pustakayoḥ Pāṭhaḥ.**  **Note:** The text uses the Jain term "naimittika"
(निमित्तज्ञानी) to describe someone who is influenced by external factors and
lacks true wisdom.

The Twenty-Fourth Chapter  "O Shrenik, I will tell you the wondrous story of
King Dasharatha's journey for the sake of protecting his life, listen to it with
wonder.  There is a city called Kautukamangal, adorned with a rampart like a
mountain, in the north.  There reigned a king named Shubhamati, who bore the
epithet 'Sārthaka'.  His wife was Prithushri, adorned with the ornaments of
feminine virtues.  They had two children, a daughter named Kekaya and a son
named Drona-megha, both of whom filled the space between heaven and earth with
their pure qualities.  Kekaya, with her beautiful limbs and excellent features,
shone brightly, having mastered all the arts.  She knew the three types of
dance: Angahārāshraya, Abhinayāshraya, and Vyāyāmika, along with their many sub-
types.  She was also well-versed in music, which is expressed through the
throat, head, and chest, and is composed of the seven notes: Shadja, Rishabha,
Gandhara, Madhyama, Panchama, Dhaivata, and Nishada.  It was accompanied by
three tempos: Drut, Madhy, and Vilambit, and had two types of talas: Asra and
Chaturasra.  It was composed of four types of varna: Sthayi, Sanchari, Arohi,
and Avarohi, and was set in four types of pada.  She was proficient in the three
languages: Sanskrit, Prakrit, and Shauraseni, which are characterized by their
use of nouns, verbs, prefixes, and particles.  There are eight types of jati:
Dhaivati, Ārshbhi, Shadja-Shadja, Udicya, Nishadini, Gandhari, Shadjakaikshi,
and Shadjamadyama.  Or, Gandharaudicya, Madhyamapanchami, Gandharapanchami,
Raktagandhari, Madhyama, etc."

## Chapter Twenty-Four  **479** The ten jātis are: Āndhrī, Madhyamodīcyā,
Karmāravī, Nandīnī, and Kaiśikī. The music that was composed with these eight or
ten jātis, along with the thirteen ornaments mentioned here and those to be
mentioned later, was excellent. ||14-15||  The four ornaments of the sthāyī pada
are: Prasannādi, Prasannānta, Madhyaprasāda, and Prasannādyavasāna. ||16||  The
six ornaments of the saṃcārī pada are: Nirvṛtta, Prasthita, Bindu, Preṅkholita,
Tāro-mandra, and Prasanna. ||17||  The ārohī pada has only one ornament,
Prasannādi, while the avarohī pada has two ornaments, Prasannānta and Kuḥara.
Thus, there are thirteen ornaments in total. She knew this excellent music well,
along with all its characteristics. ||18-19||  The four types of instruments
are: *tata* produced from the *tantri* (veena), *avanaddha* produced from the
*mṛdaṅga*, *śuṣira* produced from the *vaṃśa* (flute), and *ghana* produced from
the *tāla*. All these instruments have various variations. Just as she knew all
this, so too was there hardly anyone else who could match her knowledge.
||20-21||  The combination of song, dance, and instruments is called *nāṭya*.
The nine rasas are: Śṛṅgāra, Hāsya, Karuṇā, Vīra, Adbhuta, Bhayānaka, Raudra,
Bībhatsa, and Śānta. She, the young girl Kekayā, knew them all with their
various sub-categories and in their highest form. ||22-23||  The script that is
commonly used in one's own country is called *anuvṛtta*. The script that people
imagine according to their own symbols is called *vikṛta*. The script that is
used for writing about the *pratyanga* and other categories is called
*sāmayika*. The script that is created by using flowers and other objects in
place of letters is called *naimittika*. This script has many variations
depending on the region, such as Prācya, Madhyama, Yaudheya, Samādra, etc.
Kekayā knew all of them well. ||24-26||  There is an art called *uktikauśala*
which has many variations depending on the *sthāna* (location) and other
factors. The jātis are: *sthāna*, *svara*, *saṃskāra*, *vinyāsa*, *kāku*,
*samudāya*, *virāma*, *sāmānyābhihita*, *samānārthatva*, and *bhāṣā*. ||27-28||
The *sthāna* (location) is of three types: *uraḥ* (chest), *kaṇṭha* (throat),
and *śiraḥ* (head). The *svara* (tone) is the same as before, starting with
*ṣaḍja* and having seven variations. ||29||

## Chapter Twenty-Four  **481**  That which is cut with scissors etc. and is
connected with other parts is called **chhinna**. That which is cut and is
devoid of connection with other parts is called **achhinna**. ||42||  This
**patracchedyakriya** (art of cutting leaves) is performed on leaves, cloth,
gold etc. and is of two types: **sthira** (stable) and **chanchal** (mobile).
The beautiful Kekaya had mastered this art. ||43||  The art of garland making is
of four types: **ardra** (moist), **shushka** (dry), **tadundmukta** (released
from that) and **mishra** (mixed). The garland made from fresh flowers etc. is
called **ardra**. The one made from dry leaves etc. is called **shushka**. The
one made from rice husk or jaw etc. is called **tadundmukta**. And the one made
from a mixture of all three is called **mishra**. ||44-45||  This garland making
art is associated with various aspects like **ranprabodhan** (awakening of war),
**vyuhsangyog** (combination of formations) etc. The wise Kekaya was well-versed
in all these aspects. ||46||  **Yoni dravya** (source material), **adhiṣṭhāna**
(base), **rasa** (taste), **virya** (potency), **kalpana** (imagination),
**parikarma** (process), **guna-dosha** (qualities and defects) knowledge and
**kaushala** (skill) are the components of **gandhayोजना** (art of fragrance
creation). **Tagara** (sandalwood) etc. are the **yoni dravya** from which
fragrant substances are created. The base of incense sticks etc. is called
**adhiṣṭhāna**. **Kashaya** (astringent), **madhura** (sweet), **tikta**
(bitter), **katu** (pungent) and **amla** (sour) are the five types of **rasa**
which need to be carefully determined in fragrant substances. ||47-49||  The
**virya** of substances is of two types: **shita** (cold) and **ushna** (hot).
**Kalpana** is the combination of suitable and unsuitable substances. ||50||
**Parikarma** includes processes like **sneha** (oiling), **shodhan**
(purification) and **kshalan** (washing). **Guna-dosha** knowledge is the
understanding of qualities and defects. **Kaushala** is the knowledge of the
uniqueness of external and internal substances. ||51||  This art of
**gandhayोजना** is associated with two aspects: **svatantr** (independent) and
**anugata** (dependent). Kekaya was well-versed in all these aspects. ||52||
There are five types of food items: **bhakṣya** (eatable), **bhojya** (edible),
**peya** (drinkable), **lehya** (lickable) and **chushya** (suctable). Among
these, **bhakṣya** is eaten for taste and is of two types: **kṛtrima**
(artificial) and **akṛtrima** (natural). ||53||  **Bhojya** is eaten to satisfy
hunger and is of two types: **mukhya** (main) and **sadhaka** (supplementary).
**Odan** (rice), **roti** (bread) etc. are **mukhya bhojya**. **Lappsi** (sweet
porridge), **dal** (lentils), **shak** (vegetables) etc. are **sadhaka bhojya**.
||54||  **Peeya** is of three types: **shityoga** (sherbet), **jala** (water)
and **madya** (wine). **Lehya** is of three types: **raga** (sweet), **khaṇḍa**
(sugar candy) and **valehya** (lickable). **Chushya** is of two types:
**kṛtrima** (artificial) and **akṛtrima** (natural). ||55||

## English Translation:  482 In the Padma Purana, the knowledge of taste is
described as being associated with digestion, cutting, heating, and cooling,
etc. Kekaya possessed this beautiful knowledge. ||56|| She knew well the
characteristics of gems like diamond, pearl, sapphire, gold, silver, weapons,
clothes, conch shells, etc. ||57|| She was skilled in weaving, dyeing clothes in
various colors, and other such arts with great beauty and excellence. ||58|| She
was very knowledgeable in making various tools from iron, teeth, lac, alkali,
stone, thread, etc. ||59|| There are four types of measurement based on the
differences in the object, place, weight, and time. Among these, the measurement
of the object is called "meya" and is differentiated based on the differences in
length, width, etc. ||60|| The measurement of place is called "desh" and is
measured in "vitasti" (span), etc. The measurement of weight is called "tula"
and is measured in "pal" (weight), etc. The measurement of time is called "kal"
and is measured in "samaya" (time), etc. ||61|| This measurement is generated
from ascent, circumference, diagonal, and action. She knew all of this well.
||62|| She was also knowledgeable in the arts of agriculture, treasure hunting,
identifying precious stones, business practices, and the science of life, all in
a special way. ||63|| She was well-versed in the treatment of humans, elephants,
cows, horses, etc., with knowledge of their causes and other aspects. ||64||
There are three types of fainting: caused by illusion, pain, or magic, and by
spells and medicines. She knew all of this well. ||65|| She was well-versed in
the various doctrines created by hypocrites, including their character and
various aspects. ||66|| There are four types of play: based on action, tools,
speech, and artistic skill. Action is the play that originates from the body.
||67|| Playing with balls, etc., is considered a tool. Speech play is the use of
various beautiful words. ||68|| Gambling, etc., is considered artistic skill.
She was an expert in all these types of play. ||69||

The twenty-fourth chapter 483 The world is said to be of two kinds, based on the
distinction between the dependent and the support. The living beings and the
non-living beings are the dependents, and the earth, etc., are their supports.
|| 70 || In this world, there is the origin, existence, and destruction of
various forms of life. To know this is called Lokajñāna (knowledge of the
world), which is very difficult to attain. || 71 || This world exists naturally
in various forms, such as mountains, earth, islands, and countries. Kekaya had
the best knowledge of this. || 72 || 1 The art of massage is of two types: one
is Karma-saṁśraya (dependent on karma) and the other is Śayyopacārika (related
to the bed). There are four types of Karma-saṁśraya, as they provide comfort to
the skin, flesh, bones, and mind. Some massages provide comfort only to the
skin, some to the skin and flesh, some to the skin, flesh, and bones, and some
to all four: skin, flesh, bones, and mind. Besides these, there are other types:
contact, holding, eating, moving, striking, breaking, piercing, pressing, and
splitting. Furthermore, there are three types based on softness, medium, and
firmness. || 73-75 || The massage that provides comfort only to the skin is
called soft or delicate. The one that provides comfort to the skin and flesh is
called medium, and the one that provides comfort to the skin, flesh, and bones
is called firm. When music is added to it, it becomes known as mind-comforting
massage. || 76 || This art of massage also has the following drawbacks:
reversing the growth of hair on the body, pressing too hard on areas without
flesh, hair pulling, amazing, corruptly obtained, going astray, overeating,
being ordered to do something, excessive, and being the opposite of sleep. The
delicate massage that is free from these drawbacks, applied in the right place,
and done with knowledge of the intention, is very beautiful. || 77-79 || The
massage that is done with various instruments, such as cushions, is called
Śayyopacārika, which provides comfort to the mind. || 80 || This art of massage,
which is related to the limbs and their parts, was known to that girl in a way
that no other woman knew. || 81 || Bathing, braiding the hair, and perfuming
them are the arts of body-culture and dressing. So 1. Cāsa-kha., Vāsa ja. 2.

This maiden was also well aware of this. ||82|| Thus, adorned with beautiful
character and the excellent ornament of humility, she possessed all the arts
that captivated the minds of people. ||83|| Her fame, born of the qualities of
art, shone uniquely in the three worlds, attracting the minds of all. ||84||
King, what more need be said? Briefly, hear this: even in a hundred years, it
would be impossible to describe her form. ||85|| Her father thought, "Who could
be a suitable groom for her? It would be good if she chooses her own husband."
||86|| With this decision, he gathered all the kings of the earth, including
Harivahana, for her swayamvara. These kings were adorned with various kinds of
gestures and expressions even before the swayamvara. ||87|| King Dasharatha,
accompanied by King Janaka, arrived there. Although King Dasharatha was in
simple attire, he overshadowed all the other kings present with his brilliance.
||88|| The usher was introducing the generous kings seated on well-decorated
platforms, and the virtuous maiden, skilled in reading human character, was
going around, observing each king. Finally, she placed her garland of blue
lotuses, symbolizing her gaze, around Dasharatha's neck. ||89-90|| Just as a
swan is approached by a goose amidst a flock of geese, so this maiden, with her
graceful movements, approached King Dasharatha amidst the assembly of kings.
||91|| She had already accepted Dasharatha with the garland of emotions, and the
garland of wealth she placed on him was a repetition, as per social custom.
||92|| In that pavilion, many kings, with happy hearts, exclaimed, "Oh! This
excellent maiden has chosen a worthy and unparalleled husband." ||93|| And some
kings, out of extreme arrogance, became enraged and created a great commotion.
||94|| They said, "Leaving us, who are born in renowned lineages and possess
great wealth, this wicked maiden has chosen one whose lineage and character are
unknown. ||95||

Chapter Twenty-Four  485. "Seize this foreign woman, whose intentions are evil.
Grab her by the hair and drag her away forcefully, you wicked girl!" ||17||
Having said this, the kings, led by Dasharatha, all armed and ready, marched
towards him, their hearts filled with rage. ||98||  Then, overwhelmed with fear,
Shubhamati, the girl's father, spoke to Dasharatha, "O noble one! While I hold
back these enraged kings, you take the girl and hide her somewhere. The
knowledge of time is the supreme principle in all strategies." ||99-100||
Hearing this, Dasharatha, the wise and valiant king, smiled and said, "Be at
ease, my friend. See how they flee in fear!" ||101||  With these words, he
mounted his chariot, drawn by powerful horses, and became as terrifying as the
midday sun in autumn. ||102||  Kekaya quickly dismounted from the chariot and,
taking the reins and whip, stood in the battlefield, her courage unwavering.
||103||  She said, "My lord, command me. Whom shall I attack? Death is eager to
embrace whom today?" ||104||  Dasharatha replied, "What good is killing these
petty kings? I will strike down the head of this army, the leader of these men.
O wise and beloved one, drive the chariot towards the one with the white
umbrella, shining like the moon." ||105-106||  Following his command, she drove
the chariot forward, its white umbrella raised high, its great banner waving in
the wind. ||107||  The flames of the chariot, like the blazing light of the
banner, consumed thousands of warriors like moths drawn to a flame. ||108||  The
kings, struck by the arrows released from Dasharatha's chariot, fled in all
directions, trampling over each other in their panic. ||109||  Then, Hem Prabha,
seeing the kings defeated and ashamed, rallied them and urged them to attack
Dasharatha's chariot once more. ||110||

486 Padma Purana Many kings surrounded by horses, chariots, elephants and foot
soldiers, roaring like lions and moving with a large group, aimed their tomars,
arrows, nooses, chakras and gold weapons at the single king Dasharatha with
great eagerness. ||111-112|| It was amazing that King Dasharatha, even though he
was in a single chariot, was Dasharatha, and at that time he was becoming a
hundred-charioted or countless-charioted by his prowess. ||113|| The king
Dasharatha, who held a circular bow, pierced the weapons of the enemies with
arrows whose drawing and holding were not known. ||114|| He made the Hemprabha,
whose flag and umbrella had been cut and fallen down and whose vehicle was
exhausted and very anxious, chariotless in a moment with arrows shining like
gold. ||115|| Then Hemprabha, whose mind was filled with fear, mounted another
chariot and fled quickly, tarnishing his glory. ||116|| King Dasharatha pierced
the enemies and weapons and protected himself and his wife. The work that one
Dasharatha did at that time was worthy of an infinite chariot. ||117|| Seeing
the lion-like Dasharatha, who was shaking his arrow-like hair, the deer-like
warriors fled in all eight directions. ||118|| At that time, this loud sound was
rising in both his and the enemy's army: "Oh! What amazing power this man has!
And what a miracle this girl has done!" ||119|| People could recognize King
Dasharatha, who was holding high his prowess, only by the victory cry proclaimed
by the devotees or by his unparalleled power. ||120|| Then King Dasharatha took
the hand of the girl in the city called Kautukamangal, where others had
performed auspicious ceremonies and rituals. ||121|| After that, King Dasharatha
went to Ayodhya and King Janaka went to Mithilapuri, whose wedding celebration
was held with great wealth and splendor. ||122|| There, the relatives filled
with joy performed the rebirth festival and the re-coronation of King Dasharatha
with great splendor. ||123|| The virtuous King Dasharatha, who was free from all
kinds of fear and whose orders were considered sacred by all, was playing in
Ayodhya like Indra in heaven. ||124||

487 In the twenty-fourth chapter, the king Dasaratha addressed Kekaya, who was
seated in the presence of his other wives and kings, saying, "O fair-faced one,
O beloved, tell me what you desire, I will fulfill it. I am very happy today."
If you had not driven the chariot with great skill at that time, how could I
have conquered the angry group of enemies who had risen together?   If the
charioteer Arun had not been there, how could the sun, pervading the entire
world, have destroyed the darkness?   Kekaya, whose face was bowed down under
the weight of shame born from receiving the boon, said repeatedly, "O lord, let
my request be a trust with you. When I ask, you will give it without saying
anything."  As soon as Kekaya said this, King Dasaratha, whose face was like the
full moon, and who was a rival to the moon god, said, "O beloved, O broad-hipped
one, O gentle-complexioned one, O possessor of three-colored, very beautiful,
clear and large eyes, let it be so."  The king Dasaratha said to the others,
"Oh! This Kekaya, born in a great family, skilled in the arts, and endowed with
all enjoyments, is truly wise in her policy, that she has made her request a
trust."  Thinking that this virtuous lady will slowly consider and ask for some
desired good thing, all her loved ones at that time attained the highest joy.
Gautama Swami says to Srenic, "O king! I have, according to my intelligence,
made this king for you.

elaborate? Those with bad conduct experience extreme suffering, while those with
good conduct, shining like the sun, experience happiness. ||135|| Thus ends the
twenty-fourth chapter of the Padma Charita, narrated by the Acharya known as
Ravishena, titled "The Gift of Kekaya." ||24||  The story of Dasharatha's good
conduct has been told. Now listen to the account of the birth of the great
humans who illuminated their noble lineage. ||134|| There is no need for
elaboration to understand the story of the three worlds. Therefore, I will

The twenty-fifth chapter:  The queen Aparajita, sleeping peacefully in her
palace, on a bed adorned with a lake of shining jewels, saw wondrous dreams in
the last watch of the night, dreams that foretold the birth of a great man. She
saw these dreams as vividly as if she were awake.   In the first dream, she saw
a white elephant, in the second a lion, in the third the sun, and in the fourth
the moon. Upon seeing these, she awoke to the auspicious sounds of trumpets.
Her mind filled with wonder, Aparajita performed her morning rituals. As the
world was illuminated by the sun's rays, she went to her husband, her heart
filled with anxiety to know the meaning of her dreams. She was accompanied by
her friends, and she adorned the royal throne.   With a slight bow, Aparajita
joined her hands and recounted her dreams to her husband, who listened
attentively.   Then, King Dasharatha, the seer of all knowledge, standing amidst
the assembly of wise men, revealed the meaning of the dreams. He said, "My dear,
the reason for your wonder is that you will give birth to a son who will destroy
all enemies, both internal and external."  Upon hearing this, Aparajita was
filled with joy. She touched her belly and her lotus-like face was adorned with
a gentle smile.   With a pure heart, Aparajita, along with her delighted
husband, performed grand worship at the Jain temples.   From that day forward,
her beauty increased, and though her heart was filled with great strength, she
also experienced a profound peace.   Later, the beautiful queen Sumitra also had
dreams. She was astonished and her body trembled with excitement, her dreams
filled with auspicious meaning.

490 Padma Purana She saw that Lakshmi and Kirti were respectfully anointing the
lion king with kalashas, which had lotuses placed on their mouths and were
filled with beautiful water. ||13|| Then she saw that she herself was standing
on the peak of a high mountain, looking at the vast earth adorned with the
ocean-like girdle. ||14|| After that, she saw a beautiful, rotating wheel,
shining with radiant rays, resembling the sun, studded with various gems. ||15||
Seeing these dreams, she woke up to the sound of auspicious musical instruments.
Then, with great humility, she went and told her husband the news of her dream
in very sweet words. ||16|| In response, King Dasharatha said, "O beloved, you
will have a son who will be the head of the age, who will destroy the group of
enemies, who will be of great brilliance, and who will be the bearer of
wonderful deeds." ||17|| With her mind filled with joy at her husband's words,
Queen Sumitra went to her place. At that time, she was seeing the entire world
as if it were located below. ||18|| Then, when the time was complete, just as
the eastern direction gives birth to the full moon, Queen Aparajita gave birth
to a radiant son. ||19|| When King Dasharatha sat down to give wealth to those
who announced this fortune-increasing event, he was left with only umbrellas,
whisks, and clothes, as he had given away everything else in charity. ||20|| All
the brothers and relatives celebrated this great birth with great pomp. It was
such a birth celebration that the whole world went mad with joy. ||21|| They
named this son, who had the complexion of the midday sun, whose chest was
embraced by Lakshmi, and whose eyes were like lotuses, Padma. ||22|| Then, just
as the land of gems, i.e., the mine, gives birth to a precious gem endowed with
qualities like shade, etc., Sumitra gave birth to a son who was the bearer of
supreme radiance. ||23|| As if researching the birth celebration of Padma, the
relatives also celebrated his birth with great pomp. ||24|| Thousands of
calamities arose in the cities of the enemies, indicating misfortune, and
thousands of auspicious signs appeared in the cities of the relatives,
indicating wealth. ||25||

## The Twenty-Fifth Canto  **26.**  A son, whose brilliance resembled the heart
of a full-blown blue lotus, who floated in a sea of radiance, and who was
adorned with many auspicious marks, was born to Lakshmana and his wife. His
parents named him Lakshmana.  **27-28.**  The two boys were exceedingly
beautiful. Their lips were red like coral, their hands and feet were the color
of red lotuses, and their movements were captivating. Their touch was as soft as
butter, and they possessed a natural fragrance.  Playing their childish games,
they stole the hearts of all who saw them.  **29.**  Anointed with sandalwood
paste and adorned with saffron tilak on their foreheads, they resembled
mountains of silver, infused with the essence of gold.  **30.**  Bound by the
love that had grown over countless lifetimes, they were each other's inheritors.
They were cherished by all their relatives within the palace.  **31.**  When
they spoke, it was as if they were vomiting nectar. When they looked at someone,
it was as if they were anointing the world with a blissful ointment.  **32.**
When they were called, they seemed to tear through poverty itself. They
satisfied the hearts of all, according to their own desires.  **33.**  Their
very presence seemed to bring blessings and prosperity.  Protected by their
guardians, the two princes roamed the city, enjoying their carefree games.
**34.**  Just as Vijaya and Triprishtha, the names of Balabhadra and Narayana,
had been given before, so too were these two princes endowed with similar
qualities.  **35.**  Later, Kekaya gave birth to a son, whose form was divine
and who was destined for great fortune. He was named Bharata in the world.
**36.**  Subsequently, Supribha gave birth to a beautiful son, whose fame as
Shatrughna still echoes throughout the world.  **37.**  Aparajita named her son
Bala, after the lotus, and Sumitra, with great desire, named her son Hari.
**38.**  Kekaya, seeing that the name Bharata was associated with the universal
emperor, declared her son to be half-emperor.  **39.**  Supribha, hearing the
name Chakravarti (emperor), declared that her son was worthy of the name
Shatrughna.

492 In the Padma Purana, the four Kumaras were as deep as the ocean, as
harmonious as the right paths, and as generous as the directions. ||40|| Seeing
the Kumaras fit for learning, their father, Dasaratha, anxiously considered a
suitable teacher. ||41|| There was a beautiful city called Kampilya, where a
Brahmin named Shikhi lived. He had a daughter named Ishu. ||42|| They had a son
named Air, who, due to excessive pampering, became very unruly. His actions were
the cause of thousands of reproaches. ||43|| Earning wealth, acquiring
knowledge, and accumulating virtue, although within the control of man, are
often achieved in foreign lands. ||44|| Thinking thus, his parents, filled with
sorrow, expelled him from home. He went to the city of Rajagriha, wearing only
two garments, in a state of misery. ||45|| There was a learned man named
Vaivasvata, who was highly skilled in archery and had a thousand disciples who
were diligent in their studies. ||46|| Air approached him and learned archery
according to the proper method. In a short time, he became more skilled than all
his thousand disciples. ||47|| The king of Rajagriha heard that Vaivasvata had
made a foreign boy more skilled than his own sons. He was filled with anger upon
learning this. ||48|| Hearing the king's anger, Vaivasvata, the teacher of
archery, instructed Air, "You should appear foolish before the king." ||49||
Then the king, saying, "I will test the education of all your disciples,"
summoned Vaivasvata and his disciples. ||50|| Then the king had all the
disciples shoot arrows in turn, and they all hit the target as they should.
||51|| Then he had Air shoot arrows, and he shot them in such a way that the
king considered him foolish. ||52|| When the king realized that everyone had
been deceived, he sent Air away. The teacher of archery returned to his own
abode, surrounded by his disciples. ||53||  When Kekaya named his son
Chakravarti, I thought, "Why shouldn't I name my son something even greater?"
With this thought, he named his son Shatrughna after the Lord. ||39||

The Twenty-Fifth Chapter  Having accepted the daughter of Vaivasvata as his
wife, with the consent of his Guru, he fled at night and reached the city of
Dasharatha. [54] He displayed his skills in the forest and was presented to the
king. The king, pleased with him, entrusted his sons to him. [55] Just as the
image of the moon expands in clear ponds, so too did the skills of Aira expand
in his disciples. [56] Similarly, with the attainment of other Gurus, other
knowledge also became illuminated in them, just as hidden gems become
illuminated when the lid is removed. [57] Seeing the excellence of their
knowledge in all the scriptures, the king, whose heart was filled with joy due
to the conduct, humility, and generous actions of his sons, was greatly pleased.
He honored the Gurus with great wealth, exceeding their desires, being renowned
for his generosity and possessing knowledge of the qualities and wisdom of the
Gurus. [58]  Gautama Swami says, "O King! A little knowledge attained by some
men becomes excellent, some remain the same, and some, due to the disparity of
their actions, do not even retain what they have attained. This is because the
group of rays of the sun, upon reaching the shore of the crystal mountain,
expands greatly, remains the same in some places, and is completely destroyed in
places of darkness." [59]  Thus ends the Twenty-Fifth Chapter of the
Padmacharita, narrated by the sage Ravishena, which describes the birth of Rama
and his four brothers. [25]

What is the gift desired? The gift given by the king of the demons. The battle
of giving lasted for a long time, and after giving the order, he again did.
Giving the news of the counter-force. Giving the seven virtues. Giving to
Suvrata, he showed the Narmada with foam-covered waves. He gives liberation. He
gave the knowledge of the Ashali. They saw, struck with wonder. They saw him,
the king of the people. With teeth-bitten lower lip, bound. Row of teeth, white-
shadowed. Those very teeth, which are peaceful-toothed, having seen the clearly-
seen king of the teeth, the great circle, the elephant smells him, as long as he
holds the supreme by him. Holding the self as void. Wearing a garland on his
chest. He said, "Again, O Bhadra!" He said, "O fire of desires!" By suppression,
the beating of the wicked. The Jinas, being told of compassion. The burning coal
of separation from the beloved. The beloved told, as long as. 142 154 354 231
111 381 446 228 222 278 164 57  142 446 3 294 140 198 446 341 296 273 225 23 326
444 445 270 20 Born of a poor family, always in a poor belly. By pure vision.
309 302 By the fuel of vision, having become beyond the reach of vision. 325 By
vision, by touch, by anger. 229 Shown by these two, on the back. Shown, even
then, in that. 370 In the middle of the mirror. 144 465 153 Even though there is
a mirror, a blade of grass is distinct. 403 The order of the first letters of
the verses. Like a leaf, with pride. Even in the leaf, fear of movement.
Dashagriva in vain. Praise. Dashagriva is the essence. To Dashagriva, Sugriva.
With Dashagriva, those. Dashagriva, then, his son. In those ten divisions, thus.
On the tenth day, from that day, the tenth, the tenth part. By the one released
from the ten mouths. 35 199 432 233 By the mouth of Dashagriva. 267 By the ten-
mouthed one, by him, I. 170 Dashagriva, even those arrows. 292 By the ten
streams released. 485 One hundred more, by him. The birth of Dashaanan. Whatever
mouth of Dashaanan. The story of the ten-mouthed one, to him. It is the duty of
the ten-mouthed one. By the ten-mouthed one, then, he was driven. The ten-
mouthed one, with many wives. 84 6 267 203 212 210 336 185 346 275 As in a
burning house. 247 Pomegranate, betel nut, and kol. 103 The giver, the enjoyer,
the one who stands, the doer. 317 Even though the gift is condemned, it goes.
311 152 309 179 190 328 6 The ten-mouthed one, even though he conquered the
enemy. With bitten lower lip, he pulled. Like a generous one being burned. By
the gift, the cloud of desires. By the gift, they resort. The child, the joy of
his own people. 20 377 160 160 214 176 179 Like a forest fire, by him. The class
of servants, vast wealth. By the Digambara, the statement. The pillar of
Dignaga's bondage. At the end of the day, the end of the Tatpurusha. In the
three days that have passed. 451 371 340  These three days are not mine. Then,
on that day, the disc. The touch of the sun's hand. The horses of the sun's
chariot. Made joyful with divine garlands. Covered with a divine garment. The
direction in which the sun went. In the direction of Kishkupura, then. All
directions were darkened. By destiny, you have resorted to enlightenment. To
those who are the cause of increase by destiny. He attained the Jain initiation.
By taking initiation, by him. The initiation of Indrajeet and others. If you
choose this initiation. The initiation of the son of the wind. Having performed
austerities for a long time. Long, hot breath. To the poor, blind, and people.
The king, the owner of the dinar. What else with the poor here? For sorrow goes
to destruction. By the speech that has come out of sorrow. The sorrow-stricken
grove, without relatives. The self-proof of sorrow. Overwhelmed by the burden of
sorrow. By sorrow, the state of death. The difficult entry of the unrighteous.
By bad nature, the mother-in-law. By the wicked, how by him. Broken, with a foul
body. By nature, in foulness. Rare, in the existence of beings. Bad clothes,
unfortunate, rough. Difficult, even for Ravana. Those who do not give up evil
deeds. Those who are attached to evil deeds, the supreme. The wicked, of the
evil deed, now. 523 342 199 173 11 51 22 129 201 266 385 490 304 81 8 452 8 304

534 In the Padma Purana 118 155 78 316 367 188 The sound of the conch shell also
His mandala revolves eternally, equal to the land of enjoyment. 407 My
understanding of the object. 54 Without enjoyment, the limbs do not. 158
According to the virtuous Suvratanathas, the food is divided into two, like
gruel. 48.1 By the collision of the intoxicated elephants 284 Oh, good people,
for what reason 158 Wandering where the wind has crushed the intoxicated
elephant 102 Mounted on the intoxicated elephant- 184 Wander among the beasts
118 By whom the earth-bearing mountain is wandered like an intoxicated elephant.
419 Even the elephants of that 28 Embraced by the swarm of bees- 108 Intoxicated
by the taste of honey 102 Subtle and dark like the bees The great one is not
intoxicated- 147 The bee, tired of wandering, 338 The dust from my feet, O sage
211 This chariot of mine will wander The lord of the city of Mathura, having
lost the path, 483 Seeing his brother killed in Mathura 145 With his cheeks wet
with passion 407 Along with his brothers there Of the one whose eyes are
intoxicated by Madana, 341 Wandering through the whole world, 228 That
intoxicated woman, wandering in the swarm of intoxicated bees, 484 Even a mere
touch of these intoxicated by liquor 160 The physician intoxicated with passion
347 As if making eyebrow movements 174 Even this sight of mine 222 Just by the
movement of the eyebrows 212 Just by the movement of the eyebrows 126 On the
sword blade smeared with honey From honey, intoxication, meat [and] From honey,
meat, and liquor- 321 Attached to the nectar of the flowers Those whose speech
drips with honey, the intoxicated by the nectar- 215 In the middle of them, the
ten-necked one 325 Looking at the middle part 262 Auspicious is what was done
before 110 Auspicious is what was served by the elders 110 In the middle of the
women with braids 231 And for fear of destroying the auspicious 368 In the
middle of this ocean 101 Auspicious things were used 123 Like the midday sun 112
Holding the pillar in the middle of the day 128 Seated on the couches, the
people 484 The minds of the city women- 193 Placed in the jewel-studded 106
Having attained the human state 383 Like the jewel trees sprouting 103 Having
attained the human state 325 Adorned with Indra's bow 462 Having attained the
human state - 23 The adornment of the shaved garland Human enjoyment and heaven
387 Only those who are human Seeing even that beautiful one 173 The arrow of
Manobhava 271 This is the desire of hundreds of desires 340 His mind is the
ketaki flower 407 Ascending the beautiful one by nature 49 With beautiful
celestial gardens 169 And the ministers, indeed, constantly 340 Endowed with the
council of ministers 453 Now the unfortunate one's efforts 274 Like the Mandara
with the gentle wind 295 The arrival of the gentle Mandodari 358 I think even
Indra 197 I think this one is like us 428 Like the peacock's neck 392 This news
is known to me 174 Even I have the worry of a daughter 389 The destruction of
the Maruts 263 Having joined the palms, the Maruts 12 Free from dirt and sweat
17 And my fame is tarnished 279 Mallika and Suvratanatha 424 With the tip of the
tail on the head 387 With the great sound of the musical instrument 486 The
