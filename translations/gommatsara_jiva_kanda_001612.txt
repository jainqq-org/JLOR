 PUBLISHER'S NOTE. It is with a heavy heart, and a palsied pen that I have
laboured to write these few lines. "The Sacred Books of the Jainas" reminds me
of the passing away of my very dear friend Kumar Devendra Prasada Jaina, who
founded the above "Series " and published in 1917, its first volume," Dravya
Samgraha", a monumental work on Jaina Philosophy by Acharya Shri Nemichandra
Siddhant Chakravarti, translated and edited by Mr. Sarat Chandra Ghoshal, M. A.,
B. L., Saraswati, Kavya-Tirtha, Vidya Bhushan, Bharati, with a learned
Introduction covering 48 pages, and exhaustive commentaries. The original text
consists of 58 verses only, but their translation, and commentaries cover 123
pages of Royal Size. Dear departed Devendra was a born publisher. The
publication of the highest authoritative works of Jaina Acharyas for the glory
of Jainism and for the benefit of Humanity was the one aim and ambition of his
life, for which he sacrificed his worldly prosperity, his College career, and
even his life. With his boundless enthusiasm, single-minded devotion, and
selfless exertions, he succeeded in securing the co-operation of scholars of
exceptionally high attainments, like Professor A. Chakravarti of the Presidency
College, Madras, and Mr. J. L. Jaini, M. A., (Oxon.) Bar-at-law, Judge, High
Court, Indore. Mr. J. L. Jaini, M. A., M.R.A.S., then Chief Justice of Indore.
translated and edited the Tattwarthadhigama Sutra, which he has very
appropriately called the Jaina Bible, and followed up by under-taking the
translation with commentaries of Gommatsara, the Encyclopaedia of Jain
Philosophy. This work was begun by him in the Chaturmasa, the rainy season, of
1927, when Jaina Dharma Bhushana Brahmachari Sital Prasadaji stayed with him,
and helped him. The printing was commenced in the rainy weather of 1926, when
Brahmachariji decided to stay at Ajitashram and supervise the work. LLC.

 VII The whole text of this work, and of Part 1 of Karma Kanda had been printed
off in March 1927. The stock of feather-weight paper which was being used for
the work was completely exhausted before the Index, etc. and title pages could
be printed. The mills also had no more such paper left in stock. An order was
placed with them to manufacture such paper afresh, and thus an unexpected delay
has been occasioned in the publication of Gommatasara. This sudden breakdown was
an extremely unfortunate circumstance. The intense poignancy of this mishap was
felt on the sudden receipt of a wire from Indore announcing the death of Mr. J.
L. Jaini. Alas, this great master of Jaina Philosophy could not live to see the
greatest monumental work of his life in the shape of a bound volume. It saddens
my heart so much, when the discussions he had with me in May last, as to the
manner and quality of the binding come to my mind. This is my first venture as a
publisher; and the responsibility has been forced upon me by the miserable
decree of Fate which has taken away from us the Founder-Publisher of the Sacred
Books of the Jainas, and the incomparable author of two of the most authentic,
ancient, and standard works of Jaina Philosophy. The defects, for which I am
responsible, are too many to escape notice. I have no justification to plead in
self-defence. I confess my short-comings, and throw myself on the indulgence of
the benevolent readers of this volume. The depth and vastness of the knowledge
displayed here-in, and the thorough and exhaustive analysis of the endless
varieties of mental vibrations is amazing and fascinating indeed. Gommatsara
will, I hope, be found to be a real treat by the scholar, the seeker after
truth, the Jnani and the Dhyani, and will, for the Right Believer, prove a
practical guide to the path of Liberation. AJITASHRAM, LUCKNOW :-) November 30,
1927. AJIT PRASADA,

 PREFACE. My "Outlines of Jainism" was published by the Cambridge Uni. versity
Press for the Jaina Literature Society, London, in 1916, in advance of a series
designed to consist principally, but not exclusively, of translations from
authoritative texts. The aim was to put the whole Jaina Canon in brief on one
bookshelf. In pursuance of this idea, which I brought back with me from Oxford
and London in 1910 and 1913, the Jaina sacred texts began to be translated. My
friend, the late Kumar Devendra Prasada was in constant consultation with me.
With his most enthusiastic and inimitable love for the work, he published some
Jaina works and then started the Sacred Books of the Jaina Series, with the
splendid First Volume of Dravya Sangraha, edited by Mr. S. C. Ghosal in 1916. My
Tattvartha Sutra followed as the Second Volume in 1920, The learned Prof. A.
Chakravarti gave us the Third Volume as Panchasti Kaya at the end of the same
year. Purushartha Siddhyupaya, with translation and Commentaries was prepared by
my learned brother Pandit Ajit Prasada, of Ajitashram Lucknow; and the Indian
Press of Allahabad had printed about half the book when the Kumar suddenly died.
On the 14th December 1920 Kumar Devendra Prasada wrote to me, saying "Volume V
be your Gommatasara." I take this as a testamentary wish of a beloved soul and
therefore publish this translation as Volume Fifth of the Sacred Books of the
Jainas. Volume Fourth, Purushartha Siddyupaya is also in Press.

 This translation of Gommatasara Jivakanda was made in the rainy season of 1917
at Indore. In 1918, I fell most seriously-ill with influenza and double
pneumonia, and only in 1919 it became for the manuscript to begin to be
published at the instance of the late lamented Kumar Devendra Prasada of Arrah,
in the Jaina Gazette. Madras. After 79 gathas had been published, it was decided
not to publish it in this periodical fashion, but to print it as a book at once.
On 17th April 1921, to the great loss of the cause of publication of Jaina
Literature, the young, energetic and talented Kumar died. The work of
publication was postponed. In 1922, I wanted to undertake to publish it myself
but I found that the late Kumar had mislaid or lost Gathas 79 to 250. My health
and many official duties forbade a re-translation of the Gathas myself;
therefore under my supervision, I had the work done by kind and obliging
friends. Jaina Dharma Bhushana Brahmachari Sital Prasada did it in 1923 with the
help of the brilliant Scholar and Sanskrit Professor Hira Lall Jain, M.A., LL.
B.. of the Government College, Amraoti. The gap in the Ms. being thus filled, it
was once more complete. The Devendra Printing Press at Madras was being started
by Mr. C. S. Mallinath, the enthusiastic Editor of the Jaina Gazette, and he
wanted to publish the Ms. My learned brother Professor A. Chakravarti, M. A., I.
E. S. of the Presidency College, Madras, kindly undertook to help Brahmachariji
if he went to Madras to supervise the publication. This was in 1924. I was ill
again from June 1924 to February 1925. On my recovery I took up the question
once more. But owing to Antaraya (obstructive) Karma, a serious attack of
diabetic Coma prostrated me on almost a death-bed from December 1925. On my
return home from Hospital in May 1926 I made up my mind to publish this and my
other unpublished Manuscripts, anyhow. Brahmachariji readily, promptly and
almost eagerly came up with his generous help of time and trouble. My learned
and revered brother Pandit Ajit Prasada, M. A., LL. B., late Government Pleader
of Lucknow, agreed to collaborate. The famous Newal Kishore Press, Lucknow
undertook the publication. Thus being equipped with men and munition for this
warfare against deadly ignorance and superstition, I bade Brahmachariji Godspeed
to Lucknow in July 1926. When the book was in Press, Brahmachariji got the last
Gathas 79 to 250 also from Arrah in August 1926, after such trouble in replacing
them in 1922 !

======================
 I have given this longish history of the delay in publication to bring out a
few points : (1). All important Manuscripts must be kept most carefully. The
risk of loss by moths or in transit etc., must be avoided. (2). If possible,
more than one copy of the Manuscript should be typed, to guard against any
irreplaceable loss of it. (3). The Manuscript as soon as it is ready may be
given even to some Jaina periodical to be published. It is easier to reprint it
in book form later, when many mistakes can be avoided and corrections made. (4).
True lovers of Jainism, learned men and rich men, should co-operate and organise
the public service of the community in such a manner that the invaluable work of
the preservation and propagation of Jaina Sacred Books in all important
languages may be accelerated. As to the great authority and veneration of Shri
Gommatasara, it is enough to say that if Tattvartha Sutra is the Jaina Bible,
the Gommatasara is a brief expansion of a part of that Bible, giving the Path to
Perfection or Liberation. The Path is clear and conclusive. If followed, it
leads to the Goal, Liberation, The Goal cannot be attained without following it.
The Soul-Classes, Quests and Stages, given in this book, may be verified by
anyone easily with the necessary time, trouble, inclination and sympathetic
realisation of the Word of the Omniscient, any day, in any condition of life, in
any part of the World. To follow the Path, it is not necessary to be born a
Jaina or to profess or embrace Jainism. Call yourself by whatever name you like,
live your life as you have lived it hitherto, but if it is in accord with
Jainism, if it conforms to the type and measure of faith, knowledge and conduct
leading to the Goal, the soul may be sure that he or she is a Liberable being
and on the Path to Truth, and Freedom from the miseries and limitations of
embodied existence. -You build yourself. The Soul is the sole architect of its
life and condition, here and hereafter. As such, believers in Jainism and those
who come to consider and weigh Jainism in their search after Truth will find
this translation a valuable guide.

 The mistakes in the matter and manner of the book are proofs of my incapacity
to grasp and reflect even one distant broken ray of the great Sun of
Omniscience, from which direct descent is rightly claimed by the book and its
contents. In all humility, I beg to be pardoned for this; and the indulgent
learned, I am sure, will forgive an ignorant and humble admirer of theirs for
his inevitable shortcomings. Indeed all my Jaina writings are really a
poorlyequipped student's First Notes. I am not a Samskrit or Prakrit Scholar.
Then my excursions into Jainism have been few and occasional. But they have been
always most honest, concentrated and with a soul eager and fully devoted to know
the Truth of Jainism. My aim has been not to justify or defend or even to
explain Jainism; but simply to record its whole tradition in its entire purity.
In conclusion, I must thank Jaina Dharma Bhushana Brahma : chari Sital Prasada
and Pandit Ajit Prasada, M. A., LL.B. for their unrepayable obligation upon me,
in seeing the book through the Press at the cost of so much time and trouble.

======================
 INTRODUCTION, The Name and Origin of the Book Gommatasara. The probable reasons
for the name Gommatasara having been assigned to this authoritative work on Jain
Philosophy may be summed up as below. In the Karma Kanda Gatha 965, the author
says that this treatise is based on the discourses of Shri Vardhamana, the 24th
and the last Jain Tirthankara of the present era in Bharata Kshetra, and the
teachings are also well established by the rules of logic, Pramana and Naya. The
author has called Shri Vardhamana or Mahavira by the name of Gommatadeva. The
word Gommata is probably derived from " go" speech, and "mata" or "matha" abode,
meaning "the Abode of Speech," the Lord from whom flows the letterless voice,
the wonderful music. Divya-Dhvani. Sara means the essence, the condensed
purport. The word Gommatasara would thus mean the " Essence of the Discourses of
Lord Mahavira". Again, we learn from the Samskrit commentary, that the treatise
is a compilation of the answers given by the author Shri Nemi Chandra Siddhanta
Chakravarti, to the questions put to him by Raja Chamunda Raya, asking him to
enumerate the sub-classes of bodymaking Karma, and to explain their existence,
bondage, non-bondage, and cessation of bondage, with regard to the spiritual
stages of

======================
 souls in various conditions of life from the fine completely undevelopable
vegetable bodied soul, to the fully developed rational fivesensed beings. The
answers are based on the ancient manuscripts, Dhayala, Jaya Dhavala and Maha
Dhavala, still preserved in needle pricked characters on palm-leaves in the Jain
temple at Mudbidri, South Canara, India. The major part of Gommatasara is based
on Dhavala, which was composed by Acharya Bhutabali about 7th century after Lord
Mahavira. Chamund Raya was also called Raja Gommata most probably on account of
his great devotion to Shri Gommata Deva or Lord Mahavira. As a complement to the
Great questioner, the compilation has been called Gommatasara after his name.
Chamunda Raya. Chamunda Raya was a brave general and a great minister of the
Jain King Raja. Rajamalla who reigned from 974 to 984 A. C. (after Christ), and
belonged to the Ganga dynasty.* The ancestors of this Jaina dynasty ruled at
Ayodhya, and were descended from the ancient Ikshwaku family, founded by
Rishabhadeva, the first Tirthankara. Once it so happened, that Vijaya Maha Devi,
wife of Raja Bharata, a descendant of the family, while pregnant, went to take a
bath in the Ganges. A son was born to her there, and was on account of this
circumstance, named Ganga Datta. He became a renowned King and the Dynasty was
called Ganga-Vansha after his name. In this dynasty Maharaja Vishnu Gopa
flourished at Ahichchatrapore (near Bareily, U. P.) He had two sons from his
wife Prithvi-mati, named Bhagadatta and Shri Datta. Bhaga Datta went to the
Kalinga country(near Orrissa),ruled there and established the Kalinga Ganga
dynasty. Shri Datta continued to rule at Ahichchatra. Raja Padma Nabha was a
descendent of his. He had two sons named Rama and Lakshman. In consequence of
some dispute with Raja Mahipal of Ujjain (Malva), he had to leave Ahichchatra
for Deccan with his sons, whose names he changed to Didiga and Madhava. They
wert to Perur in District Codappa in the Madras Presidency and offered respects
to the learned and spiritually advanced Acharya Sinha Nandi, who bestowed
spiritual blessings on them. They established their power near Mysore in the
second century after Christ. The 21st King in descent from Madhava who commenced
to rule in 103 A.C. was Raja Malla II. Chamunda Raya belonged to the clan of
Brahma Khsatriya. He won many battles and received many titles, like Samara-
Dhurandhara * Mysore by Rice Vol. I.

 "the leader in battle," Vira Martanda, "the sun among the brave," Rana Raja
Sinha, "a great Lion in battle," Vairi Kula Kala Danda "The sceptre of death for
the hosts of enemies," Bhuja Martanda "The sun among the powerful-armed." Samara
Parshurama, "Parashurama in battle," Satya Yudhisthira, "Yudhisthira in speaking
truth." He was great scholar also. He wrote a commentary* on Gommatasara, in the
Canarese language in presence of the author Shri Nemi Chandra Siddhanta
Chakravarti. He also composed Chamunda Rava Purana in Canarese and Charitra
sara, a treatise on the practices of ascetics in Samskrit. Appreciative mention
of Raja Chamunda Raya has been made by the author in Karma Kanda Gatha 966 to
972. Raja Chamunda Raya took vows of a layman from the Great Saint Ajitasena,
who was a disciple of the order of Acharya Aryasena, as stated in Gatha 734 of
Jiva Kanda. Raja Chamunda Raya constructed a beautiful Jaina. Temple now called
Chamunda Raya Basti at Chandragiri in front of Vindhvagiri at Shravana Belgula,
district Hasan, Mysore, containing a beautiful image of Shri Nemi Nath to whom
our author has offered obeisance on several occasions in Gommatasara. He
constructed in 983 A. C. the great and wonderful image of Shri Bahubali, called
Gommata Swami, Gommateshvara, "the Lord of Gommata" after his name. Bahubali was
one of the sons of the first Tirthankara Rishabha Deva and ruled at Podnapore.
He had a contest with his eldest brother Bharata and defeated him. But he felt
so distressed on this account that he renounced all temporal power and adopted
an ascetic life. He practised the severest austerities. He stood unmoved for a
whole year, in the standing posture, in meditation, so deep and concentrated
that creepers spread and entwined themselves round his legs and arms. He was the
first who obtained omniscience in this Avasarpini cycle in Bharata Kshetra even
before Lord Rishabha. His unsurpassed severe austerities have been very often
extolled in Jaina Shastras. The wonderrul image at Vindhyagiri represents this
exemplary attitude of meditation.. The grandeur of the Image, as also its
serene-looking and peace-inspiring presence, are well-known to all Jainas and
nonJainas who have had the good fortune of visiting it. When I visited the
sacred place in 1910, I met some English men and women missionaries, who out of
respect for the Holy Image took off their shoes and visited it in their bare
feet. They also held the opinion *Keshava Varni has based his Commentary on
Gommatasara on this work.

 8 which I have given above. The Image is about 57 feet high and still every
limb and minor limb thereof is in exquisite proportion. It is impossible to
convey its glory and artistic excellence by words. Any one who has the chance of
seeing it personally will easily agree with the hitherto general opinion. * This
gives an answer to some critics also who call the Jainas Idolatrous. The Jainas
do not worship the stone, silver, gold or diamond of which the Images are made.
They worship the qualities of Total Renunciation of the World, the Acquisition
of undisturbable Harmony with the Infinite, and the Identity of the Liberated
Soul with Peace everlasting, which these Images represent. Shakespeare with
traduction : Also to quote "Ah me! how sweet is Jina itself possessed, When but
Jina's shadows are so rich in joy!" (Romeo and Juliet), Where I substitute "Jina
" for "Love". It is clear how irresistible and experientially axiomatic must
have been the Peace and Guidance given by the Arhats and Omniscients, when their
mere Images are so potent of Grace, peace and inspiration. So much for the
origin of the name Gommatasara. A noticeable feature about Gommatasara is that
the Author has always followed the earliest known beacon-lights of Jainism,
after Lord Mahavira's Moksha. The most known of these lights is Bhadrabahu(the
5th shruta-Kevali, 162 A.V., after Vardhamana). He was the preceptor of the
Mauryan Emperor Chandragupta, who became a saint and was called Prabha Chandra
and who renounced the body at Kata vapra Hill, Chandragiri, Shravanabelgula,
just in front of the feet of the great Bahubali. Shri Nemi Chandra also follows
the tradition of Shri KundaKundacharya, who flourished in the first century B.
C., V. S. 49 (vide Introduction to Panchastikaya S. B. J. Vol. III). As an
authority on the learned Jain scriptures, he is next to Shri Gautama Ganadhara,
the chief of all saints, who directly received the Discourses of Lord Mahavira,
delivered from his unquivering lips in letterless voice and who expounded the
principles of the Jaina religion. Shri Kunda-Kundacharya has composed among
others, the wonderful works on Jaina Metaphysics called Samayasara, Niyamasara,
Panchastikaya Samayasara and Pravachana Sara. He also followed the tradition of
Uma Swami, who occupied the pontifical seat, after Shri Kunda Kunda-charya, and
gave to the world the Jain Bible, Tatvartha Sutra.

 9 The Author. The age and the date, etc., of the author Shri Nemichandra
Siddhanta Chakravarti need not be repeated here, as they are dealt with at
length by the learned Professor S. C. Ghosal, M. A., LL. B., in the first volume
of the Sacred Books of the Jainas, entitled Dravya Samgraha. He flourished about
1000 A. D. Siddhanta Chakravarti. The saintly author is called the Siddhanta
Chakravarti, or the Emperor of Jaina Scriptures. According to Jaina Geography, a
Karma Bhumi (or region where human beings depend for their livelihood upon work,
such as agriculture, etc.,) has six parts: One Arya Khanda or the part peopled
by noble, religious and meritorious good people, and 5 Mlechchha Khandas,
peopled by the rest of the inhabitants of the Karma Bhumi. The extreme Northern
and Southern Countries, Airavata and Bharata respectively and 32 countries of
Videha in the middle of Jambu Dvipa are such Karma Bhumis. A Chakravarti is the
king of the Capital of Arya Khanda of Bharata or Airavata. He advances, and
conquers all his neighbours, and by his prowess and piety brings all the 5
Mlechchha Khandas also under him and becomes the sole Emperor of all the six
parts of Bharata Kshetra. Similarly the Jaina scriptures are only an infinite
expressed part of the inexpressible all-grasping omniscience, which comprehends
all the attributes and all modifications of all substances in all ages, past,
present and future, from beginningless time to endless Eternity. A very small
account of these Scriptures is given in Jiva Kanda Gathas 348, etc., seqq. Sri
Nemichandra was the Siddhanta Chakravarti, because he had conquered all the
realms of the known knowledge of the Sacred Books. He was called the Emperor
because he had like a Chakravarti conquering the six parts of Bharata mastered
the famous authoritative works Dhavala, etc., composed by Bhutabali and
Pushpadanta, the disciples of Arahatbali some 7 century after Lord Mahavira
which consists of 6 parts called "Jiva Sthana," "Kshudraka Bandha," "Bandha
Swami," "Vedana khanda," "Vargana-Khanda and "Mahabandha." Gatha 397 of Karma
Kanda may be quoted here. jaha cakkeNa ya cakkI chakkhaMDa sAhiyaM zraviggheNa
/  AC ALAEU AU g+ds' atfga aza || 380 ||| Just as a Chakravarti monarch conquers
six parts of the country by his Chakra weapon, so I have mastered the six parts
of Dhavala, etc., by my weapon of intellect.

 10 His title is justified by his well-known books, Dravya Samgraha translated
as volume I of the Sacred Books of the Jainas, "Gommatasara, Jiva Kanda and
Karma Kanda, Labdhisara, Kshapanasara and the wonderful Trilokasara, a book on
Jaina Cosmology, without a study of which it is impossible to understand Jainism
in its minute details and classifications or its artistic and perfect
solidarity. His works deal mainly with Karnanuyoga, one of the four Vedas or
Anuyogas of the Jaina Siddhanta, called Prathamanuyoga, Karnanuyoga,
Charananuyoga, and Dravyanuyoga. The Four Anuyogas. 1. Prathamanuyoga, History,
the Part dealing with the ages and lives of the Great Personages of the World,
specially with those of the 63 Great Persons (Shalaka-Purushas), i. e., the 24
Tirthankaras, the 12 Chakravartis, the 9 Narayanas, 9 Prati-Narayanas and the 9
Balabhadras.. 2. Karnanuyoga, Cosmology, the Part dealing with Space, the
Universe, the Non-Universe, the Three worlds, their description, dimensions and
denizens and different calculations as regards spiritual stages and soul-quests.
3. Charananuyoga, Ritual, the part dealing with rules of conduct for laymen and
for ascetics. Of these the former are detailed in the eleven Pratimas or stages
of restraint and renunciation of householders; the latter are the stricter and
harder rules of greater and fuller restraint and renunciation for ascetics. 4.
Dravyanuyoga, Philosophy, the part dealing with the substances. Primarily the
substances are two: Soul and Non-soul. But they are enumerated six, as because
the non-soul obviously consists of five independent and distinctly individual
substances, Matter, Time, Space and the Media of Motion and Rest. Thus, there
are six substances: Soul (Jiva), Matter (Pudgala), Time (Kala), Space (Akasha),
Motion (Dharma), and Rest (Adharma). Matter is of many kinds. But the most
mighty kind is Karmic matter, which the mundane soul wears and which is the
self-wound motor to keep the soul moving in "Samsara." This connection of Soul
and the Non-Soul matter necessitates a consideration of the inflow of Karma into
soul, the bondage of soul by Karma, the stoppage of the inflow, the shedding of
the bondage, and perfect freedom of the soul from Karma. These 7 are called the
Tattvas or principles of Jainism. They are soul (Jiva), Non-Soul

 11 (Ajiva), Asrava (Inflow), Bandha (Bondage), samvara (stoppage), Nirjara
(Shedding), and Moksha (Liberation). Omniscience, There is another way of
glancing at the subject. As the six Khandas of one Karma Bhumi, huge as they are
(the m of our Bharata Kshetra is about 21 lacs of miles with a length of about 5
crores and 81 lacs of miles), are nothing compared with Space or the universe,
even so the works and knowledge of Sri Nemichandra, tremendous though they are,
are really nothing in comparison with the whole knowledge, possessed by the
Kevali Jina, the Omniscient Conqueror of Karmas. Yet Shri Gommatasara Jiya Kanda
is a good introduction to the Great Tattva, Soul (Jiva). "Know Thyself", has
been the precept and practice of all serious searchers after the truth about
Soul. Jainism is an uncompromising apotheosis of knowledge. And in a way in
Jainism even Omniscience also is experiential, almost empi. rical. The Soul in
Omniscient over flow (Kevala Samudghata) touches the universe. This Omniscience
again is a negation of Noetics. There is no Science or progression in
Omniscience. It is just the seeing of the Whole Truth. It is a full and direct
manifestation of the Soul. Knowledge is the essence of soul. There is no soul
without knowledge. There is no knowledge or knowability without soul.
Nonomniscience is merely a result of the soul being obscured by the conation-
obscuring, and knowledge-obscuring (Darshanavarniya and Jnanavarniya) Karmas.
These being destroyed, Omniscience, the real Natural characteristic of the Soul
manifests itself. There are infinite souls. Each one has infinite attributes and
modifications in Space and Time. It is not easy to classify and analyse and
describe them. Less than an Omniscient cannot do it. Less than an Omniscient can
follow it only by faith and fragmentarily. Our puny measures of Logic, Science
and popular Philosophy are as capable of measuring Omniscience, as our yards and
inches are of measuring Space. There are two ways known to us of having a very
rough and remote Idea of Omniscience. One is by considering the exte early Jaina
Sacred Literature which is mostly lost to-day; and the other and even a better
one is by considering the Jaina theory of numbers. Both subjects are of high
value, and immense use, and it is best to consider them here.

 12 Early Jaina Sacred Literature. The knowledge of Shruti, Shruta-Jnana, may be
of things which are contained in the Angas (Limbs or sacred books of the Jainas)
or of things outside the Angas. There are 64 simple letters of the alphabet. Of
these 33 are consonants, 27 vowels, and 4 auxiliary (which help in the formation
of compound letters). The total number of possible combinations of these 64
simple letters into compounds of 2, 3, 4, or more up to 64 letters is:
24-1-1,84,46,74,40,73,70,95,51,615. These are the letters (simple and compound)
of Shruta in its entirety. This number being divided by 16,348,307,888, which is
the number of letters in a central foot (madhyama-pada) of the Paramagama,
(Sacred Jaina Literature), gives us the number of padas of the Angas as 11, 283,
58, 005. The remainder 80,108,175, gives us the letters of that part of Shruta
which is not contained in the Angas. This part is divided into 14 Prakirnakas.
1.-The Twelve Angas, The Angas are twelve, as follows: 1. The Achara-anga
comprises a full exposition of the rules of conduct for ascetics. It contains
18,000 Madhyama Padas. 2. The Sutrakrita-anga comprises a detailed exposition of
knowledge, humility, etc., of religious rites and difference between the rites
of one's own religion and those of the other one-sided views. It contains 36,000
Madhyama Padas. 3. The Sthana-anga comprises an exposition of one or more
sthanas, or numerical points of view in considering Jiva (Soul),Pudgala (Matter)
and other Dravyas. While the Jiva-dravya, or soul. is from the point of view of
consciousness one and the same everywhere; from the point of view of being
liberated (siddha) or mundane (samsarin) it is of two kinds. Similarly, the
samsarin, or mundane Jiva, that is, the soul not yet perfectly freed from the
bondage of karmas, which keep it moving in the cycle of existences is of three
kinds, one sensed, immobile (sthavara), not full-sensed (vikalendriya), and in
possession of all the organs of the senses, full-sensed (sakalendriya). The
liberated souls too, are of many kinds from the point of view of place, time,
etc. This anga contains 42,000 M. padas. 4. The Samavaya-anga gives an account
of the similarities that arise from the point of view of Dravya (elements of the
universe), Kshetra (place), Kala (time), Bhava (character). From the

deeds; from the real standpoint it has pure modifications in its own nature.
From practical point of view it is said to speak falsely or truly ; from the
real standpoint it has no speech. It is called pranin, because the pranas are
found in it both internally and externally, from both points of view. From the
real point of view it enjoys its own true bliss, but from a practical standpoint
it enjoys the fruits of its Karmas good or bad. From a practical point, it
absorbs the material Karmas and is material ; in reality it is immaterial. From
both points of view it exists at all times and knows all the things of the past,
present and future. From a practical view-point it pervades the body, but in
reality it has innumerable spatial units of universe,

 23 The third column of the brief statement of 21 kinds of numbers shows that
really there are two unknown :-D. and M. Let us see what they are. D, or
Jaghanya Parita Asamahyata. To find D. i. e., Jaghanya Parita Asamkhyata. Let
there be four pits each of 1 lac Yojanas in diameter, and 1000 Yojanas deep and
called : Anavastha .... (d') Shalaka ... (BI) Pratishalaka .. (Y ) Mahashalaka
... (X) Fill d' with round rape-seeds; overfill it from its mouth surface in a
regular conical form, the apex of which is one rape seed; as The number of seeds
in the pit is 197912092999) 680000000000000000 000000000000000 |(31 zeroes). The
number in the cone above 179920084545163 63636363636363631 246 figs.
636363636363636-4 (16 thirty sixes). The total seeds are 1997112938 45
1316363636363636363) 46 636363636363636 4 figs. Say Z For this filling of di,
drop one seed in B1 Then take up the seeds from b , and drop one seed on each of
the continents and Oceans beginning with Jambudvipa. Where the last seed is
dropped, it would be an Ocean, (disregard the 411 seed, which will not be in the
Cone). Now dig a pit of the diameter of this Ocean, of the same depth, in e.,
1000 Yojanas, Call it d2: and fill it in with rape seeds like a topping Cone, as
di was filled in. Then drop another rape seed in B for the filling of do. Then
take up the seeds from de and drop one each on the Continents and Oceans
beginning with the Continent next to the Ocean where the last seed from di was
dropped, whereever in a continent or Ocean the last seed of d? is dropped, take
the diameter of that as the diameter of the next pit di which is also 1000
Yoianas deep. Fill it up conically liked and d' . For the filling of ds. drop a
third rape seed into B'. Repeat till Bi is filled in the usual top Conical form.
The number of seeds in B1 is =Z; and much larger in each of the pits di to da
successively, because their diameters are much larger at each step.

 24 For the filling of B: drop a seed in V. Repeat the same process of dropping
one seed on each Continent and Ocean, beginning from the one next to where the
last seed from the last Z pit was dropped. The next pit L2 +1 will be 1000
Yojanas deep and with a diameter of the Continent or Ocean where the last seed
from the L z pit was dropped. Go on till there are Z pits of the L class with
ever-increasing diameter. When the last pit i. e., Lz is exhausted, drop one
seed in Y. Now Y' is also conically filled. Then drop the first seed in X.
Repeat till X is also filled. Then the number of L pits will be Z. The number of
seeds in the last of these Z3 pits is the number D or Jaghanya Parita
Asamkhyata. In other words, Dno of rape-seeds in the (Z ) th pit, where Z is 46
figures, ante and where each Continent and Ocean in the width of its ring is
double of its immediate predecessor, and never more than only one seed is
dropped on each. In other words still. To find D. i. e., Jaghanya Parita -
Asamkhy Take a pit of the diameter of Jambudvipa i.e., of 1 lac Yojanas and of
1000 Yojanas depth. Fill it with round rape seeds; over fill it from its mouth
surface in a regular conical form, the apex of which is one rape seed; as 1 ...
45 fig. The number of seeds in the pit is ,, ,, ,, in the cone above is ... 46
fig. The total seeds are ... 46 fig. Say Z. Now there are innumerable Continents
& Oceans in the Middle World (Madhya Loka). Each Continent is surrounded by a
ring of an Ocean, which in its turn is ringed round by a Continent. Also the
width of the ring of each Continent & Ocean is double the width of the ring of
its iminediately preceding Ocean and Continent. Now we take the Z seed out of
our first pit, and drop one seed, on each of the Continents and Oceans beginning
with Jambu Dvipa. Where the last seed is dropped, it would be an Ocean. Now dig
a pit of the diameter of this Ocean. Fill it with rape-seeds in the form of a
topping Cone as before. Take the seeds out of it and proceed to drop one each
beginning from the Continent next to the Ocean which gave us the Diameter of
this 2nd pit. Then wherever you drop the last seed of this 2nd

 25 pit, take the diameter of that Continent or Ocean for a fresh pit, which is
to be filled conically as before and the seeds from which are also to be
disposed of as before. Go on doing this for Z times; The number of seeds in the
last i. e. (Z ) th pit is-D. The imaginary dropping of rape-seeds on the
Continents and Oceans serves the purpose of showing. (1) the tremendous extent
of the area of the Middle World ; (2) the real character of the Jaina
Mathematical ideal of an innumerable number, which although innumerable is still
not infinite; and (3) the tremendous, soul-staggering extent of Omniscience. To
find G-Jaghanya Yukta Asamkhyata. Take D and virlana it, or spread it into its
units; i.e., write down as many ones as there are units in D. On the top of each
one, place a D (called Deya). Multiply all together. The product is DD. This is
equal to G. This is the number of instants (samayas) in an avali or wink. In
other words G=DO, M. or Jaghanya Parita-Ananta. Now we come to the other great
unknown M. To find MJaghanya Parita Ananta. Take Jaghanya Asamkhyata,
Asamkhyata,J.,which is-G' _D2 D Treat it to the third degree of Shalaka-Virlana-
Deya, as below. In Shala ka Virlana-Deya, there are always three dispositions of
the number treated. The first is called Shala ka. The number is kept in this and
is reduced by one at each completion of process in the next two dispositions.
The second disposition is called Virlana. In this one is placed in as many
places as there are units in the number. The third disposition is Deya. It is
the number which is given to be placed on the top of every unit in the Virlana.
The first Deya is always the number itself. Let us treat 3 by this method. We
place 3 as Shalaka. We place 3 ones under Virlana ; and the Deya is 3. In the
Virlana on the top of each 1 we place 3. We multiply all these threes and get
3x3x3 - 27. This is the next Deya, Now we reduce the Shalaka by one. So at the
second step we have 2 as

======================
 26 Shalaka ; 27 ones as Virlana; and 27 as Deya. The next Deya would be 2727.
Now we reduce the Shalaka by another one. So at the third step we have 1 as as
Shalaka ; 2727 ones as Virlana, and 2727 as Deya. The next Deya or the result of
27 37 Virlana is Now we can reduce the Shalaka by one more 27 7 27 The process
is complete. The result Let us express it symbolically thus: 2710, which means
that 27 is to be written four times, once as a base, then as a power of that
base, then as a power of that power and so on. If we take the last result, i.e.
2710, and treat it by the Shala ka method as we treated the three above, it
would be a two-fold treatment, Thus : take 27 and treat it as Shala ka, virlana,
Deya. Virlana 274 and place on the top of each unit of the Virlana process the
number272),multiply all these27) together and now reduce one out of the Shalaka
number 2711). The product of this multiplication should be considered as the
next Virlana and Deva Virlana this virlana into separate units and place on the
top of each unit, the Deya thus obtained. Multiply together all these Deya Then
reduce one more from our Shalaka 27177. Consider the product of this second
multiplication to be the next virlana and Deya ; Virlana it as before and place
on the top of each virlana unit this product and multiply all these Deya
together and then again subtract one from our Shalaka 7171; proceed serially in
the same way considering the ever and ever increasing new and new product of
each multiplication as virlana and Deya; and go on virlaning and multiplying
together the new ever-increasing product of the multiplication at each step
reducing one at a time from 27,1!, until the whole Shalaka 2714 is totally
exhausted ; thus we reach the end of the two-fold treatment. The result of this
second treatment also being treated in the Shalaka way will give us the third
degree Shalaka treatment of 3 i. e.. the huge product of the multiplication at
the end of the second Shalaka treatment should be treated and considered as the
new and fresh Shalaka virlana and Deya ; and it should be exhausted exactly as
above by successive virlana and Deya, placing Deya on each unit and then
multiplying all Deya together and then reducing one from this Shalaka on each
multiplication of all the Deya. This is

 27 technically called Shalaka-Traya-Nisthapana. The result of treating J like
this is a kind of K. To this result add the following six :1. The innumerable
spatial units of the substance of motion (Dharma Dravya). 2. The innumerable
spatial units of the substance of Rest (Adharma Dravya). 3. The innumerable
spatial units of one soul (ek Jiva Dravya). 4. The innumerable spatial units of
the Universe-Space (Lokakacha). 5. Innumerable x innumerable spatial units of
the Universe, i.e. the number of non-host individual souls (Apratisthita
Pratyeka). 6. Innumerable x innumerable spatial units, i.e. the number of host
individual souls (Sapratisthita Pratyeka). Take the total of these 7 and treat
it to Shalaka-Traya-nisthapana as above. The result is again a kind of K. To
this add the following four : 1. Instants of one Kalpa or a cycle of Avasarpini
and Utsarpini (the instants of 20 crore x crore sagaras of years). 2.
Innumerable x innumerable spatial units of the Universe, i.e. the number of
thought-activities of the soul which determine the duration of bondage of Karmas
(Sthiti-bandha Adhyavasaya Sthana). 3. Innumerable x innumerable spatial units
of the Universe, i.e. the number of degrees of passion which determine the
intensity, or the mild or strong fruition, of bondage of Karmas (Anubhagabandha-
Adhyavasaya Sthana). 4. Innumerable innumerable spatial units of the Universe,
i.e. the number of the units of soul's vibratory activities (Avibhaga
pratichchheda of Yoga). Take the total of these five and treat it to Shalaka
TrayaNisthapana as above. The result is equal to M. To find U-Utkrista Ananta-
Ananta. Take S. Treat it to Shalaka-Traya-Nisthapana. The result is a kind of T.
To this add the following six : 1. Infinite part of all souls, i.e., the number
of liberated souls (Siddhas). 2. Infinite above, i. e. the number of common or
groupsouled vegetable (sadharana vanaspati nigoda) souls (i.e. all the mundane
souls, except the earth, water, fire, air, and individual or one-souled
vegetable, and mobile souls).

 28 3. Infinite x above, i.e. the number of all vegetable souls (Vanaspati). 4.
Infinite x all souls, i. e. the number of atoms of matter (Pudgala). 5. Infinite
x infinite matter-atoms, i.e., number of instants in Practical Time (Vyavahara
Kala). 6. Infinite xinfinite instants in Practical Time, i. e.; the number of
spatial units in the non-universe space (Aloka kasha). Take the total of these
seven and treat it to shala ka-TrayaNishthapana. The result is a kind of T. To
this add the infinitex the infinite which is the number of units (Avibhaga
Pratichchheda) of the individuality attribute (Aguru-laghu-guna) in the
substances of Motion and Rest (Dharma and Adharma Dravya). Take the total of
these two, and treat it to Shalaka-Traya-Nishthapana. The result is a kind of T.
Subtract this from the number of units (Avibhaga Pratichchheda) of perfect
knowledge (Kevala Jnana); and then add it to the remainder. Thus the number of
units of perfect knowledge is U. This last subtraction and addition of the same
is to show that even this last kind of T, soul-straining though it is, is
nothing compared with U, Omniscience, which is the goal and glory of Jainism,
being the highest and the most Ideal condition of the Purest possible soul. Note
that the expression "innumerable x innumerable," and "infinitex infinite" is
employed above, because the innumerables and the infinites are not the same. By
this time it will be clear that there are a huge number of these innumerables
and infinites in the Middle kinds, included in E. H. K. and in N. Q. and T. (See
Triloka Sara Gathas 9 to 52).

 29 The contents of Gommatasara. This book is really a very brief and hasty
glance at the Great Theme, a feeble human effort to give a rough idea of the
soul-astounding extent of Divine Ominscience. It confines itself to a short
account of Spritual Stages and Soul-quests which are the wellknown Jaina ways of
the considering the soul. Jiva Kanda is only the first part of the great work
Gommatasara; the second part being the Karma Kanda. The two Parts together are a
brief expansion and explanation of the beautiful little Dravya Samgraha, by the
same author. Jivamajivam Davvam (tara ze), the living and the non-living
substances are the opening words of (Dravya Samgraha). Gommatasara simply deals
with these two mighty categories with the living soul in the Jiva Kanda, and
with the non-living Karmic matter in the Karma Kanda. Dravya Samgraha is the
merest enumeration of the topics of Jainism with their main divisions and sub-
divisions. It consists 58 Gathas and 5 Parts. Part I. Substances. The Mundane
Soul. Gathas 1 to 14. ,, II. The Non-soul ; Matter; Motion ; Rest; Space; and

 31 Impulse (Sanjna): and (14) Soul-quests (Margana); also (12 kinds of)
Conscious Attentiveness (Upayoga); respectively have been described (in) 20
chapters. NOTE:In the 20 chapters, the 14 soul-quests alone form 14 chapters,
the others take one chapter each. Gatha 4 tells us how Soul-classes,
Developableness, Vitalities, Rationality and Attention are included in the 14
Quests, and therefore the chief considerations in treating of the soul are, 14
Spiritual stages, the degree to which the mundane soul has advanced in its
freedom from wrong-belief, vowless ness, negligence, passions and vibratory
activity; and 14 Soul-quests, the conditions, circumstances, and equip ments
which help us to identify the soul when we are seeking to mark it in the
infinity of mundane exis tences. These 2 are also interconnected. The stages
classify the soul briefly; the quests take them up in greater detail (See Gatha
3). The stages are named in Gathas, 9-10; mincho sAsaNa misso aviradasammo ya

other, perfect vow (Apramatta-Virata), New thought activity (Apurva Karana),

Vibratory omniscient conqueror (Sayoga Kevali Jina), and non-vibratory
omniscient (Ayoga-Kevali), these 14 should be known to be the spiritual stages
(Gunasthana), one after another. After the last, the soul becomes liberated
(Siddha). The Quests are given in Gatha 142:gaiiMdiyesu kAye joge vede

 32 The English translation is : The fourteen-soul-quests are:-1 Conditions of
existence(Gati), 2 Sense (Indriya). 3 Embodiment (Kaya), 4 Vibratory activity
(Yoga), 5 Sex-inclination (Veda), 6 Passion (Kashaya), 7 Knowledge (Jnana) 8
Control (Samyama), 9 Conation (Darshana). 10 Thought-paint (Leshya), 11 Capacity
of Liberation (Bhavya), 12 Right-belief (Samyaktva). 13 Rationality (Samjnitva),
and 14 Assimilation of matter (Ahara). The stages and quests, with their many
divisions and sub-divisions, and inter-connections (these are specially treated
in the two Appendices, Gathas 677-734), really exhaust the point of view from
which souls in the world may be viewed. Our matter-mad, mammonmad world may
blind us to Truth. But the sign-posts on the path to it, though deserted and
neglected still shine with their eternal splendour and are unerring guides to
the soul who understands itself and cares to tread the hard and lonely but sure
path to freedom unending and bliss everlasting. Shri Nemichandra has not erected
these sign-posts. He is eager and careful to tell us at each step "The Conqueror
has said so" "the All-knowing has described it;" etc. The passions and the
cease-less vibrations are the primary and essential cause of stages and these
and the operation of other Karmas that of quests. The soul who wants to know
itself will soon see its thraldom to the Passion of Anger, Pride, Deciet and
Greed, and Sleep and Attachment and their innumerable combinations. Here as
everywhere else in Jainism, there is no room for unreasoned faith. If anyone
claims this and frightens away the earnest inquirers, it is not the fault of
Jainism. It is a gross misunderstanding, and misrepresentation of Jainism. It is
fouling one's own nest. True Jainism does not want blind faith. It wants
knowledge of Universal principle. Nay, More. It wants realisation and
application of this knowledge to the tears and smiles of our neighbours, to the
dew and sun on the red rose, to the rainbow on the sky, to the roaring torrents
of the Niagara, to the fury of the floods and famines in our Motherland, India,
and to the solution of the soul-racking problems of Economics and Politics in
Europe and America. No corner of the Universe, no condition of life, no
modification in our finest tremor of the mind or soul, no change of form in
lifeless matter anywhere nothing is hidden from Jainism. Nothing is exempt from
the Sovereign Law of Causation, from the unconquerable Rigour of Karma. The
Stages and Quests of the soul here below are entirely due to this. The
omniscients of old, the saints, with souls which were purer than the purest
ideals concievable by men, and stronger

 33 than adamant in their body and more lustrous in the Light of their souls
than the sun or many suns,-these saints saw these Eternal Principles of Life and
embodied them in their teachings. These teachings are for all souls high or low,
in all ages and in all climes. There is no barrier of casts, creed or colour to
their investigation and adoption. The greater part of Jaina literature is still
unpublished. Therefore its lustre is not shed all over the world. Therefore the
whole of humanity is in the iron-grip of war, of trade-jealousy and trade-
deciet, of pain and selfishness, of dejection, disappointment and fear. Popular
Aspect of the Philosophy in the Book. Evidently in Religion and Philosophy there
is no greater concept than Soul ; and in the whole world there is no greater
phenomenon than life. This book throws a flood of light on the question of
Living beings as we know them and how they may reach their ideal - Nirvana.
Living man as we see him is obviously a combination of two distinct substances ;
Living and Non-living. Let us consider these. At the outset one marvellous thing
is noticeable. We do see purely non-living things, as the pen with which I am
writing or the paper which you are reading. But pure life is never met with in
the world. So the position really is that we have : (1) Living substance mixed
with non-living substance; and (2) Non-living substance. There is non-living
matter in both. But in one there is life also; in the other, not. Vitalities.
Another important and useful fact is the fact of death, It is not annihilation
of anything, soul or matter. It is only a separation of the outer body from the
soul, which is still combined with two material but fine bodies. It is only when
soul obtains ratoin, that it becomes permanently pure and completely rid of all
combination with matter. By careful comparison we can find a trace to the
characteristic features of life and its differences from lifelessness. The first
thing we notice in one, who was living but is dead now, is that his senses do
not act. He cannot touch, taste, smell, see or hear. He has no vitality of the
senses. Also he is powerless. He cannot act, speak or think. He has no force, no
vitality of body, speech or mind. But many of these things may be absent

 34 also in a living man who is asleep, in a trance or otherwise unconscious.
Therefore all over the world we examine the man's respiration. If it is there,
we say, "he still lives." If not, we say "he has breathed his last." So Spencer
speaks of Death as "nought but parting of the breath." Faerie Queene, book 7,
canto 7, stanza 46. This respiration is a sure sign of life. It is also popular
speech to say of a dead man," he has numbered his days"; "his time has come"
etc. Without going into the insoluble mysteries of metaphysics, in the above
common observations, which may be made anywhere and at any time and by anyone,
we have the surest and most self-evident distinction between living and lifeless
objects. If we can believe in the testimony of our own immediate observation,
confirmed by the fact that the experience of every other thinking being is
exactly the same, we must sum up the distinction between living and non-living
substances thus. A non-living substance does not have, (1) The Vitality of the 5
senses ; (2) The Power of body, speech and mind ; (3) Respiration; and (4) Age.
These four may be called the four (or with their sub-divisions ten) vitalities
of living beings. But it is noticeable that all these four or ten are also a
manifestation of one underlying real fact; viz. that of consciousness. In a dead
body the sense-organs are there and the eye may be impressed with colour and
form as before, but there is no consciousness behind it which in life received,
and recorded, and responded to the Ocular stimulus. The four or ten Vitalities
are sure signs to dtstinguish the living from the non-living ; but in reality it
is consciousness which distinguishes life from lifelessness. Too much and too
careful thought cannot be given to this Consciousness. If we do not understand
it, we shall wander from the truth. Let us, therefore, try to gain further
insight into this consciousness. Consciousness. Attention. Knowledge. We often
pass through a street without seeing or hearing things which are present before
the eye and the ear. A man spoke; but we say, "I am sorry, I did not hear him."
The speech was there: the sound waves impinged on the ear and yet we did not
hear. Why ? simply because we were absorbed otherwise. We were not. ie.. our
consciousness was not, attentive to it. This Attentiveness

 35 of consciousness is another great distinction between the living and the
lifeless. This attentiveness, of course, will be of as many different sorts as
there are activities of the senses, mind and the soul, of which we can be
conscious. We can be conscious of an object of sight, or of the other four
senses ; or of the soul itself directed to a material object or to its own
Omniscience. Thus our Attention also may be directed towards an ocular, or non-
ocular object, or towards the soul directly knowing a material object or full of
its own Omniscience. Notice also, that of necessity, this Attention is essential
to any kind of Knowledge. As a matter of fact, if we subject any piece of our
knowledge to deep analysis we can note the following stages. 1. To begin with
there is consciousness itself. This is the centre of life. It is life itself. It
is the first and unmistakeable characteristic of what is called soul. 2. It must
be Attentive to conate an object, i.e., to be inclined towards an object, i.e.,
to be merely turned towards it. 3. It must conate the object, i.e., it must be
aware that some object is present there, without determining anything more about
in the least. 4. Then it must attend to know that object in however slight a
detail. This is the Attentiveness which must proceed knowledge. * 5. Then a
detail is grasped and knowledge begins, when we know a thing, we are not
conscious of these 5 steps. But since our birth we are so much habituated to
gain knowledge by means of our senses and mind, that these 5 steps are a sort of
reflex or automatic, unconscious action of our busy consciousness. When we walk
even for miles, or see with our eyes, or wink or breathe, or our blood courses
in the body-we are seldom conscious of any of these things. They are familiar,
habituated, and reflex or unconcious actions, and therefore unobserved. But
their stages are all the same there. The alternate balancing of the whole body
on one foot, th bending forward, then balancing on the other and so on; the
closing of the eyelid to protect the eye; the inhalation of air to supply the
lungs with oxygen, the exhalation to put forth foul carbonic acid gas, etc.,
each little action with its minute process and delicate machinery is going on
without our attending to it, consciously. Infinitely, more delicate and
unobserved are the myriad th our mind, which we call our channel of knowledge
Only an Omniscient can see the millions of regular, natural processes by which
the smallest particle of knowledge is called into being. Familiarity

 36 has bred indifference amounting to ignorance in us. This psychic factory is
within our own bodies. Take an example :- 1. You are reading these words before
your eyes, if you are dead and unconscious you can never read the words although
they are before your eyes. There is no consciousness there. To be able to read
you must have consciousness If your thoughts are away, e.g. a siren song from
your neighbour fascinates you and you are all ear to it. You cannot read these
words, for your consciousness is not Attentive to the words. So attention is
needed. 3. When your attention is drawn to the words in the first instance,
there is merely a conation of them. You are merely conscious that something, not
words, but merely something is there. This is conation (Darshana). This precedes
knowledge. But it is most difficult to detect it or to describe it. It is itself
an indescribable stage of consciousness touching a knowable object. It is merely
a sort of is-ness of something of which your attentive consciousness is aware.
It is not knowledge; nor even the beginning of knowledge. It is merely a
preliminary, but a necessary prelimi. nary, to knowledge. 4. After this conation
by attentive consciousness, the consciousness is directed to know the thing. The
first instant witnesses the Attention of the consciousness shifted from conation
to knowled This attentiveness is the beginning of knowledge. After this,
knowledge begins. These stages are exceedingly difficult to analyse. Very
profound, patient and long practised self-analysis is needed to perfectly verify
them. But they are there. They may be sensed satisfactorily by any one who gives
sober, serious and staid thought to the grasping of them. From being aware of
the mere is-ness of something in the paper before you, you instantly are
conscious that there are some sort of letters there. Your mind questions? What
kind of letters ? The next instant answers: letters of the English Alphabet. You
impress this on your mind and record and retain it there for future use. This is
useful to you on future occasions. You may remember it, you may recognise it by
seeing these very words again or by seeing some others similar or dissimilar to
them. You may collect together many records like this and build up an induction
on the basis of them. From your induction you may deduce inferences.

 37 From all the above knowledge about the words you are reading, you may lead
yourself on to a knowledge of something else which is not in the words
themselves. So from the mere sense of having seen the words, i. e. from a merely
sensitive knowledge about them you may go on to think that they are
philosophical symbols and exclaim with Milton: "How charming is divine
philosophy, Nor harsh and crabbed, as dull fools suppose, But musical as is
Apollo's lute, And a perpetual feast of nectared sweets, Where no crude surfeit
reigns". Comus 11,476-480. If you analyse your experience about these words you
will easily perceive no less than thirteen distinct stages in it. 1.
Consciousness (Chetana). 2. Attention (Upa-yoga) of this consciousness towards
the conating (Darshana) of these words. 3. Conation (Darshana) itself i.e. the
awareness that something is there, 4. Attention (Upa-yoga) of consciousness to
know (Jnana) and to see. 5. Actual sight, (Avagraha) the preception that there
is something like words there. 6. The desire (iha) to know further the question
what letters are these. They seem to be English. It is the process through which
mere preception is transmuted into judgment; it is the conception and comparison
or pre-judgment or ratiocination. 7. The judgment, (Avaya), The answer; they are
English letters. The retention (Dharana), the fixing of the judgment in the
mind. 9. The memory (Smriti) of the words. 10. Their recognition (sanjna). 11.
The Induction (chinta) from them. 12. The deduction( Abhinibodha) and 13. The
Scriptural knowledge (Shruta) i. e. the extra knowledge of other things derived
through the sight of the script of the letters. It is easy to see that the first
four are pre-knowledge stages; and the next eight from 5th to 12th are stages of
degrees of sensitive knowledge, and the last is inferential knowledge, which may
be termed Scriptural knowledge. Consciousness may further know things directly
without the intermediation of the senses or the mind. The soul itself may
visualise matter directly or may visualise the impressions about it in the mind
of another. This kind of knowledge is very rare and can be understood only after
great profound study and longlived life of controlled discipline and purity.
Still more difficult to understand is Omniscience. I shall try to take the
reader up to it gradually, provided he is patient and dispassionately in search
of Truth, and

 38 not in the hurry to criticise, or dogmatise, to say "What is Truth,'' and
then Pilate-like to go away, 8 kinds of knowledge. One thing I may here say,
although it is obvious that Sensitive and Scriptural knowledge may go wrong.
Even Visual knowledge (direct vision of matter by the soul) may go wrong but
direct Mental knowledge of the mind of others and Perfect knowledge or
Omniscience cannot go wrong. Thus we may be said to have come to 8 kinds of
knowledge; five right and the first three wrong also. These are the first batch
of considerations of the great fact of consciousness in living matter. And we
must remember that each kind of conscious activity has its preliminary
Attentiveness. Thus we may sum up. Consciousness is Attentiveness of Conation or
of Knowledge, or Conation or Knowledge itself. Conation is for Ocular,
(Chakshu), Non-ocular (Achakshu), Visual (Avadhi), or Perfect (kevala)
Knowledge. Knowledge is Sensitive( Mati),Scriptural(Shruta),Visual( Avadhi),
Mental(Manah Paryaya) or Perfect (Kevala), also wrong Sensitive (Ku-Mati), wrong
Scriptural (Ku-Shruta), and wrong Visual(KuAvadhi)Knowledge. Let us illustrate
again. Consciousness which is the mighty, real characterstic of life is the
starting point. You must be alive to read these words. You must be attentive to
feel that something is there. You must conate these words. Then again you must
be attentive to perceive, then alone you begin to know them, i.e. have
perception, conception, judgment, retention, memory, recognition, induction, or
deduction from them. Roughly it may be said that attentiveness for conation or
knowledge of any kind is the first instant of conation or knowledge. As the name
implies it is the instant in which consciousness attends to conate or know an
object. Also obviously conation is a necessary preliminary to knowledge.
Consciousness is the most essential difference between the Living and Non-
Living. It deservedly detained us for a moment. But we must attend once more to
a distinction between the two mighty categories, the Living and the Non-living
Substances. We have seen that the first distinction is that the Living has and
the Non-living does not have the four or ten vitalities of the five senses; the
power of mind, speech and body; respiration ; and age. We found the second
distinction to be attentiveness of consciousness to four kinds of conation,
Ocular, Non-ocular, Visual and Perfect; and to eight kinds of knowledge,
Sensitive, Scriptural,

 39 and Visual of the right as well as wrong, Mental and Perfect, of the right
(kind only.) The Soul and the Body. We also saw that although Non-living
substance is found in fair abundance around us, living substance always seems to
be mixed up with non-living matter in the world. Popular phraseology teaches us
to call this non-living sheath of the living consciousness, its "body". "One
body, one soul " seems to be the general motto of the universe. There are
exceptions, but they need not detain us here. Botanical and other Scientific
researches have taught us the learning of parasits and their hosts; so one body
becomes the lodging of many souls. But to stick to popular parlance, one
unified, individual consciousness forms the ego or soul or "I" and it fills one
body. The crudest observation shows that this consciousness has the capacity of
completely filling the size of its particular body. The elephant has a conscious
individual soul ; so has an ant. So we may note as the third distinction between
life and lifeless matter that life has the capacity of completely filling its
lifeless sheath with consciousness, or in other words, or being coextensive with
its body. Notice also that the same grows fat on high living, or grows thin by
disease. Indeed the little new-born baby becomes a big boy, then a bigger
powerful man, and then a weak, emaciated old man; yet all through, the same one
individual consciousness completely fills the body in its different sizes. The
soul is capable of contraction and expansion. The Soul Arts and Enjoys. Look at
the living-non-living mixture from another point of view. We attribute activity
and enjoyment to it. We say of a man's act: What a good or bad thing he has
done. When a man acts without restraint or rashly and comes to grief, we say:
this is the fruit of his folly." If a man is good, and prosperous, we say: "Oh!
he does deserve it all and more." These popular phrases really have a
philosophical significance. They attribute responsibility and reward to our
consciousness. They imply that this consciousness is an active, responsible
agent; is the Doer of all actions; and is the Enjoyer of the fruits of these
actions, good or bad. It is necessary to remember these, lest we should fall
into the error of exempting the soul, ego or individual consciousness from all
responsibility for his actions, good or bad, and thus at one stroke uproot all
ethical distinctions and fullstop to discriminate actions.

 40 We must also draw a distinction between the actions and the inner activity,
to which these external actions are due. From the practical point of view we
must emphasise the external actions, and from the real point of view their
causes in the inner activity of our consciousness. But the responsible agent of
both these is the individual consciousness itself. Consciousness is as such
purely itself, i.e. quite separate from matter which is unconscious, lifeless.
From this pure or real point of view, we may say that all action and enjoyment
of the soul is within its own consciousness. The Soul is Immaterial. Once more
let us compare our categories, the Living and Nonliving. The most obvious form
of non-living substance is matter; as iron, dry wood, sapphire, stone wall, key
of our lock, our table, chair and innumerable other objects conveniently handy
for this investigation to anyone at all times and at all places. That is the
chief characterstic of this mass of matter of so many kinds? It is obviously
this: It can be known by the senses. It has colour; we can see that coal is
black; sapphire is blue; gold is yellow, ruby is red; and snow is white. Again
if we taste various kinds of matter we find that pepper is pungent, that aloes
is bitter, that salt is saline, that the juice of an unripe mango is acid, and
that sugar is sweet. Again rose essence smells sweet, Sulphur does not smell
nice. Also, iron is cold, dry wood is not compared with iron; silk is smooth;
sand is rough; cotton is soft; stone is hard; a feather is light and lead is
heavy. We can sum up these 5 colours, five tastes, two smells and eight touches
as the more obvious characteristics of lifeless matter. None of these twenty is
found to characterise Consciousness, or pure life. Of course when life is mixed
with non-living matter, it assumes all these distinctions of colour, taste,
smell, and touch. Thus embodied consciousness does have colour, taste, etc. Soul
is not matter. Byron rightly said that is the matter never mind him what is the
mind, no matter. By "mind" we must mean the taking Ego, the soul. Possibility of
Omniscience. This point is radical and deserves a little more consideration.
Above we have seen vitalities, attention, conation, knowledge, doing and
enjoying, and co-extension with the body to be the observed characteristics of
the living substance. Here we may pause for a moment to consider these
characteristics also. They were all

 41 derived from our observation of a dead corpse and a living reader of these
words. In the corpse, we simply noted the absence of the living and thus
indirectly inferred that what was absent, belonged to and was taken away by the
living substance when it left the corpse lifeless. The living reader gave us
mostly the psychic stages of conation and knowledge. But in all these we are not
able to study or observe pure life. Indeed it must be confessed frankly that
there is absolutely no means at present of our studying life or soul directly
and fully in its pure condition without any admixture of matter in it. We are in
the world. There is no pure soul in this world of ours. All are embodied or
mundane souls. In studying them, except in abstract thought, we cannot separate
the living soul from its sheath of non-living matter, i. e., the body. But the
living embodied soul also can exhibit in the world such a high degree of
manifestation of pure life and independence of nonliving matter, that we can
form a very near idea, of a pure perfect soul. As we approach that idea we find
that vitalities, and responsibility for doing and enjoying shrink more and more;
and that conation and knowledge correspondingly increase in purity, extent,
depth and fineness. From this it is justifiable to conclude that the ultimate
idea of a perfect soul, i.e., the ideal soul will be identical with an
individual consciousness which has perfect conation and perfect knowledge with
their attendant perfect power and perfect bliss. Also that this stage must mean
total separation or liberation from matter. Thus alone from a consideration of
the obvious categories, of the living substance and non-living substance,
gradually, and after very deep, persistent, patient, difficult, and long study
and contemplation we can arrive at a conception of a Pure Soul, the Highest
Self, the Ideal, God, or whatever other name you like. Living substance rises
higher and higher towards the condition of matterless living, and ultimately,
when perfectly rid of matter, it attains an eternal condition of Pure Light in
Self-Absorption and by nature ascends upwards to the top of universe. There is
no turning back, and no further bondage with matter, and no transmigrations. Its
modifications there, consist of its own perpetual self-modification. It has
perfect conation and perfect knowledge. It is itself. It is liberated. It is
Pure Soul. But excepting this condition of absolute purity, the soul's own pure
qualities are effected by those of matter. So we find that attention, conation
and knowledge, which are pure consciousness or its modifications, are observed
in a mundane or embodied soul, to

 42 exist along with vitalities, and the size of the body, and are responsible
for sowing and reaping the fruit of action, which are the characteristics of the
living being united with the non-living matter and with touch, taste, smell and
colour the pure characterstics of non-living matter. The whole picturesque and
endless variety of life, - physical, mental and emotional life in the universe
is the effect and summation of infinite ways in which the Living unites with the
Nonliving. Let us try to consider this glorious wealth of variegated life of
souls in the universe. The whole universe is packed full of living creatures.
Indeed in such out-of-the-way and unexpected places, does our knowing
intelligence light upon life, that some Great Intellects have gone the length of
saying that all is Life and there is no lifeless matter at all. This of course
is easily refuted by common, everybody, universal observation. In comprehending
the almost incomprehensible vastnesses of space and time and their contents let
us keep a cool and dispassionate head lest in our admiration of one or other of
the several constituents of the universe, we should deny one or more and thus
cripple our further and full knowledge of the whole truth of things. Indeed the
checking of our premises and first conclusions again and again is absolutely
essential if we, imperfect human beings, want to gain right knowledge. The
search after Truth is not a child's play: the path to it is more narrow to
traverse than the passage of the camel through the eye of the needle in the
Bible. The universe, then, teems with infinite living forms. How to observe,
analyse, and classify them, so that we can advance on the path of our
tremendous, trackless inquiry? I propose to take this matter up in three
different ways. 1. Souls classes (Jiva Samasa). There are obvious differences of
body, sense and mind in different classes of souls: The body is primarily the
basis of this classification. This in Jainism is technically called soul-
classes. (Jiva Samasa). 2. Soul-quest (Margana). It comprises other inner
differences in species, sex, passion, knowledge, conation etc., - In soul-quest,
the embodied condition of the soul, (i.e.) the mixed living and nonliving
condition is primarily the basis. 3. Spiritual Stages (Gunasthana). They concern
the purelyinner progress of the soul. In these spiritual stages, the progress of
the soul from ignorance and delusion to perfect self-absorption is traced.

 43 1. Jiva Samasa-Soul-classes. From the protoplasm of the germ-cell to a full-
blown human being, there is an infinite number of mundane souls or living beings
in the universe. The protoplasm so far as is known at present, has no ears to
hear, no eyes to see, no nose to smell, no tongue to taste ; it has only the
sense of touch. The human being has all the five senses fully developed and
distinct, and a mind also which is also a sort of additional and higher sense (a
quasi-sense), the organ of which sense is invisible to us. In Jainism, it is an
organ which is made up of subtle matter called Manovargana, or mental matter.
Its form is like a lotus with eight petals near the heart. Dr. Robert Bell has
long held the theory that the solar plexus is the real centre of mental
activity. Professor Troude and eminent war-surgeons dispute the brain as the
seat of mental activity. In war time operations, brains were removed without
impairing the mental faculties. (The Leader, November 12, 1920, page 7, Col. 3).
Thus we can divide mundane souls into 6 classes :1 With the sense of touch only
fine. , & taste gross. >> >> >> & smell & sight ... " & hearing , ,, ,, ,, &
mind , Fine-one sensed souls cannot be known by our senses. They can penetrate
all matter. They are everywhere in the universe. They are not obstructed by, and
they do not obstruct others. They die their own death. Some of the above 7 kinds
are born with the capacity to develop, others die before acquiring the capacity
to develop. Each one of the 7 may therefore be developable or non-developable.
Thus there may be said to be 14 soul-classes in all. Here another distinction
may be considered. Some mundane souls when attacked or in fear of something or
some-one, can voluntarily change their place in space. A man attacked with a
sword or by a lion can run away from the lion or his assailant. So a dog, cat,
pigeon, butterfly, maggot, or the finest animalculce which we can see, runs away
from the vicinity of danger and death. It is merely a paraphrase of the
universal instinct of self-preservation. But it is evident that a blade of
grass, a huge oak, or banyan or a stone growing in a quarry cannot run away
before the scythe, axe, or spade which threatens to put an end to its life. This

 44 7 "" city to be able to take one's body from one place to another divides
souls in the universe into Immobiles, like stones in quarry, vegetables, trees,
etc., and mobiles like men, animals, birds, etc. Observation will show that all
one-sensed souls are immobile, incapable of voluntary change of place; and that
all the other souls are mobile, who can at will run away from danger or death.
The classes are said to be 14 in Gatha 72 : 57 ir Gatha 73: 98 in Gatha 79 and

 47 The following points as to the soul-Classes may be explained for the reader
who is not familiar with the technicalities of Jainism. NIGODA (VEGETABLE)
KINGDOM. Sadharana, or Common, or Group-Souled Vegetables. The Universe is 14
Rajus high, 7 Rajus at the base, with a thickness which at the base is 7 Rajus,
then gradually decreases to one Raju at a height of 7 Rajus, i.e. at the Middle
of the Universe, where the Middle World, i.e. the region of the human and
subhuman beings, is situated. Then it gradually grows to a thickness of 5 Rajus
at the point where the sixth Heaven ends, and which marks the Middle of the
Upper World, or the region of Heavenly beings; finally it gradually decreases to
a thickness of one Raju at the top of the Universe, i.e., 14 Rajus high above
the base, 7 Rajus high above the Middle World, and 3) Rajus high above the sixth
Heaven. It is here, that the Siddha Kshetra, or the Region of the eternally
liberated Souls is situated. This is at the top of the Universe. (See Map at the
end of this Introduction). "Nigoda" beings are of two kinds, fine and gross.
Fine Nigoda Living beings exist everywhere in the Universe, from the nethermost
hell to the highest region of the eternally liberated souls. They are one-
sensed, both developable and undevelopable, take birth and die 18 times in the
short interval of time taken by one pulse-beat of an average human being. Of
course, being souls, they have knowledge, but this knowledge, preceded by its
conation, is limited to the sense of touch. These Nigoda souls are neither
earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied, nor air-bodied. They belong to the
vegetable sub-classes of the Immobile class of souls : They have one body,
occupied by many souls which are born, which live, and which die together. These
group-souls are of two kinds : (1) Those who have never left Nigoda. These are
called Nitya Nigoda, ever-one-body-many-souled. (2) Those who left Nigoda and
became embodied in higher forms of soul-classes, but have come down to Nigoda
once more. These are called Itara Nigoda, or Chaturgati Nigoda. One-body many-
souled. These two are also called Sadharana, or "Common" or GroupSoul-classes of
vegetables. Pratyeka or Individual-Souled Vegetables. Other vegetables have one
body and one soul only. They are called individual-souled or
Individual(Pratyeka)vegetables. These are always gross, and never fine. But
these again may or may not have parasites or hosts. Thus there are 2 kinds : (1)
Sapratishthita, or Host-one-souled vegetables. (2) Apratishthita, or Non-host-
one-souled vegetables.

 48 Each one of these two, being either a Trunk, Creeper, Plant, Tree, or Root,
there are 10 classes of these individual-souled-vegetables, so-called in
contrast to common or group-souled vegetables. Bhoga-Bhumi (Enjoyment Region).
The Jaina conception of the Middle World is that it is entirely confined to the
one Raju square of the layer of the Mobile Channel (Trasa Nadi), at a height of
7 Rajus from the base of the Universe. This Middle World consists of concentric
rings of successive Continents and Oceans. Each succeeding ring has a width
double of the ring-width of its predecessor. In the centre of the Middle World
there is the first Continent Jambudvipa, of a diameter of one lac (1,00,000)
Yojanas. It has in its centre the Sumeru mountain, which has a height of
1,00,040 Yojanas, 40 Yojanas of which form the top, and 1,000 Yojanas of which
are embedded in the earth as the sub terranean foundation of the Mountain, and
which has a circular base of the diameter of 10,000 Yojanas. The Ocean, Lavana,
next to Jambudvipa and encircling it all round is a ring with a width of 2 lac
Yojanas. The next Dhatu ki Khanda, is a continent, a ring with a width of 4 lac
Yojanas. The next Kalodadhi is the Second Ocean with a ring-width of 8 lac
Yojanas. The next Pushkaravara Dvipa, is the third Continent with a ring-width
or 16 lac Yojanas. And so on, till through innumerable Continents and Oceans we
reach the last pair of rings, the the Svyambhu Ramana Ocean. This is the last
ring of water holding our Middle World in its embrace. It is to be noted that
the third Continent Pushkara-Vara-Dvipa has a circular mountain bisecting it
equally throughout the width of its ring. This mountain is called Manushottara,
Cis-human, as there are no human beings beyond its limits nor can any human
beings go beyond its limits. Thus the human regions are a circle of 45 lacs of
Yojanas, and comprise the first two oceans and the first two and a half
Continents. It is noticeable that in Jainism there are 5 regions, each with a
diameter of 45 lacs of Yojnas. (1) The above human region is called the 2
Dvipas. (2) As Nirvana is attained only from the human regions, the Siddha
Kshetra at the top of the Universe also is a region with a diameter of 45 lac
Yojanas. (3) So is Siddha Shila, the earth below the Siddha Kshetra. (4) The
first Indraka-Vimana or central celestial Car or residence, just one hair's
breadth above the apex of Sumeru.

 49 VI. (5) The first Indraka Bila or Central hellish hole or resid. ence of the
denizens of hell in the first layer of hell, one lac Yojanas below our earth. It
is also interesting to note that there are 3 regions with a diameter of 1 lac
Yojanas, and 2 regions with a height and thickness of the same extent
respectively, (1) Jambudvipa, the first Continent in the centre of the middle
World. (2) The last Indraka Vimana or central celestial Car or residence in
Sarvartha Siddhi in the last or 3rd layer of the Upper World. (3) The last
Indraka Bila, or Central hellish hole, or residence of the denizens of hell in
the last or 49th layer of hell in the seventh earth in the Lower World. (4) The
height of Mount Sumeru minus its top of 40 Yojanas. (5) The thickness of the
first Earth from its crust at the Middle World down to the end of the second
part ; Panka Bhaga, i. e., just before the beginning of the first layer of the
first hell is also 1 lac Yojanas. Now the Central or first Continent, Jambu
Dvipa, has a diameter of one lac Yojanas. This is divided into 7 Countries
(Kshetra) each separated from the other by a mountain (Kulachala). Thus we have
7 countries and 6 mountains. The first is a Country; the second, a mountain and
so on. Each succeeding division has double the width of its predecessor, till we
reach Videha, the central region round Sumeru, from where the width begins to be
half of its predecessor. Thus arithmetically the divisions are 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,
32,16,8,4,2,1, a total of 190 units. The countries in the extreme north and
south being each of one unit have a width of one lac Yojanas divided by 190 i.e.
526. great Yojanas. The second, third and fourth Countries have respectively 4,
16, and 64, units of width; as also the corresponding countries in the North,
counting North to South, i,e, in each case from Lavana Ocean to Mount Sumeru. In
these 3 pairs of Countries there are the three Bhog Bhumis or Enjoyment-Lands,
being the Lowest (Jaghanya), Middle (Madhyama), and the Highest (Utama) Bhoga-
Bhumis, respectively. In Videha, however, the Eastern and Western Countries,
beyond the Eastern and Western Limits of the Bhadra Shala forest, are Karma
Bhumi. The rest alone, i.e. the region immediately round Sumeru is the Highest
Bhoga Bhumi. The region in the North

 is called Uttara Kuru, that in the South Deva Kuru, Bhoga Bhumi. In 32
countries of Videha, and in the rest of the Continent there is Karma Bhumi or
Work-Region, where people have to depend on agriculture etc. for their living.
In Enjoyment Region, they have no work to do, they get all that they want from
Kalpa Vrikshas, wishing-trees, never have disease or accidents, and live the
full span of their lives. The least happiness of a man in Bhoga Bhumi is
infinite times the happiness of a Chakravarti. It is very significant that the
islanders of Java have a word in their language denoting an Enjoyment-Land. Is
it that the Jaina missionaries and colonists penetrated into these islands,
centuries and centuries ago, and left the tradition of their Bhoga-Bhumi there?
Kubhoga-Bhumi (Distorted or Improper Enjoyment-Region). In the Lavana Ocean,
round Jambudvipa, and in Kalodadhi round Dhatu ki Khanda, there are 96 islands;
48 in each, 24 on each shore of the Ocean. They are inhabited by ill formed
persons (kumanushya) with disproportionate (hundaka) bodies. All of them have an
age of one Palya. These people also do not have any agriculture etc. and live,
some on mud and some on fruits. They have no Wishing-trees. As they have no arts
of agriculture etc., they are called people of Bhoga Bhumi, but as their life is
low and savage-like and their forms improper and distorted, the land is called
Ku-Bhoga Bhumi or wrong, distorted or improper Enjoyment-Land. Paryapti
(Developableness). The Chapter on Paryapti (Developableness) in Jainism is
interesting, but not free from intricacy. It is dealt with in Jiva Kanda Chapter
III Gathas 118-128; and is followed by an account of prana (Vitality) in Chapter
IV (Gathas) 129-133. Biologists and Zoologists alone can say if it is capable of
being subjected to experiments. But the briefest Jaina account is this. The
newly born soul is incomplete, but has the capacity to become complete, in
assimilation, body, senses, respiration, speech, and mind. The comple: tion of
the capacity to develop these 6 assimilation etc., makes the 6 Paryaptis. When a
soul goes from one condition of existen another, it assimilates the molecules of
aharaka matter, and also of speech matter in the case of more than one-sensed,
and of mindmatter in the case of rational beings. The aharaka molecules form the
physical body of human and sub-human beings, the fluid (Vaik

 51 riyaka, transformable) body of celestial and hellish beings, and the
assimilative body in case of saints. These molecules must be reduced to a
primary solid and liquid form. The completion of the capacity to do it is the
Assimilative (Aharaka) Development. The solid portions develop into bone etc.,
hard substances, and the liquid into blood, bile etc. the fluid substances of
the body. The completion of the capacity to do it, is the body (Sharira)
Development. The molecular matter assimilated by the soul is further formed into
senseorgans, the completion of the capacity to do it is the sense (Indriya)
Development. The wear and tear of the body is made up by ceaseless Respiration.
The completion of the capacity for respiration is the Ana-pana-Development. The
completion of the capacity to form speech-molecules and mind-molecules into
speech and mind, is respectively the speech and mind Development. The beginning
of the acquiring of 4, 5 or 6 capacities is simultaneous; but their completion
is in the order in which they are named above. And from the first kind each
successive development takes more time to complete itself than its predecessor.
But each one individually, and all the 6 collectively never take more than one
(Antara muhurta, the minimum of which is one wink (Avali) and one instant
(Samaya), and maximum is 48 minutes minus one instant. But a completely
undevelopable (Labdhi-aparyaptaka) soul does not complete its capacities to
develop, and dies within one antar-muhurta, which is one eighteenth of one
pulse-beat. The Nuclei (Yonis). The Yoni is the womb or other physical centre or
nucleus where the incarnating soul find its lodgment at conception. According to
Jainism, such a nucleus may be cold, hot, covered or open, living or non-living,
or a combination of these 3 pairs. Thus primarily yonis are of 9 kinds. But with
their classes and sub-classes they are 84 lacs. The 84 lacs of nuclei for birth
of souls are as follows:One-Sensed beings: Earth-bodied Water-bodied Fire-bodied
Air-bodied Vegetables Non-one-souled. Ever-one-body-many-souled Other-one-body-
many-souled ... ... *** .. 7,00,000 7,00,000 7,00,000 7,00,000 7,00,000 7,00,000

what different ways we search for a mundane soul? We can do so in no less than
14 different ways. 1. Four conditions of Existence (Gati). We may see whether it
is a human, or a sub-human soul on earth; or it is a non-human soul above or
under the earth. These latter are the celestial and hellish beings. All ancient
systems of thought posited their existence. We cannot see them today. But there
is nothing inherently impossible in the conception of these forms of living
beings, who live, think, and feel and can change their bodies at will, as
described by Milton in his "Paradise Lost." This Quest may be called Condition
of Existence (Gati). 2.-Five Senses (Indriya). The 5 senses give us another kind
of Quest, called the SenseQuest. 3.-Six Embodiments (Kaya). The different kinds
of embodiments of immobile and mobile souls furnish another kind of Quest. It is
open to observation that the body of a vegetable and the body of a man are
radically different. Ultimately as matter, they may be, and are the same. But
their difference is equally marked. Their constitution and composition are
different. Their Chemical characteristics vary. They occupy obviously different
places in the whole range of living beings. It is on this basis that people are
split up into vegetarians and non-Vegetarians. Vegetarians give up taking lives
higher than non-vegetables, because animals are more evolved and their bodies
approximate our own bodies more than the bodies of vegetables do.

 53 Non-injury (Ahimsa). I may be allowed to digress here. Live and let live is
as simple a motto of life as it is Profound. No one has a right to destroy any
life. Every one has a right to live. Now the curious thing is that Life thrives
on life. No living being can continue its life without another life being
destroyed. How to reconcile these two facts: the duty of not-taking another's
life and the right of preserving one's own, which necessitates destruction of
other life? The reconciliation can be effected by interpreting these two sister
precepts in a possible practical way, and not in an impossible Antinomian
fashion. "The ideal practice of non-injury is possible only to the soul in its
perfect condition, i. e. when it has freed itself from the last particle of
matter (Karma Varganas). On this side of that happy state, do whatever we will,
some life must be transformed into our life in order to sustain it. Therefore
what is meant and enjoined is simply this, "Do not destroy life, unless it is
absolutely necessary for the maintenance of a higher kind of life." The purer
souls will, of course, not like to sanction even this. But as formulated above,
the rule does not sanction hurting or injury: it limits it to the lowest
possible minimum. As a supplementary rule we have: "And then begin with the
least evolved kind of life, for example, with the sthavars (immobiles)." (See
Outlines of Jainism p. 71). Destruction of any one or more of the 10 vitalities
is injury. The extent of injury varies with the number of vitalities injured
Immobiles possess four, the least number of vitalities. Mobiles have from 6 to
10 vitalities. In the soul-classes above we found souls to be mobile or
immobile. The immobiles are one-sensed beings and have for their bodies
vegetables, air, fire, water or earth. Science every day is making progress in
discovering these tiny and ultra-microscopic fellowbeings of ours. Plants are
credited with conscious life now. Much that was considered inorganic is found in
the light of greater knowledge to be organic. Air and fire, water and earth, are
the bodies of innumerable living beings. From this point of view we can search a
soul in 6 kinds of embodiment; earth, water, fire, air, vegetable and mobile.
4.- Fifteen Vibratory Activities (Yoga). 4. All activity of the body, speech,
and mind is the cause of the inner modifications or vibrations of life or our
vital consciousness. Thus our mundane life is continued. An angry thought, a
noble

======================
 impulse, the passion of patriotism, and infinity of movements of body, speech
and mind produce almost visible changes in matter. There is a constant
circulation, action, and reaction between these outward acts and the inner
consciousness-vibrations, of which the external vibrations are the cause. Our
speech, or thoughts may be true or false, a mixture of both or neither. This
gives us eight kinds. Our body has several inter-penetrating sheaths of the
outer body, electric and the karmic body. Their activity can be distinguished in
no less than 7 ways. Thus the Vibration-Quest gives us 15 main kinds (for
details see Gatha 216 et seq. 5.-Three sex-inclinations. (Veda). Every soul has
the instinct of propagation. Life reproduces itself. This is due to sex-impulse.
This takes three wel forms, male, female, or common. We can search soul in these
three sex distinctions. 6.-The 25 Passions. (Kashaya). As soon as we take up any
manifestation of the consciousness, volition of a soul, we can easily trace it
to some passion or other in the consciousness. If we observe and analyse many of
these manifestations, we find that they are due to the four passions of Anger,
Pride, Deceit, and Greed, or their combinations. Again it is noticeable that
there are innumerable degrees of each one of these passions. Take Anger. It may
be so intense as to blind one and to last a long, long time. It may possess one
in an extreme and erroneous form. It may only mean a loss of all restraint. It
may prevent only partial restraint. Or it may be a transient feeling, which may
disturb the perfect equanimity of the soul for a moment. From these four broad
degrees, we may say the four passions to be of 16 kinds. Other minor passions
are also noticeable (e. g.) laughter (hasya), indulgence (rati), ennui (arati),
sorrow (shoka), fear (bhaya), disgust (jugupsa) and the masculine, feminine and
common sex inclinations. This Quest may be called the Passion-Quest. 7.-Eight
Quests of Knowledge (Jnana). Knowledge has been considered above in its five
right kinds of sensitive, scriptural, visual, mental, and perfect ; and three
wrong kinds of sensitive, scriptural and visual. These 8 kinds give the 8 Quests
of Knowledge. 8.Six controls (Sanyama). Some souls have no control at all.
Others have some sort of part control, part non-control. Some have more control
than

Page #66 (AI-GENERATED, RESEARCH USE ONLY):

======================
 55 others. They have equanimity; or have recovered it after losing it; or have
a control which implies pure and absolute non-injury to other souls; they may be
all but passionless; or they may be entirely ideal and passionless. So
Shakespeare says : - "Give me that man That is not passion's slave and I will
wear him. In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart." (Hamlet. Act IV Sc. 2.)
The above 6 degrees of control give us the Quest of souls with regard to their
control. 9. Four conation-quests (Darshana.) The four kinds of co-nation,
ocular, non-ocular, visual, and perfect given before form the Conation-Quest.
10.-Six-Thought-Paints (Leshya). Every-thing which is matter, or mixed up with
matter has some kind or other of touch, taste, smell and colour. Our mind and
its activity are no exception. They are material and have colour, which they
change with every change of their thought activity. A black-hearted man; red
with rage; pale with fear; green with jealousy ;-these are familiar phrases. Our
thoughts and emotions have a very intimate connection with colours. We may be
said to have thought-paints. There are innumerable intermediate characters of
paints: but the primary ones are black, blue, grey, yellow, pink or red and
white. These 6 form the Soul Quest as to Thought-paint. The Leshyas are the
Soul's vibrations effected by mild and strong passions. 11.-Liberability
(Bhavyatva). You may seek souls in two classes; those who are capable of
Liberation and those who are not capable of Liberation. The capacity of
Liberation is the basis of this Quest. 12,Six Beliefs (Samyaktva). No living
being is without some kind of creed, set of beliefs. He may or may not realise
or analyse them. He may or may not express them to himself or any one else; but
there they are in his inner being always. Matter deludes the belief and conduct
of the soul. But when matter subsides or entirely falls off, we have flashes of
right faith and righteous conduct. This right belief may be due to the
subsidence or destruction or part-destruction part-subsidence of the matter
which keeps it submerged and deluded.

======================
| Romanization (original text) |
======================
 56 Three stages of this right belief are noticeable. To begin with, there is
its absence, i.e., there is wrong belief. Then you may acquire right belief but
lose it and slip from it to wrong belief, the condition of your belief during
downfall. Thirdly, the condition of mixed right and wrong belief. The above 2
triads give us 6 classes. These may be called Subsidential, Destructive,
Destructive-Subsidential, Wrong belief, downfall belief and mixed right wrong
belief. Here right belief is the basis of the Quest. 13.- Mind-Quest (Sanjna).
Souls have mind or not. They are Rational or Irrational. This is the Rationality
Quest. 14.-Assimilation-Quest (Anara). Souls are in an incarnation, as
celestial, human, sub-human, and hellish being; there they are assimilating
particles of matter for their physical bodies every instant. But in
transmigration from one condition of existence to another there is no
assimilation of matter of physical body. This distinction gives us the
Assimilation Quest. That is, souls are : (1) those who are assimilating matter
of their birth bodies (Aharaka Vargana); or (2) those who are not so
assimilating it, i.e., in transmig ration in the three instants of omniscient
overflow in the 13th stage, and in the 14th stage. III.-Spiritual Stages. If we
mark the freedom of pure soul from the impurifying bondage of matter we notice
14 stages. 1. The soul has delusion. It has wrong belief. (Mithyatva). 2. It had
Right Belief, but it is falling from that to Wrong Belief. This is the Downfall
Stage. (Sasadana). 3. It is in a stage of Mixed Right and Wrong Belief.
(Mishra). 4. It has Right Belief; but does not act upon it; does not resolve or
vow to follow it in actual life. It is Vowless Right Belief. (Avirata
Samyaktva). 5. It may follow it by partial vows. We may call it the partial Vow-
stage. (Desha-Vrata): 6. It may be with all possible vows, but may keep them
imperfectly. Owing to negligence or illness (Pramada). Call it the partial Vow-
stage. Pramatta-vrata). 7. If it has all Vows and keeps them perfectly, we have
the Perfect Vow-stage. (Apramatta virata),

Page #68 (AI-GENERATED, RESEARCH USE ONLY):
---------------------------



======================
| Romanization (original text) |
======================
 57 8. When all vows are kept perfectly, then new inner progress begins. The
soul has a new inner thought-activity. Call it the New Thought-Activity (Apurva-
Karana). 9. Further advance gives us the Advanced Thought-Activity stage
(Nirvritti-Karana). 10. Then we near the Goal. Delusion is leaving us. When it
has all but left us, call it the stage of Slightest Delusion (Sukshama-
Samparaya). 11. If all Delusion has entirely subsided, we call the stage one of
Subsided Delusion (Upashanta-moha). 12. If Delusion is destroyed, we are in the
stage of Destroyed Delusion (Kshina moha). 13. Then the soul knows all, sees
all. Still it has the body of its last incarnation and it vibrates as every body
does at every instant. We call this the stage of Vibratory Omniscience
(Sayogakevali). 14. When the body vibrations stop, the stage is of nonVibratory
Omniscience. It is of a short duration, and is called Ayoga-Kevali. Then the
soul is at the end of its mundane existence and becomes liberated from all
Karmic matter for ever; and rushes upward to enjoy its own eternal, supra-
sensual, undisturbable, Infinite Bliss along with Infinite Knowledge, Conation,
Perfect Right Belief, and Power. It is Siddha. It is itself. The goal is
reached. The ideal is realised. It is the acme of Fineness. It has no high or
low class, because all pure souls are the same. It is interpenetrable with them.
There is no struggle for existence; because there is pure and full existence for
all. It dropped its last body for ever and thus has a size slightly less than
that. It has reached the end of the Universe and is steady there. Its
modifications are its own perpetual continuous self-modifications. In the 14
stages it is noticeable that our progress is from Wrong-Belief to Right-Belief,
then to Vows, then to perfectly careful Vows, then to Passionlessness and then
to a cessation of the Vibratory Activity of Body, Speech, and Mind, which
induces the inflow of matter into the soul. In other words, we are beset by 5
kinds of innate evils or imperfections. These are Wrong-belief, Vowlessness,
Carelessness, Passion and Vibratory Activity. We shed Wrong-belief at the end of
the first. Vowlessness at the end of the fourth, Carelessness at the end of the
6th and Passions at the end of the tenth, and Vibratory Activity at the end of
the thirteenth stage.

 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. Qualities (Guna).-This indicates the three
jewels : right beliet, right knowledge, and right conduct, which jointly
characterise a Liberated Soul. Jewels (Ratna).- The above three Jewels (ratna-
traya) are meant. Descriptive (Prarupanam) - The part describing the soul, i.e.,
(Jiva Kanda) the name of the book. (Gunaratna bhusanodayam).-In which treatise
appear the brilliant three Jewels and infinite other attributes of a Perfect
Soul. Nemi.- Lord Nemi, the 22nd Tirthamkara is adored in this (Gatha) because
the temple named (Mahaputa) (lit. very pure) at Sravanabelgola (also called
Gommata Svami), contains the image of Lord Nemi. This Mahaputa was built by Raja
Chamunda Raya, Minister of Maharaja Raja-Malla Deva, of the Ganga dynasty.
RajaMalla was a pupil of the Saint Simha Nandi, In a book there are 6 parts.
Invocation (Mangala); Occasion of writing it (Nimitta); Object (Hetu); Extent,
number of (Gathas), etc.,(Parimana); name of book (nam a); and Author (Karta).
In this book, Gatha 1 is the invocation to Lord Nemi. The occasion was the
question put to the author Sri Nemi Chandra by Chamunda-Raya. The question was:
How does the body-making (Nama) Karma exist in fine (sukshma) non-developable
(aparyapta,) earth-bodied souls, etc. ? The object is to propagate the tradition
of Truth from master to pupil. The number of Gathas in Jiva Kanda is 735. The
name is Jiva Kanda. The author is the Saint, Nemi Chandra Siddhanta Chakravarti.
Gommata Sara is also called (Pancha Sangraha), a collection of five topics : 1.
That which is bound, i.e., the Soul (Bandhaka); 2. That which is bound to the
soul (Badhyamana); 3. That which binds (Bandha Svami); 4. The varieties of
bondage (Bandha Bheda); - 5. The cause of bondage (Bandha Hetu). The first of
these, namely, (Bandhaka) i. e., the mundane soul forms the subject-matter of
Jiva Kanda (Jivasya Praru panam, description of the soul.) The other four form
the subject-matter of Karma Kanda.

 GOMMATASARA. The age (Ayuh) vitality is included in the condition of existence
soul-quest, because they always co-exist. They begin together and end together.
The age Karma determines the duration of the particular condition of existence
in which the mundane soul is found; and the duration of the condition of
existence is exactly the length of time that the age Karma lasts. Thus evidently
the age vitality is the vitality which is co-existent with, and therefore.
included in, the condition of existence. The 14 soul-classes are evidently
included in the 5 senses, and 6 embodiment soul-quests. The gross and fine
immobile (Sukshma and Vadara Sthavara) souls are included in one sensed beings.
The rational (Sanjni) and irrational (Asanjni) mobile (Trasa) souls are included
in the five-sensed beings. The 6 kinds of capacity to develope (Paryapti) are
included in the 5 senses and 6 embodiment soul-quests, because the development
has reference to one or more of the 5 senses and 6 embodiments. The three
vitalities, respiration, speech-power, and mind-power are respectively the
effect of the last three of the 6 capacities to develope. The capacities being
included in the sense and embodiment soul-quests, the vitalities are also
included in the same. The body-power vitality is the cause of vibratory
activities, (Yoga) of 7 embodiments (Kaya); therefore this vitality is included
in the embodiment-vibratory-activity soul-quest. Coition animate-feeling is
dependent upon sexes, therefore it is included in the sex soul-quest. Fear
animate-feeling is included in the passions of anger and pride as, on ultimate
analysis, these two passions, in some form or other, are involved in it.
Similarly hunger animate feeling is included in the passions of deceit and
greed. Worldly attachment animate-feeling is evidently included in the passion
of greed. The 5 sense-vitalities and definite (knowledge) conscious
attentiveness are included in their effects, (the 8 kinds of knowledge,) in the
knowledge soul-quest; similarly indefinite conscious attentiveness is included
in the conation soul-quest.

Commentary. Operation, etc., (Udayadi). - 5 kinds of thought-activities are
recognised in Jainism. I.-Subsidential (Aupashamika). This arises by the
subsidence (Upashama) of the deluding (Mohaniya) Karmic matter. It is of 2
kinds. II.Destructive (Kshayika). It arises from the destruction of 4
obstructive (Ghatiya) Karmas. It is of 9 kinds. III.- Destructive-subsidential
(Kshyayopashamic). It arises by partial destruction, partial subsidence, and
partial operation of the destructive Karmas. It is of 18 kinds. IV.- Operative
(Audayika). It arises by the operation of the Karmas. It is of 21 kinds. V. -
Natural (Parinamika). This activity consists of the self-modification of the
soul. It is of 3 kinds. Thus the total number of kinds of thought-activity is
53. (Vide Tattvartha Sutra Chapter II, Sutras 1 to 6). The possession of a
different set of thought-activities distinguishes one class of souls from
another. The different classes are called the different spiritual stages or
(Gunasthana). miccho sAsaNa misso aviradasammo ya desavirado y|| viradA pamatta

spiritual stages (Jiva Samasa-Gunasthana) one after another. After the last, the
souls become liberated (Siddha). Commentary. The first four are vowless
(Avirta); and the fifth, and all the following are vowful (Virata) stages. The
13th and all that precede it are with vibratory activity (Sayogi). The fourth
and the following are the stages of the Conqueror (Jina), because the soul in
the 4th stage has conquered the right-belief-deluding Karma (Darshana Mohaniya)
i. e., the Karma which deludes the soul from right belief. In reality the
different thought-activities are innumerable. But as there are some prominent
ones, commonly found in mundane souls, we are enabled to classify them into 14
stages. micche khalu odaio vidiye puNa pAraNAmio bhaavo| misse khobasamio

Beyond this (i. e., the 7th stage), in the (4) subsidential stages, (i. e., the
Sth, 9th, 10th and 11th) the thought-activity (is) subsidential, and in the (4)
destructive stages (i. e., 8th, 9th, 10th and 12th), and up to end of the non-
vibrating omniscient stage, (i. e., in the 13th and 14th), and in the liberated
soul (there is) necessarily the - destructive" thought-activity. Commentary. The
7th stage of perfect vows (Apramatta-Virata) is of two kinds; ordinary perfect
vows. (Svas-thana-Appramatta), in which the soul wavers to and fro between the
perfect and the imperfect vow stages, i. e., constantly comes down to the 6th
and then goes back to the 7th stage; or extraordinary perfect vow (Satishaya
Appramatta) in which the soul can go beyond the 7th stage. This the soul can do
along two ladders, subsidential ladder (Upashama Shreni) or destructive ladder
(Kshayika Shreni). The ascent along the subsidential ladder, as the name
implies, is when the thoughtactivity is due to the subsidence of the matter of
the right-conduct-deluding Karma. The ascent from the extraordinary perfect vow,
(Satishaya Apramatta), 7th stage is as follows:-First to the stage of New-
thought-activity (Apurva Karana) 8th stage; then to-Advanced-thought-activity
(Anivritti Karana), the 9th stage ; then Slightest-delusion (Sukshma Samparaya),
the 10th stage ; and then to Subsided-delusion (Upashanta Moha), the 11th stage.
Along the subsidential ladder the soul cannot advance further: The duration of
the soul's stay in this stage is one antarmuhurta, i.e., from one avali plus one
Samaya up-to 48 minutes minus one Samaya. After this very short sojourn in the
11th stage, the soul must gradually come down to any of the lower stages. Ascent
along the destructive ladder, as the name implies, is when the thought-activity
is due to destruction of the matter of the right-conduct-deluding Karma. In this
ladder, the ascent from the 7th extraordinary stage is as follows:New-thought-
aetivity, . uages.

that in this ascent, the soul does not touch the 11th stage, which is the
peculiar and direct effect of the subsidential-thought-activity; but goes from
the 10th direct to the 12th stage, delusionless. This is the effect of
destroying the deluding Karma which can no more rise to delude the soul.
Therefore, evidently, there can be no fall from this stage: once arrived here.

 GOMMATASARA. 13 Tapasa, and doubtful belief (Samshaya) as in the followers of
Indra, (etc.), also indiscriminate belief (Ajnana) as in the followers of
Maskari (etc.) Commentary. Clear, reasoned argument is at the basis of Jaina
belief. Not only right belief is necessary, but it must be based on right
reasoning. One of the most important characteristics of Jainism is its many
points of view (Anekanta) All things can be looked at from different points of
view. Different standpoints yield different results, which sometimes seem to
contradict each other. The value and the necessity of the many-sided doctrine
are thus evident. In all the five examples given above, there is apparent some
sort of religious belief, self-denial, an admirable determination and devotion,
but on a deeper consideration all the five turn out to be merely varieties of
error of one kind or another. Thus, Buddhism believes that every thing is
transient ; this is perfectly true so far as the ever-present modifications of
substances are concerned. but these modifications must depend upon something in
which they are going on. That some thing remains one throughout its modi.
fications. Truth tells us that every substance is characterised by a number of
attributes and modifications. Its modifications are always changing, but its
attributes, which make it the particular individual substance, last throughout
all these changes. The substance is called Dravya, its attributes Guna, its
modifications Paryava. The coming in of the view modification is Utpada ; the
going out of the old one is Vyaya ; and the lasting sameness which always
remains in the thing which is modified is called Dhrauvya. Buddhism also fixes
its mind upon modifications. But it ignores the permanence of the substance upon
which the modifications depend. This is what is meant by saying that Budhism is
only a one-sided and e a kind of wrong belief. The Vedas are the most ancient
and most authoritative revealed sacred books of the Hindus. Also they are
characterised by the great importance of Yajna, sacrifice of many kinds. Goats,
sheep, horses, cows, even human beings, were brought to the sacrificial altar to
gain merit and reward in this world and in the next. The great perversity and
ignorance of this kind of belief is obvious. The first thing to realise is that
there is a common or similar current of life in all living beings, and that any
injury to the vitality of the lowest animal is as hurtful and painful to it as
to the highest human

 14 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. being. Then it would be conceded that it is
the duty of every thinking spiritual being not to hurt anything that lives, and
that it is the greatest sin to neglect this first precept of Life. How can then
killing animals for sacrifice bring any good here or hereafter to the killer or
the killed or indeed to any body else? No example could be a more patent
illustration of perverse belief. Much less justifiable and much more sinful and
censurable, then, is the killing of animals for food or sport. Belief that such
taking of life is right or excusable is certainly a perverse belief. The
enormity and sinfulness of modern Wars is obvious. True veneration is always the
due of real and universal truth, and of those who have realised it themselves,
and are willing and capable of helping others to realise it. When this
veneration is paid to a lesser doctrine or person, it is a sign that the belief
which inspires it, is not right. When ignorant or superstitious people worship
the goddess Mata, Sitla, to remove their small-pox or to give them children; or
even educated or scientific people claim provisional or incomplete truth to be
whole and eternal truth, and venerate it as such their veneration cannot be
called right-belief, because it is directed towards a partially or wholly wrong
matter. When a man is not sure about the ultimate right or wrong of his belief,
he is said to have wrong belief due to doubt. For example, like the saint Indra,
who was in doubt whether a woman could or could not attain liberation. People,
who mortify the flesh to save the soul, venerate and follow the wrong. The flesh
must be subordinated to the soul, but blind hurting of the flesh is not the true
path to the liberation of the soul. Right belief is belief in things as they
really exist. It in volves a true knowledge of these things. Any
indiscrimination or absence of knowledge, to whatever cause it may be due,
prevents the belief from being complete and right. Then the Ajnana kind of wrong
belief is said to arise. micchaMtaM vedaMto jIvo vivarIyadaMsaNo hodi| Na ya

Commentary. Subsidential right-belief is of 2 kinds (1) Prathamaupashama
Samyaktva-the first subsidential-right-belief. It may arise (1) in a soul which
has never had right-belief, by the subsidence of the four Error-feeding passions
(4 Anantanubandhi Kashayas) and wrong-belief Mithyatva; or (2) in a soul which
has had (but has lost) right-belief, by the subsidence of the above 5, and of
the 2, mixed-right-and-wrong belief (Samiaktva Mithyatva) and right-belief-
clouded-by-slight-wrong-belief (Samyaktva Prakriti Mithyatva) Karmas. (2)
Dvitiyopashama Samyaktva, the second subsidential rightbelief. It arises in a
saint in the 7th spiritual stage of perfect vows, when the saint is preparing to
pass on to the 8th stage of New-thought-activity along the ladder of
subsidential advancement, having been already a right believer of the
destructionsubsidential kind. He transforms the nature of the four error-feeding
passions, into lesser passions, and causes the subsidence of the 3 sub-classes
of right-belief-deluding Karmas, namely, Mithyatva, Samyaktva Mithyatva, and
Samyaktva Prakriti Mithyatva. The right-belief of this saint is called the
second subsidential rightbelief. The matter of wrong belief Karma by being
subjected to the thought-activity of the first subsidential right-belief is
changed into the above 3 kinds. Wrong belief has the largest number of
molecules. Mixed-right-and-wrong belief has a number of molecules innumerably
less than it. And right-belief-clouded-by-slightwrong-belief innumerably less
than those of mixed-right-andwrong-belief. In (Gatha) 11, the thought-activity
in this stage is said to be the natural (Parinaamika) thought-activity of the
soul; this is so because the right belief which the soul had acquired in the 4th
stage has left it, and it has not yet fallen back into the stage of wrong belief
(Mithyatva). The minimum duration of the fall is one instant of time, and the
maximum is 6 winks (Avali). During this downfall the soul has neither right
belief nor wrong belief, therefore it is said to have its natural (Parinamika)
thought-activity; because right-belief-deluding Karma (Mithyatva) has not yet
begun to operate, but will do so after 6 winks at the most, i. e., when the

Note, however, that the downfall itself is due to the operation of the error-
feeding passion. From this point of view in the downfall (Sasadana) stage the
soul is said to have operative thought-activity (Audayika Bhava).

kind of the right-belief-deluding Karma, Darshana Moha), which is a slightly
different kind of all-destructive Karmic matter (Sarvaghati Prakriti), (there)
is neither (entirely) right belief, nor (entirely) wrong belief, (but) the
thought activity is mixed (i. e., a mixture of right and wrong belief). (This is
the description of 3rd or mixed spiritual stage (Mishra Gunasthana). *
Commentary. Jatyantara Sarvaghati.- There are 4 destructive (Ghatiya) Karmas ;
Deluding (Mohaniya) Karma is one of them. It is of two kinds : right-belief-
deluding (Darshana Mohaniya) and right-conduct-deluding (charitra-mohaniya).
Right-belief-deluding Karma is of three kinds : (1) Wrong belief (mithyatva).
(2) Mixed-right-and-wrong belief (Mashra or Samyaktva | Mithyatva). (3) Right-
belief-slightly-clouded-by-wrong-belief (Samyaktva Prakriti Mithyatva). All
these three classes are of "destructive" Karmic matter; but there is a
difference in their degrees. Mithyatva is all distructive (sarvaghati) of right
belief. Mishra is slightly different from Mithyatva, because it does not effect
a total destruction of right belief, as in it there is always present some right
belief mixed with wrong belief.

 GOMMATASARA. nor does the death-bed overflow (maranantika samudghata take
place) in the mixed (Mishra stage). Commentary. 19 One thing must always be
remembered with regard to this and the preceding stage. They are both more or
less transitory. The utility and necessity of the downfall (sasadana) stage is
simply to mark or explain the thought-activity of the soul during the very short
time which it takes in its downfall from right belief in the 4th to wrong belief
in the 1st stage. The thought-activity in the mixed stage also is of very short
duration, one (Antar-Muhurta), the minimum being a wink (Avali) and an instant,
and the maximum being 48 minutes minus one instant. In the thoughtactivity in
this stage the soul is both a wrong and right believer. The preservation of
wrong belief makes it impossible that he should practise any vows. The vows are
reserved for the 5th stage and onwards. They are a part of right conduct; and
right conduct must always be preceded and accompanied by right knowledge and
right belief. Another noticeable thing is this. In the mixed stage, as also in
the thought-activity due to subsidential-right-belief, there is no bondage of
the matter of age-karma. The bondage of the age-karma, as also the death before
reincarnation (the agekarma for an incarnation is bound to the soul in the
immediately preceding birth, so that a man is born with an age-karma already
binding his soul) must take place from the first or the fourth spiritual stage.
According to Shri Nemi-Chandra-Acharya, the death must be from that very stage
in which the age-karma is bound. But the commentary of Shri-Abhaya-Chandra page
49, (Gommatsara Jiva-Kanda, Calcutta Press) mentions another opinion that the
death must be from the 1st or the 4th stage, but not necessarily from the one in
which the age-karma was bound. In this stage there is no death-bed overflow of
the soul; this is necessary, because there is no death in this stage. It would
be seen that there can be no bondage of age-karma in this stage, because at a
man's death-bed, the same thoughtactivity must prevail by which the age-karma of
its next incarnation was bound. And as there can be no death in this, there can
be no bondage of age-karma in this stage. Now why should a man not die in this
stage? Perhaps it is that the vitalities, which keep up the inevitable struggle
between right and wrong belief, grow extremely weak

======================
 GOMMATASARA. 1. Subsidential-right-belief (Upashama Samyaktva).-It is of two
kinds, (i) first (Prathama) (ii) second (dvitiya). (See under Gathas 19-20
above). The duration of this is at the most one Antar muhurta. From this the
soul falls down to the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd stage. This three-fold downfall has been
described above in the preceding Gathas. If there is no downfall, then after the
expiry of its duration, it changes into the second kind of right belief. 21 2.
Destructive-subsidential-right-belief (Kshayopashama-Sam yaktva) in which there
is the operation of right-belief-slightly clouded-by-wrong-belief, (Samyaktva-
Prakriti-Mithyatva) the last of the 3 sub-classes of right-belief-deluding
Karma, (Darshana Moha), and the other 2 sub-classes along with the 4 error-
feeding passions are partially destroyed and partially in subsidence. The
minimum duration of this destructive-subsidential right-belief is one
AntarMuhurta; and the maximum is 66 Sagaras. This maximum is made up of 13
Sagaras in the 7th heaven, 22 in the 16th, and 31 Sagaras in the highest
(Graiveyaka). 3. Destructive-right-belief (Kshayika Samyaktva).-It arises by the
destruction of all the 3 sub-classes of right-belief-deludingkarma and the 4
error-feeding passions. This is the best and highest kind of right belief; once
gained, it lasts for ever. The soul that acquires it, must-attain liberation at
the latest in 33 Sagaras and 2 crore -Purvas, minus 8 years and one
AntarMuhurta. This maximum is possible for a human being who is born in Videha
Kshetra, (one of the seven divisions of Jambu Dweepa), and has the maximum age
of one crore Purva. From there he can, after completing his age, attain
Sarvartha Siddhi (the highest heaven) with an age of 33 Sagaras. He may
thereafter be born again in Videha Kshetra with the maximum age of one crore
Purva, after which he must attain liberation. As a human being can not attain
destructive-right-belief before reaching the age of 8 years, and as the period
for the attainment of destructive-right-belief is one antar-muhurta, we have to
deduct 8 years and one antar-muhurta from 33 Sagaras and 2 crore Purvas, to fix
the maximum duration of destructive-right-belief. This arises only at the feet
of the Omniscient Kevali or the allscripture-knowing Shruta Kevali saints. = The
destructive-right-belief is perfect. There is no matter to cloud or disturb it,
but in the destructive-subsidential-right belief

 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. there is the operation of that class of Karmic
matter which gives rise to right-belief-slightly-clouded-by-wrong-belief. This
slight clouding takes the form of the 3 defects -wavering (chala), defective or
impure (mala), and non-steadfast (agadha). By wavering; (chala) is meant that
condition of right-belief in which its substance remains quite sound, but only
the form is slightly disturbed, as the surface of the ocean is. disturbed by the
waves ; an example of it, which is generally, given is that of a man who
worships Shantinatha specially, rather than the other Tirthankaras for acquiring
peace or Shanti. By defective or impure (mala), is meant right-belief which has
got the five following defects : (1) Shanka Doubt, Scepticism. (2) Kanksha -
Desire of sense pleasures. (3) Jugupsa- Disgust with a sick or deformed person.
(4) Anyadrishti-Prashansa-Thinking admiringly of wrong believers. (5)
Anyadrishti Samstava-Praising wrong believers. By non-steadfast (Agadha) is
meant right-belief which is not quite fixed in the true nature of things ; for
example, worshipping in one's own temple in preference to the temple built by
others. It is something like a mirror attached to a pivot, to which it is not
firmly fixed. It will show a perfect image but not steady. For a man who has
steadfast right-belief knows that it makes not the slightest difference, whether
you worship in your temple or in one built by your neighbour. These 3 defects do
not occur in subsidential-right-belief also. In this and in the destructive-
right-belief, the vision is clear, and there is no room for doubt or defects.
None of these 7 Karmas is operative to cloud the clearness of the vision. It is
only in the destructive-subsidential-right-belief that the Samyaktva Prakriti
Mithyatva is operative, and therefore these defects arise.* sammAiTTI jIvo

provocation. Control (Samyama), or vow (vrata) relates to the senses or the
vitalities. It is respectively called sense-control (Indriya Samyama) and
vitality-control (Prana-Samyama). In sense-control one's own senses are
restrained, and in vitality-control one restrains oneself from doing any injury
to the ten vitalities of himself or others. The man in this stage of vowless
right-belief takes no vows for any of these two kinds of control. paccakkhA

sub-division of the right-conduct-deluding Karma) the thought-activity which
produces (perfect) control (Samyama) does not arise, but (there is) some
control. Therefore the 5th (stage) is (called) the partial-vow (Deshavrata)
stage. Commentary. This partial-vow stage (Deshavrata) (has the destructive-
subsidential thought-activity (Kshayopashama-Bhava), because in it there is
partial destruction and partial subsidence of the Karmic matter of the passions
which prevent total vow (Pratyakhyana-varana Kashaya) and there is the operation
(Udaya) of that kind of Karmic matter which forms such passions as prevent the
vows only partially. So that in this stage only partial vows can be observed.
that in the destruction-subsidence (Kshayopashama) of Karmas, the destruction of
part of the Karmic matter means that though the Karmic matter in the ordinary
course of things does rise on its maturity to bear fruit, yet instead of bearing
fruit, it simply passes along and leaves the soul, free. By subsidence
(Upashama) is meant the precipitation, or subsiding, of those Karmas which are
in actual bondage with the soul but which do not operate at th time. This
destruction is called non-operative destruction (Udayabhava-Lakshana-kshaya),
and the subsidence is called existencesubsidence (Sattarupa Upashama).

is accompanied by right-belief. A right believer may be a vowless man. But he
always carries compassion, etc., in his heart, therefore he never commits
unprovoked or unnecessary sin, even if he has not vowed against its commission;
so the soul in the fifth stage has not vowed not to hurt immobile souls, but
naturally he would not hurt even immobile souls unnecessarily.

Karmic matter of the passions. Still there is the intense operation (Tibra -

prevent the observance of the perfect vows.

indulgence, Arati - Ennui, Shoka-sorrow, Bhaya-fear, Jugupsa- disgust, Stri-

thought-activity has its corresponding thought-paint (Leshya). The pale mien of
habitually studious people, and the dark red of persons in rage has been noticed
in all countries and ages. A man with an unfixed conduct often changes his
thought-paint or leshya. Sri Nemi chandracharya has used a very appropriate
word, chequered or variegated to express this unfixity of conduct. This unfixity
is due to carelessness (Pramada) as described in the text. It must be noted that
all the most obvious and usual duties of saintship are discharged in this stage;
for example-teaching, and preaching the scriptures, and reading and writing the
books, looking after the discipline of pupils, travelling abroad, and taking
food. fazgi agi zarur jftufuer aga qus T | cadu cadu paNa megegaM hoMti pamAdA

 GOMMATASARA. Commentary. The 4 censurable talks or gossips ( Vikathas ), each
being com - bined with each one of the 4 passions, gives the number 4x4 - 16 of
combinations of 2 elements each. Each of these 16 being combined with each one
of the 5 senses make 16x5 = 80 combinations of 3 elements each. Each one of
these 80 must have sleep and attach - ment, so that the number of the
combinations of 5 elements each is 80. paDhamaM pamapamA kameNa zikkhiviya

succeeding classes. Nikkhittu bidiyamettaM paDhamaM tassuvari bidiya makkekaM  /

get the 80 combinations). Commentary. This distribution is as follows: Place the
4 kinds of gossips one by one as there are 4 passions, each of the 4 gossips
will have to be placed in 4 places. Each one of the 4 passions can cover the
gossips in turn, thus we get 16 combinations of two elements each. All these 16
combina - tions will have to be placed 5 times so that each one of them should
be covered with each one of the 5 senses, thus yielding 80 com - binations of 3
elements each. To each one of the 80 add sleep and

 32 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. greed passion, sense of touch, sleep and
attachment. (V. K. I i.e. the third Vikatha, gossip; the fourth Kashaya,
passion; and the first Indriya, sense). A concrete example of it may be
something like this : A man takes part in seditious talk and is prepared to
commit sedition for money so that he may go and live with his wife in his
village. Here the elements of seditious gossip, greed, and the object of touch
are obvious. Sleep and attachment are the two elements common to all
combinations of Pramada. They merely indicate that the soul who is affected by
carelessness (Pramada) is a mundane soul. Sleep and attachment to some extent or
other, are always present in all careless mundane souls, i. e., in all souls who
are not in the seventh or higher spiritual stages. This example applies to the
combinations under gathas 38 and 40. Under gathas 37 and 39 the process is
exactly the reverse of it. We begin the senses and finish with the gossips.

by the number of the elements of the last class, substract from it the number of
elements which follow in their class the element given. Do the same at all
steps. Commentary. For example to find the number of combination, being given
the elements seditious gossip, greed, and touch etc., i. e., 3rd gossip, 4th
passion and 1st sense. Take 1, multiply it by 5 senses=5, substract from it 4
(i. e., the No. of senses which follow touch in their class) this gives 1.
Multiply the remainder by 4 passions-4, substract from it nothing as no element
follows greed in the passion class -4. Multiply 4 by 4 gossips-16; substract 1
as 1 gossip follows seditious gossip in the gossip class, the result is 15. Thus
15th is the number of this combination.

Commentary. This is called ordinary (Svasthana or Niratishaya), because the soul
cannot rise higher from this stage; it lasts only one Antarmuhurta; and from it
the soul falls down to the 6th, and re-ascends to the 7th stage, again and

Commentary. The soul which attains the extraordinary stage of perfect vow faces,
and is fit to go up either the subsidential or the destructive ladder. If he is
a right believer of the subsidential-destructive kind (kshayopashama samyaktva),
he will first transform the Karmic matter of the 4 error feeding passions into
the remaining 21 passions; then after one antarmuhurta, by the subsidence of the

of the thought-activity in which the purity of the soul increases infinite fold
at every instant (Samaya). (Adhah) means lower in level. This activity is called
Adhah Karanal because by it the soul on a lower level can quickly rise to the

the Thoughts) of advanced thought-activity (Anivritti Karana). In these, only
one thought-activity arises in each instant. (These thoughts), by the flames of
the fire of very pure concentration are the consumers of the forest of Karmas.
Commentary. The number of thoughts in this stage is equal to the number of
instants 'Samayas' in its duration. The advance in purity and generally, in this
stage is perfectly uniform. Later souls can neither exceed nor come to the level
of the prior souls.

Sparddhaka (fruition-group) is a group of molecules of Karmic matter which have
the present or future capacity of fruition. Purva Sparddhakas means Sparddhakas

those molecules, the fruition of which has been enfeebled by the ti activity in
this stage. Badara Krishti is fruition-group of even a weaker degree; and
Sukshma Krishti is weaker than Badara Krishti. The Mathematics of the series

times in one instant (Samaya), the soul can have only one thought, pure or
mixed. In (Adhah Karana,) a soul who enters this stage can acquire the same
degree of thought-activity as that of the souls who have preceded it. The
thought-activity overlaps and therefore it is called (Anukrishti). In the
Apurva-Karana, the soul who enters later can never reach the thought activity
acquired by the souls who entered before. But if several souls enter at the same
instant, their progress onwards may be equal or unequal. Some of them may attain
purer thought-activity than the others ; but none of them can ever be overtaken
by any soul who enters afterwards. In (Anivritti Karana,) even those souls who
enter at the same instant advance uniformly. In this stage, the soul brings
about either the subsidence or destruction of all the 21 sub-classes of
passions, right-conduct-deluding karma (Charitra Moha), except the 4 error-
feeding passions, which were already transformed into these 21. But the soul has
the very slightest form of greed which is the characteristic, which it has in
the 10th stage. All but-passion less (Sukshma Samparaya.).

season in India. They are practically the first half of winter (a season of 4
months). In the cold season all the muddy turbulence of the rains goes to the
bottom, and leaves the upper water of ponds, tanks, etc., clear and transparent.
Note-that this stage is reached only by a soul who is ascending the subsidential
ladder (Upashama Shreni). This is the last rung of the subsidential ladder. It
is never touched by a soul who is fit to go up the destructive ladder (Kshapaka
Shreni). The duration of the stage is one Antar-Muhurta, and the soul cannot
progress onwards from this stage. The subsided karmic matter of the passions
rises again, and the soul must fall down from this stage. lissesakhINamoho

delusionless (Kshina Kashaya). Commentary. The soul ascending the destructive
ladder (Kshapaka Shreni) comes up to this stage direct from the 10th, without
touching the 11th stage. In the Antar-Muhurta which is its duration, the
thought-activity purifies the body very much, transforming the physical body
into a highly refined (Parmaudarika), and at the close of this stage the soul's
thought-activity destroys the three remaining destructive karmas (Ghatiya
karmas) i. e., knowledge. obscuring, conation -obscuring, and obstructive karmas
(Jnanavarniya, Darshana varniya and Antaraya) and thus reaches the next stage,

the whole Truth and preaches it, but he adds nothing to it. The truth is perfect

naturally there has been neither addition nor alteration in any of its contents

the Gatha is the antematurity shedding, due to the thought-activity of a right-
believer. As right belief goes on being re-inforced by ever-increasing rectitude
and purity of right conduct, the rate of shedding goes on increasing so that at
each succeeding stage it increases innumerable fold. It

 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. is easy to understand this by a rough example.
A huge forest is set on fire. The setting of the fire begins the consuming of
the forest, but if steadily increasing streams of oil are added to the fire from
all sides, the rate of consumption would increase at an incredible rate in a
very short-time and the huge forest would gradually be a heap of ashes. The
forest of karmas begins to be consumed by the fire of right belief. But the
consumption is swift and most concentrated when the thought-activity of right
conduct is taking the soul from stage to stage till it reaches Nirvana and is
absorbed for ever in its own thought-activity. The shedding relates to all the
karmas except the age-karma (ayu). This innumerable fold intensity of the
shedding appears at the time of rising from one stage into another.

qualities which make up a common name, as for example animality, possession of
five senses, rationality and humanity in man, because this common conotation
applies to all the individuals who are found in space and are called man, it is
called common conotation in space, or spatial conotation (Tiryak Samanya or
Sadrishya Samanya). But in any particular man, all these common attributes of
man have existed in all his different conditions since he was born as a human
being. A consideration of the common conotation as existing for all this time is
called common conotation in time or time conotation (Urdhvata Samnaya or
Tadbhava Samanya). The genus (Jati) of mundane souls is of 5 kinds according to
their possession of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 senses. All these souls may be mobile or
immobile. All the one sense souled are immobile, the rest are mobile. (2) They
may be gross or fine; all the souls are gross, only some of the one-sensed souls
are fine. (3) All the souls are either developable or not. (4) All the souls
occupy one body each, except some vegetable souls who share their body with
other souls. One and not more than one of these four pairs of distinction must
be found in a soul at any time. But the 4 must be compatible;

gross-bodied. (Vadara). See gatha 183-184. (Sanjni and Asanjni) - The division

again fall back into the condition of Nigoda. These are called "Chaturgati-

(Non-host-individual-souled.) The first also supports various host-souls, while
the second does not, and is purely individual-souled. Generally the same
vegetables which are host-individualsouled (Sapratishthia) in the beginning,
become non-host-individualsouled (Aptratishthia) when nerves and their other
distinctive features have appeared on the out-side also. Let us take an apple
for example. So long as the nerves and the outer contours do not all appear, it
is regarded as Sapratishtita; but when they have appeared, the host souls
thriving on it, cease to exist any longer and it becomes purely individual. But
there are certain vegetables that continue to be hostindividual-souled
throughout. Root vegetables may be regarded as belonging to this class. The two
kinds of Non-developable souls are: (1). Nirvrittya-paryapta (Pontentially
developable) and Labdhyaparyapta (Absolutely Non-developable). (2). The first
are those that are in the condition of Non-developableness for an antar-muhurta
but shall become developable afterwards, while the second are those that shall
die within an antar-muhurta without becoming so developable. Their age-duration
is th part of the time of one pulse beat of a healthy person. Trasa Pancha.-
Five mobiles. These are the two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, irrational

 60 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. This gatha gives us the Five hundred and
seventy soul classes as shown in the table. For illustration, let us take the
10th variety. If we simply multiply it by one, irrespective of the distinction
of developable, and non-developable, we get ten soul classes. If we distinguish
them as developable and non-developable we shall have twenty soul classes. Again
if we distinguish them as developable, potentially developable, and absolutely
non-developable, we get thirty soul classes. Thus we have at the maximum thirty
soul classes in the tenth variety, at the minimum ten classes, and at the medium
twenty classes. Similarly, if we add all the classes in all the varieties from
one to nineteen, we get at the minimum total 190, at the medium 380, and at the
maximum 570 soul classes. The division of souls into 570 classes, it should be
noted, is meant only for clear exposition and grasp of the different varieties
of souls. Strict. ly and logically, there are only ninety-eight (98) soul
classes, as shown in the following two gathas.

liberation and the guides on the path to it. Their number is twenty-four in each
cycle of time in each of the Bharat, and Airavata-kshetras. Chakravartinsare the
monarchs of all the six parts of Bharat kshetra or Airavata kshetra. They are

khanda and 5 Mlechha-khanda. Sakala Chakvartins rule over all the six parts of a
Kshetra. An Ardha-chakravarti, may be either a Narayana or his opponent
Pratinarayana. The elder brother of a Narayana is called Baldeva or Balabhadra.
In each cycle of time, there are nine Narayanas, nine Pratinarayanas and nine
Balabhadras. In each of the two Kshetras there are 24 Tirthamkaras, 12
Chakvartins, 9 Narayanas, 9 Prati-Narayanas, and 9 Balbhadras the 63 Great men

must have the following characteristics. Its matter, must be either living or
non-living, or a combination of living or non-living; it must be either hot, or
cold or a combination of hot and cold ; it must be either covered, or

(but) in detail, there are by rule eighty-four Lakhs of Nuclei. Commentary. Note
that all souls with 1, 2, 3, or 4 senses are necessarily born by spontaneous
generation. Only the 5 sensed souls are born in all the 3 possible ways by
spontaneous generacion, uterine birth, and instantaneous rise. Note also that
celestial and hellish beings are 5 sensed and born by instantaneous rise. Both
are born in a covered nucleus, the celestial being born in a sort of box-bed and
the hellish beings in a sort of bladder hung from the ceilings of their holes in
hell. Note also that all the egg-born souls must be five sensed although they
may be with or without mind. The pigeon or dove is a five sensed being with
mind. The nuclei for the hellish beings

the Svayambhuramana ocean) is twelve (Yojans long), the red Scorpion, a three-
sensed soul of the Sva. yambhuramana continent is (one krosa less one (Yojana
long; the Black Bee, a four sensed soul of the above continent is) one (Yojana
Long) (and amongst the five sensed souls) the Great Fish (Maha Matsya of the
same ocean) (is) one thousand Yojanas (long). Commentary. Space (Akasha) is
divided into the universe (Loka-kasha) and non-universe (aloka-kasha). The
unverse is divided into three parts. The upper universe, (Urdhva Loka), the
middle universe (Maddhya Loka,) and the lower world (Adhah-Loka). The upper
universe and that alone contains the heavenly order (kalpavasi) of celestial
beings. In the centre of the middle universe there is Mount Meru. It is
surrounded on all sides by Jambu Dvipa, a continent hay diameter of 1.00.000
large yojans. Jambu Dvipa is encircled by the ocean. Lavanodadhi, 2,00,000 large
yojans in diameter ; this is encircled by the continent Dhatuki khanda 4,00,000
large yojans in diameter; encircled by the occan Kalo Dadhi 8,00,000 large
yojans in diameter; this is encircled by the continent Pushkaravara-dvipa
16,00,000 large yojans in diamater. Puskaravara dvipa is bisected throughout by
the mountain Manu-shottara, so called because no human beings can exist beyond
this mountain. Beyond Pushkaravara dvipa there are innumerable oceans and
continents, the diameter of each one being double of that of its predecessor.
The last continent is Svayamb-huramana and the last ocean is also called
Svayambhu ramana. The last continent is divided in its middle by the mountain
Svayamprabha. The first 2 continents and the first 2 oceans have both Karma and
Bhoga Bhumis. The last ocean and half of the last continent next to the ocean
have got pnly Karma Bhumi. The rest of the oceans ard continents have only Bhoga
Bhumi. The middle universe is the abode of 3 orders of celestial beings i.e.,
the residentials (Bhavanavasi). pripetatics (Vyantara) and Stellars (Jyotisha)
orders, as also of the human and sub-human beings. Human and sub-humanbeings
both of Karma and Bhoga Bhumi are found in the first two oceans and the first 2)
continents. i.e. up to the Manushottara. No human beings of any kind are found
anywhere else in the universe. One sensed beings are found in the whole
universe. 2 to 4 sensed and 5 sensed irrational beings are found

continents, last continent and the last ocean. Five sensed rational human beings
are found only in the first 2! continents and the first 2 oceans. Five-sensed
rational subhuman beings of the Bhoga-Bhumi type are found everywhere except the
last half continent and the last ocean. Beyond Manushottara up to the
Syayamprabha there are only 5 sensed animals with mind, only of the Bhoga Bhumi
type. In the last continent and the last ocean there are all kinds of sub-human
animals of the Karma Bhumi type. The enormous, almost unimaginable, extent of
the last of the innumerable continents and oceans is evident from the fact that
Jambudvipa the first of them is one lac yojans in diameter. Each yojan being of
the larger kind which is 500 times of the smaller yojan which is equal to 4
koses or 8 miles. Thus the diamete of Jambudvipa is 40,00,00,000 miles. This
figure is doubled in a geometric-progression and it is impossible for the
ordinary human mind to conceive it when we consider the dimensions of the last
ocean. The lotus in the last ocean has a stalk 1000 yojans long and 1 yojan in
diameter. Its whole volume is about 750 cubic yojans. And the great fish there,
is 1000 yojans long, 500 broad and 250 yojans thick. These huge dimensions of
living beings are quite in keeping with the dimensions of Swayambhu ramana
samudra, the last and biggest of all the oceans in the universe. and they are
quite possible and reasonable. These matters like all others, are quite plain to
the Omniscient, who is the ultimate source of our knowledge about them. Here one
Yojana is equal to four Krosas, or 8 miles. This is the ordinary short Yojana
which is used for measuring bodies. The great Yojana which is five-hundred times
greater is used in showing the measures of continents and oceans etc. viticapa

Commentary. For example, let us suppose that the size of Anundhari is 1000 cubic
finger and suppose the multiplicant is 2, then the size of Kunthu would be, that
of Kana Makshika 3-2 and that of Sikthaka matsya would be cubic finger. It will
be seen that the minimum bodily size of any developable mobile soul is only some
part of cubic finger. The method of finding out the different variations in

vriddhi) is reached by adding one 'spatial unit' (pradesh) to the minimum size.
Further than this there is consistently an increase of one spatial unit (in
every subsequent size.) Commentary. The minimum bodily size has innumerable
spatial units. From this it grows by four kinds of increase till the size in the
second place (i. e. that of fine non-developable air-bodied souls) is arrived
at. The increase is of six kinds namely. 1. Infinite-part increase (ananta-bhaga
vriddhi). 2. Innumerable part-increase (asamkhyata bhaga vriddhi). 3. Numerable-
part-increase (samkhyata bhaga vriddhi). 4. Numerable fold increase (samkhyata
guna vriddhi.) 5. Innumerable fold increase (asamkhyata guna vriddhi. 6.
Infinite-fold-increase (ananta-guna vriddhi). Besides these six, there is also a
seventh increase called indescribeable (avaktavya). It operates between the end
of one increase and the beginning of another. Out of these six kinds of
increases the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th increases only apply in the increase of
size. The first and the last, infinite part and infinitefold increases are out
of question since the spatial units of all sizes from the minimum to the maximum
are not infinite but innumerable only. The process of the four increases is
shown in the following gathas. avaroggAhaNamANe jhnnnnprimidasNkhraasihide|

all bodied souls are one Koda-Kodi (one hundred million, 10 m. x 10 m.), ninety-
seven lacs, and fifty thousand crores. Commentary. Physique (Kula) is natural
constitution. Its characteristics are dependant upon the kind of material
molecules of which the physical (audurika) and fluid (vaikriyika) bodies are
made. The distinction of physique is due to the operation of the high and low
subclasses of the family-determining Karma (Gotra Karma)-This Karma is ever
operative along with the body-making, the age-determining, and the feeling Karma
(Nama, Ayu, and Vedaniya). This simultaneous co-operation is obvious. The age
Karma is a sort of winding up of the whole machinery. Its existence means the
existence of the age vitality. It being exhausted, the whole machinery of a
particular mundane condition of existence comes to stop. The body making Karma
determines the condition of existence, the genus of beings, their bodies, limbs,
formation, molecular bondage, interfusion, figure, osseous structure of the body
and their various functions, capacities, and effects at-rest and in-motion. The
family-determining Karma (Gotra) determines the high or low class of family in
which the soul takes birth. The principle of heredity seems to be recognised by
Jainism here. In developing its body and senses the soul chooses and assimilates
the kinds of material molecules which are in consonance with the character of
the family determined for its birth by the family-determining Karma (gotra). The
different sorts of constitution of the material molecules of which the physical
and fluid bodies are formed are the different physiques mentioned here. A rough
obvious observation may be made in this connection by seeing that the
constitution of the material body of dog, deer, goat, sheep, lion, man,
different kinds of women, plants,

(the molecules of Ahara Vargana of which the external bodies are formed,
capacities of forming) body and sense, (the capacity of) (breathing, the
capacity of) speech and mind are the six developable capacities (paryapti). (Out
of them) four, five and six belong (in their regular order) to one sensed,
incomplete sensed (i.e. two, three, four and irrational five sensed) and
rational (five sensed souls). Commentary. The soul immediately after its
vigrahagati i.e. passage from one incarnation to another, assimilates to itself
the molecules of Ahara vargana out, ofwhich are formed its body, the senses, and
breathing, of bhasa-vargana i.e. sound molecules, out of which speech is formed,
and of mano-vargana or mind molecules out of which the mind organ in the shape
of an eight petalled lotus within the heart is formed. The gaining of the
capacity by the soul to develope the different kinds of molecules into their
resultant bodily characterstics is called Paryapti or developableness. As shown
above there are in all six Paryaptis out of which one-sensed souls can gain,
only the first four; and the two-sensed, three-sensed, foursensed, and
irrational five-sensed can gain only the first five; and only a rational five-
sensed soul can gain all the six. The difference between the first and the
second Paryapti i.e. Ahara and Sharira is that while the first helps in
transforming the Ahara vargana molecules into liquid and solid forms, the second
effects the formation of the trunk, flesh, blood and bones etc. Vikalendriya,
incomplete sensed, here include irrational fivesensed sculs. pajjattIpaTTavaNaM

 GOMMATASARA. 120. The gaining of the capacities starts simultaneously, but the
completion (of each of them), is effected gradually within the period of one
antar.muhurta, which increases in the case of each succeeding one. (Yet their
total period does not exceed one antar-muhurta), Commentary. Whatever time is
taken in the completion of the first development (assimilation, Ahara), a
numerable (Sankhyata) part of it being added to it gives the time taken by the
next (body Sharira) development. A numerable (Sankhyata) part of the time taken
by body developement being added to it gives the time taken by the senses
(Indriya) development. A numerable part of the time taken in sense-development
being added to it gives the time for the next respiration development, and so on
till the 6th. It must be noted that the most complete development of all the
capacities never takes more than one antar-muhurta This is so because there are
many kinds of an Antar-muhurta, the minimum being an avali and 1 Samaya and the
maximum, 48 minutes minus 1 Samaya. Let Sankhyata be, S. The value of S may be
different in the 6 developments. Let antar-muhurta be A. At the first intstant
of birth, the operation of the development of body-making-Karmas begins in a
developable soul. It begins to develope all the 6 or less developments
simultaneously. Assimilation development takes time A to be completed. The body
development takes A( 1+1) Senses Respiration , ,, ... A( 1+ 5). Al 1 + 1 4

the total will be something else. Now suppose S to be the minimum sankhayata
i.e. 2: and A to be the minimum antar-muhurta i.e. one avali + 1 instant,

The total time of the first two developments is equal to A + A( 1+1= A(2+ 1)-

the first instant of this time is that of birth vibratory division (upapada yoga

division (Ekantanuvriddhi yoga sthana). In other words there is the initiatory
and minimum vibratory activity in the 1st instant; there is increasing activity
for Avalis + half instant ; i.e. from the second up to the last but one instant
; and in and from the last instant onwards there is the Changing Vibratory
division (Parinama yoga sthana). This lasts up to the last instant of one's

 GOMMATASARA. Commentary. The antar-muhurta for the life of an absolutely non-
developable soul is always equal to one-eighteen of a pulsation. It should be
noted that there are 3773 pulsations in one muhurtai. e., 48 minutes in the case
of a healthy man. tiriNasayA chattIsA chAvadvisahasgANi maraNANi  /

Commentary. Here the antar-muhurta is equal to 3685 3 pulsations. Now there
being eighteen births and deaths within one pulsation, there will be 66336

Commentary. This gatha gives us the maximum number of births and deaths which a
soul possessed of different senses can consecutively undergo within one antar-
muhurta. It means that the same soul cannot be born more than the prescribed
number of times in the same class continuously in one antar-muhurta, although
the duration of each life will not be more than one eighteenth of pulsation. Of
the twenty-four births of a five-sensed being, there can be eighty human births,
eight irrational five-sensed sub-human, and eight rational five-sensed sub-human
births.

bodily vibrations, with a developable-body, and subject to the operation of
developable (body making-karma) is called incomplete vibratory soul (apurna-
yoga) when where is incompleteness (of development). Commentary. When in the
case of a vibratory omniscient soul the duration of age Karma is less than that
of each of the other three AghatiyaKarmas, there is an over-flow of the spatial
units of the soul, in order to equalize the duration of all the four Aghatiya
Karmas. This over-flow occupies eight instants. In the first instant it is
elongated like a stick (danda), in the second it broadens out like a door-leaf
(Kapata), in the third it spreads out up to the 3 universe encircling (pratara)
atmospheres, and in the fourth it occupies the whole universe (Loka-purna).
There is an immediate withdrawal backward and the stages are retraced in the
same lir instants until the spatial units resume the original physical form when

(downfall Sasadana), the fourth, and the sixth stages (i. e., vowless right
belief Avirata Samyaktva and incomplete vow pramatta-virata). The developable
souls have these as also the rest of the thirteen stages). Commentary.
Developableness does not go beyond the thirteenth stage, as in the fourteenth
stage it is not possible owing to the absence of soul vibrations. The reason for
a potentially developable soul being in the first, second and fourth spiritual
stages is that during the course of transmigration (vigragati) the soul is
always in one of these stages and the same stage continues after assumption of a
body, till it becomes developable i. e., gains its Paryaptis. The reason for a
potentially developable soul being in the sixth stage is that the spiritual man-
like emanation (Aharaka sharira) is formed in this stage only; and during the
course of its formation the condition of the saint is that of potential
developableness. hemipuDhavaNaM joisivaNabhavaNa savvaitthINaM  /  puriNadareNa

to all females. There is no down-fall stage (Sasadana) in the nondevelopable
condition of hellish souls. Commentary. The spiritual stage (Gunasthana) present
during the transition period until rebirth, (Vigrahagati) continues in the
soul's nondevelopable condition for an antar-muhurta. One who retains Samyaktva
till death would not be born in the conditions detailed in the above gatha, and
it is not possible to acquire Samyaktva in the non-developable condition. Thus
there is no Samyaktva in the non-developable condition set out above. One who is

been laid down. Commentary. Vahya-prana (external vitalities) - The activities
of the five material senses, the body, speech, mind, respiration and age are
said to be the external vitalities (Vahya or Dravyaprana). While the activity of
inner consciousness or the internal motive force, which are due to the
destructive-subsidence of the knowledgeobscuring and power-obstructing Karmas
and to the operation of other Karmas and which are the stimulating cause of the
external activities are called internal vitalities (Abhyanatara or Bhava prana).
Paryapti is the attainment of the capacity of developing body, mind, speech, and
the five senses, while Prana is the activity of those functionaries.

comparative strength, to which injury is caused. The knowledge of the varying
number of vitalities possessed by souls in their various conditions of life
enables one to judge of the extent of injury he is likely to cause in his
actions. The following table would prove useful. Table showing the vitalities in

carelessness (pramada, which exists till the sixth spritual stage), there
remains no first animate feeling (i. e., desire for food), because of the
absense of the (internal) cause; the remaining (three animate feelings) owing to
the presence of their (causative) Karma, from a figurative point of view, still
exist though they are not effective. Commentary. Among the four causes of each
of the four feelings, the internal cause is all-supreme. The other causes are
effective only when there is the force of Karmas behind. Desire for food arises
from the premature operation (Udirana) of pain-feeling (Asata-Vedaniya) Karma.
Such operation is possible till the sixth Spiritual stage only. Therefore there
is no desire for food beyond the sixth Stage. Fearminor-passion Karma operates
only up to the Eighth, Sex-inclination minor-passion Karma up to the ninth, and
greed-passion-Karma up to the tenth Spiritual Stage. But from the seventh stage
onwards, their operation is so weak as not to disturb the meditative Saint in
any manner. Thus the last three animate-feelings do not really exist beyond
sixth Stage. They are said to exist only in a figurative way because the
causative Karmas have not till then subsided or been destroyed. CHAPTER VI.

human soul (Labdhyaparyaptaka Manushya), 7. Downfall belief (Sasadana samyaktva)
and 8. Mixed (Belief-mishra-Samyaktva). The maximum (interval for each of these,
respectively) is (1) Seven days, (2) Six months, (4) Seven years, (4) (Eight
years), (5) Twelve Muhurtas, and for (6) (7) and (8) the part of a Palya ; but
the minimum (time) is one instant (samaya, for each of these). Commentary. As a
rule souls exist in each of the various soul-quests at every instant (samaya).
The only exceptions to this general rule are enumerated, with their maximum and
minimum intervals, in the above two gathas. For example, there may sometimes, be
a total absence in the whole universe, of any soul in the Subsidential
Rightbelief i. e., in the twelfth soul quest. But this absence can last at the
maximum for seven days, or at the minimum for one instant, except in the case of
souls in the partial-vow, and imperfect-vow (fifth and sixth) spiritual stages,
when according to the following gatha, the interval may extend to fourteen, and
fifteen days, respectively.

(unamused, or Narakas, Hellish) are so called because they do never like the
objects, place, time and the conditions (in which they are placed), nor (do they
like) each other. Commentary. The derivative meaning of the word, naraka,
hellish soul is given here. All the objects, and surroundings in hell are
altogether disagreeable. The very name, "Narata' or (Naraka) signifies that the
hellish beings do not at all like the conditions of hell, nor do they like each
other.

leaders of men). Commentary. Manus or Kulakaras are born in the Bharata and
Airavata Kshetras just at the beginning of the transformation of Bhogabhumi or
enjoyment conditions into Karma-bhumi or work-condi. tions. They are sixteen in
number, and one follows the other, after definite intervals. They instruct the
people into the new ways of living, and hence they have been spoken of as the
chief ancestors of all men. In the present age, here, Nabhi Raja was the
fourteenth, his son Shri Rishabha-Deva, the first Tirthamkara, the fifteenth,
and his son Bharata Chakravarti, after whom the country is called Bharat-
Kshetra, was the last and the sixteenth. sAmaNNA paMciMdI pajjattA joNiNI

are so called because they always amuse themselves with their eight heavenly
acquisitions, and have shining heavenly constitutions. Commentary. The eight
heavenly acquisitions of the celestials, which are theirs by nature, are the
following: - 1. Anima-this enables them to make their body very small. 2. Mahima
- is the opposite of the first and helps them to extend their badies to any
dimensions. 3. Laghima-by which they can make their bodies very light. 4. Garima
by which they can make their bodies very heavy. 5. Sakama Rupitva- by which they
can at will adopt any forms, and any number of bodies at one time. 6. Vashitva -
by which they can bring others under subjection, 7. Ishitva by which they can
exhibit superiority. 8. Prakamya power to act as they desire. Heavenly
constitution. The constitution of celestial souls is technically called
'Vaikriyika, Sharira' Fluid-body. The celestial beings can assume any form they
like. The body has no flesh, blood, and bones, and there are no filthy
excretions from it. It is very lustrous. jAijarAmaraNabhayA

 GOMMATASARA. 101 152. The condition of Liberation (Siddha-Gati) is that in
which there are no birth, dotage, death or fear, (no) miseries arising from
(undesirable accompaniments, and from deprivation (of desirable objects), (no)
animatefeelings, and no diseases, etc. Commentary. The condition of liberated
souls is described here. Liberation Toplies freedom from Karmic matter, which
shrouds the real glory of the soul, drags it into various conditions, and makes
it experience multifarious pleasures and pains. But when all the Karmas are
destroyed the soul, which by nature has got an up-ward motion rises to the
highest point of the Universe-the Siddha-shila and there lives for endless time
in the enjoyment of its own glorious qualities unencumbered by the worldly
pleasures or pains. This is the ideal condition of a soul. sAmaNNA NeraiyA

fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh hells are in number equal to the quotient of
the spatial units of the (universal) line divided by its own twelyth, tenth,
eighth, sixth, third and second root (respectively). Commentary, This gatha
gives the method for calculating the number of hellish beings in total, and in
each hell. The method may be illustrated thus. Suppose one cubic finger
(ghanangula) to be 16 spatial units, and the universal line = 256 S. U. Then the
total number of all hellish souls would be 256 x 16 - 256 X 94 - 256 X 2-512.

line. Also in the case of other measures e.g. Jagat Pratara, Suchiangula,
Ghanangula, etc., the spatial units covered by each should be understood.

which obstructs and is obstructed by other objects. A body which neither

a fine body. A fine body can pass through any kind of matter. Gross bodies are
called destructible or obstructive because they alone can destroy each other.
Fine bodies are in destructible or non-obstuctive because nothing can kill them

condition of birth, (Upapada) death bed and (Omniscient over flow) all the other
mobiles do not exist out of the mobile channel. It has been said by the
Conquerors. GOMMATASARA. Commentary. An immobile soul out of the mobile channel,
transmigrating to be born as a mobile, is during the passage, beginning from the
first turn towards the mobile channel by operation of the mobile (body) making
Karma, a mobile out of the mobile channel. This is Uppada, condition prior to
birth. .  Samudghata is the emanation of soul spatial units from the body
without wholly discarding it. Seven kinds of these soul emanations are
recognised in Jain philosophy, (Dravya Sangraha S.B. J. Vol. I. p. 29, and
Commentary to Gatha 543). G Maranantika-Samudghata (Death-bed-emanation) is the
emanation, in some cases, of the soul spatial units shortly before death to the
place where it is next going to incarnate. These soul units after touching their
destination contract back to their former size and thereafter the soul leaves
the body. If any mobile soul in the mobile channel is to take its next birth as
an immobile outside the channel, and if before its death it performs the death-
bed emanation, it naturally goes outside the mobile channel being a mobile.
Kevala-Samudghata (Omniscient overflow) is the emanation, when in some cases the
soul of an omniscient being, (of course a mobile,) expands throughout the whole
universe, and then contracts back. This is also a case in which a mobile soul
goes outside the mobile channel. B Trasa Nadi (mobile channel) is the channel in
the middle of the universe. It is fourteen Rajus high, one Raju long and one
Raju broad. Mobiles are as a rule born within it alone. E 121 H The cylindar A B

of various sorts. Commentary, The size of the body of an earth, water, fire, and
air soul is the innumerable part of a cubic finger. Therefore they are not
visible as separate entities. We see them only in a mass. Take a glass of fresh
water. Every drop of it is a mass of water-bodied souls which are obviously
invisible to us. Under a microscope a drop of water is seen to possess many
minute animal-cule. These are not waterbodied souls. Water-bodied souls have
water and that alone as the matter of their bodies. These animal-culae are two
or more sensed beings which live in water.

 124 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. 1. Multiply 'Deyarashi' by itself as many
times as the Viralana and resulting number should again be multiplied by itself
as many times as its number is; such kind of multiplications should be done as
many times as the number of the Shalaka Rashi. The result will give us the 1st
step. 2. Take again Shalaka, Viralana, Deya, each equal to the num found in the
1st step. The multiplication process should be repeated as in the previous step
as many times as the number of the new Shalaka. This is the 2nd step. 3. The
resulting number should be again dealt with as in the previous case. This would
be the 3rd step. 4. This resulting number should again be similarly dealt with
as many times as there are numbers in the present fourth shalaka minus the total
number of the shalaka in the previous three steps. Here in the first step, the
number of innumerable spatial units of the universe should be taken to be
Viralana, Deya, shalaka. The above process will give us the number of fire-
bodied souls. For finding out the number of earth-bodied souls, the number of
fire-bodied souls should be divided by innumerable times the universal spatial
units, and the quotient added to the number of fire-bodied souls. For finding
out the number of water-bodied souls we should add to the number of earth bodied
souls, the quotient obtained by dividing the number of earth bodied by the
innumerable universal spatial units. In the same manner the number of air-bodied
souls should be ascertained. apadiTThidapatteyA asaMkhalogappamANayA hoti  /

 130 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. Commentary. The problem is like this: If 16
twos multiplied by each other become 65536, what will 64 twos become by being
multiplied by each other. Here there are two sets of three figures. The first
set is called the standard or 'Pramana Rashi.' In this all the three figures are
known. Thus, in the above problem "two" is the Deya Rashi or the given basis, 16
is the Viralana or index number and 65536 is the 'Phala' or result. The second
set of the desired or Ichchha Rashi also consists of the same three number of
which the 'Deya' is the same as in the standard or Pramana Rashi, and the
Viralana or index is given, but the third figure, that is, the Phala or result
is unknown and required to be obtained. Thus in the above problem, in the
desired Rashi the Deya is 2, index is 64 and the result unknown and to be
obtained. The formula, according to the gatha is as below: 216 Pannatthi 16 twos

spatial units of the universe raised to the power of the quotient obtained by
dividing the Halvings of the number of gross-bodied souls, by the Halvings of
the number of spatial units of the universe. Thus, the number of gross-fire-
bodied souls is equal to innumerable into innumerable spatial units of the

is popular truth. 2. A woman who is not the Prime queen may by general conserit

of Chandra-Prabha Tirthamkara represents Him, and is therefore called Chandra-
Prabha. This is representative truth. 4. A man may be named Jina-Datta though he
is not actually the gift of Jina as the name signifies. This is nominal truth.
5. This man is White.' The man has various hues in vario parts, eyes, hair,
etc., and is not at all white. Yet he may tri called white. This is an example
of figurative truth. 6. It is long. This is true comparatively and not
absolutely speaking. The thing is longer than one and shorter than another. This
is an example of relative truth. 7. A man may say that he is "cooking rice" even
when the rice is not being actually and is only ready for being cooked. This is
an example of practical truth. 8. 'Indra can over turn Jambu-dvipa.' Indra may
never do like this but he possesses the power to do it and it is a possibility
and hence possible truth. 9. Injunction against commissions of sins as laid down
in scriptures is scriptural truth. e. g., right belief, right knowledge, and
right conduct lead to Liberation.

occassions where language may be ambiguous or capable of abuse or

or what is neutral, neither true-nor-false, he exercise no special effort, and
the speech or thought is the result of the operation of developable, and
bodymaking Karmas. But when one speaks or thinks what is false, or both true and
false, it is intentional and is due to the operation of knowledge-obscuring
Karma. In all mind and speech vibrations the operation of developable and the

found in celestials. Hellish beings also have got a kind of fluid body which is
ugly and troublesome. It can also be transformed into many forms according to
their desire. Hellish souls cannot make many bodies out of one, as is done by
the celestials. vAdarateUvAUpaMciMdiya purANagA viguvvaMti  /  orAliyaM sarIraM

of both the omniscients (and saints) possessing full scriptural knowledge in his
places (where he can go); and also for holy celebrations, (Kalyana),
Renunciation and others happening in other regions (beyond his reach).
Commentary. By means of the Aharaka body the saint flashes through space and
obtains the sight or touches the feet of an Omniscient Lord or Saint with full
scriptural knowledge, and it is enough to strengthen his self control and to
remove his doubt. uttamaaMgamhi have dhAduvihINaM suhaM asaMhaNaNaM  /

Through this the saint having doubt in himself, going near an Omniscient (or a

242. The activities of fluid and assimilative bodies (are) not simultaneous in
(the saint in the stage of) imperfect vows, and also of necessity at one time
there is only one kind of vibration (out of the 15 kinds) in any mundane being
at any time. Commentary. The simultaneous manifestation of 2 kinds of yoga is
some-times possible. For example, when a man is repeating a prayer with his
tongue but his mind is thinking of something else, the thought is the
manifestation of the mind vibration, and the repetition of the prayer that of
the speech vibration. But this dual vibration is only seemingly so. At one
instant there can only be one kind of vibration. The explanation would be easy
to understand if we pause to try to comprehend the extremely short duration of
an instant (samaya). There are innumerable instants in a wink, and what figure
is meant by even the minimum innumerable, will be evident from the Appendix to
Jaina Gem Dictionary. Thus the possible change of the kind of vibration from
instant to instant is quicker than lightning. In one flash of lightning there
can be millions, trillions, quintillions, or even more changes of vibration from
mind to speech and from speech to mind. So, even to a most self-analytical and
self-absorbing man this transition from vibration to vibration would be almost
impossible to perceive. Then there is another thing to consider. The vibration
(yoga) is that power of the soul which at the operation of the body-making karma
becomes the cause of the inflow of karmic and non-karmic matter in the soul's
environments. This vibration once started can last for one maximum antara-
muhurta i. e. for 48 minutes minus one instant. Before this maximum or a smaller
duration of one kind of vibration has expired, another kind of vibration may set
in. This also gives rise to the phenomenon of an apparent duality of vibrations.
Thus the vibration may be only mind vibration, and the speech activity, i. e.
repeating the prayer may be due merely to the momentun (sanskara) of the
preceding speech vibration, just as a potter's wheel continues to revolve for
sometime even after he ceases to move it by his stick. jesiMga saMti jogA

bodies produced by the operation of the physical, fluid, assimilative and
electric (Taijasa) body sub-classes of the body-making karma, are no-karma or
quasi-karma, and the karmic (body produced by the operation of karmic body-sub-
class of body-making karma) is the karma proper (i. e, the interwoven texture of
the matter of the eight kinds of karmas.) Commentary. Whenever a body-karma
operates to set in activity the vibration power of the soul, material molecules
suitable to the then bodies of the soul are drawn in i. e. attracted to inflow
into the soul. The least number of bodies that a soul has is two, karmic and
electrio bodies, in transmigratory passage. So that at every instant the soul is
drawing in molecules both of karmic (karmana vargana ) and quasi-karmic matter
of the electric body (taijasa-vargana) in transmigratory passage. When not in
transmigratory passage the soul has in addition to the karmic and electric
bodies the physical or fluid body also which is made of assimilative molecules
(aharaka vargana). If the soul has more than one sense, it has speech also, and
takes in the vocal molecules (Bhasha vargana) also. As a five sensed rational
being, it assimilates mind molecules (mano-vargana) also. So that an ordinary
human being at every instant of time is drawing in these 5 varganas. paramANUhiM

Commentary. The infinite mentioned in this gatha is at its maximum, an infinite
part of the number of liberated souls, and at its minimum. infinite times the
number of souls incapable of liberation (abhavya), which is a kind of middle
infinite multiplied by infinite (madhyama Anant-anant,) Unit of bondage is the

(Taijasa and karmic bodies,) are infinite (times of that of the assimilative,

physical is the grossest body. The fluid body has innume. rable times the atoms

has innumerable times the atoms of and is finer than the fluid body. The
electric body has infinite times the atoms of, and is finer than, the

former kind we have an infinite number of the latter. Both the bodies are co-
extensive. Therefore the matter of the electric body must be very much finer
than that of the physical body. Perhaps it may be better understood by a
comparison of the wave-lengths of heat and electricity. The electric waves are
more numerous and shorter (that is, finer) than those of heat. So for the same
length in space, we have many more and much finer wave-lengths for electricity

then gunahani-ayama= 8. Here nana-gunahani the group of 6 gunahanis. Anyonya
bhyastarashi here=25-64. This minus one, being the divisor of the number of a
Unit of Bondage gives us the term of the series. E. G. if a Unit of Bondage have
6300 molecules, then the last term is 6300 64-1 -100. Thus the series of 6
gunahanis here is. 3200+ 1600+ 800+ 400+ 200+ 100-6300. 1600 800 400 200 100 In

They (the Acharyas) call (Passion) as Kashaya, (because) it ploughs (Krishati)
the field of soul's Karmas, extending to (eternal and infinite) length of
mundane existence, and productive of huge crop of pleasure and pain. Commentary.
Passion is the root of the continuance of our mundane existence. Tho whole
extent of mundane existence is the long long field which it ploughs. Its crops
are the innumerable pleasures and pains with which every mundane form of life is
always saturated. This great and incessant plougher is Passion, (Kashaya), so
called because it brings about the ploughing (Karshana) of the field of Karmas.
So they call it. This connotes two things, (1) that the account of the passions
here is based upon the earlier treatise Maha-Dhavala which in its second part
(Kashaya Prabhrita) deals with passions. The age of Maha-Dhavala which is the
last of the trilogy, Dhavala, Jai Dhavala and Maha-Dhavala, and of which only
one copy exists in Southern India in the library of the Parshvanath Temple at
Mudabidri, District South Canara, is very old indeed. This great commentary was
put together by the saintly disciples of Dharasenacharya who flourished about
600 or 700 years after Lord Mahayira. Thus he was a near successor to Umasvami,
author of the marvellous Tattvartha-sutra, and the most illustrious pupil of Sri
Kunda-kunda-charya who is daily mentioned in thousands of Jain temples as the
carrier onward of the unadulterated, authentic and authoritative tradition of
the Jain Doctrines of the great Gana. dharas, (apostles) who learnt the whole,
unchangeable, and eternal truth at the feet of the last Lord Mahavira Himself.
The saint Nemi-chandra is constantly anxious to advert to this unbroken
continuity of Jaina tradition. The second connotation of the phrase "so they
call it" is this. The author disclaims any share in the origination of what he
is giving. He tells us that he is merely repeating what has been taught for ages
and ages, without any addition or alteration on his part.

the thoughtactivities of right belief (Samyaktva), conduct (Charitra). with
partial (Desha,) and full (Sakala, vows), (and) ideal conduct (Yathakhyata
charitra), (are) the passions (Kashayas). (Their) number (is) four, sixteen, and
innumerable (times the spatial units in) the universe. 163 Commentary. The four
passions are: Anger (Krodha,) Pride (Mana), Deceit (Maya) and Greed (Lobha).
Each of these is of 4 kinds: error feeding, Anantanu-bandhi which destroys right
belief; partial-vow-preventing, Apratyakhyanavarana, which destroys such right
conduct as consists in the observance of partial vows; total-vow-preventing,
Pratyak hanavarana which destroys such right. conduct as consists in the
observance of full vows; and perfect-right-conduct preventing, Sanjvalana, which
destroys ideal right conduct. Thus there are 16 kinds of the 4 passions, The
error-feeding-passions keep us in the first spiritual stage of wrong belief
Mithyatva or tend to bring us down from 4th to the 2nd stage. Partial-vow-
preventing passions keep us in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th stages. Total-vow-
preventing-passions keep us in the 5th stage. Perfect-right-conduct-preventing-
passions keep us in the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th stages, and bring us back
from the 11th. In the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th stages there are no passions,
except in the 11th stage where they are in a quiescent form, and bring the soul
back to the 10th and lower stages. In this and the last Gatha, two etymological
derivations of the word Kashaya are given. In the first, it is derived from
Krisha to plough, because it ploughs the field of Karmas of which the soul reaps
the fruit. In this it is derived from Kasha to destroy, because it destroys the
right-belief and right conduct of the soul. silapuDhavibheda dhUlI jalarAisamA o

represent the intensity of the feeling of anger and the more or less lasting
impression which it produces. They do not correspond to the 4 sub-classes,

; like 2 sensed etc., beings (in Gatha 179), by dividing by an innumerable part
of a wink (Avali). Or (it) may be got from the instants of their duration.
Commentary, Let us illustrate how to find out the comparative number of humans
affected by each passion at one instant. Let the number of total humans be
100500 y passion-less humans be ... 500 Then the number of humans with passion
is ... 100000 * Let the innumerable part of an avali be 10. Divide 100000 by
10=10000. And 100000 - 10000=90000. Divide 90000 equally into 4 parts, and let
the quotient, 22,500, be allotted to greed, deceit, anger and pride, each. Now
divide the remaining one part, 10000, again by 10, the innumerable part of an
Avali. We get 1000. 10000 -1000-9000. This should be added to the above
allotment. And we find the number of humans with greed = 22500 + 9001 = 31500.
Again divide the balance 1000, by 10. We get 100. Then 1000-100 - 900. This
should be added to the second class. Then humans with deceit would be 22500 +
900=23400. Again divide 100 by 10 - 10. 100-10=90 should be added to third
class. Then humans with anger will be 22500+ 90-22590. The balance 10 should be
added to 4th class, then humans with ride will be 22500+10=22510.

get number of sub-humans. The second process of finding out the comparative
numbers as given in the gatha is illustrated as follows: " Let the instants of
an Antara-muhurta of duration of all the passions be 10000 and the total number
of passionate humans be 100000, and the innumerable part of an Avali 10. "" Then
divide 10000 instants by 10-1000. Then 10000-1000-9000. This should be divided
equally into the four passions, greed, deceit, anger and pride, i. e.
9000/4-2250. The balance 1000 should again be divided by 10, and we get 100.
Then 1000-100-900, should be added to greed. Then it will be = 2250+900=3150. ""
The balance 100 should again be divided by 10. We get 10. 100-10-90. This should
be added to deceit, we have then 2250+90-2340. "" The balance 10 should again be
divided by 10. We get 1. 10-1-9. This should be added to anger, we have then

instants of 4 passions will be 3150 +2340 +2259 +2251-10000. Now we should find
out the number of humans by rule of three. In 10000 instants there are 100000

operation of error-feeding-passions. The 3rd, mixed stage is mentioned here. The
4th stage is where right knowledge begins. In the 4th and 5th stages all the

Commentary. Right scriptural knowledge is that which keeps one engaged in the
thinking and writing of truth leading to liberation of the soul ; and that which
appertains to temporal matters, and onesided views is called wrong scriptural
knowledge. From this spiritual point of view, all literature and teaching of
matters relating to the commission, as well as the prevention and detection of
offences, literature of fiction, and impossible stories, propagation of
doctrines which cannot be established by logical arguments, and all light,
vulgar, and obscene literature are all instances of wrong scriptural knowledge.

 178 * THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. Commentary. In this and the 2 preceding
Gathas, three kinds of wrong knowledge are described. The Gathas are merely
illustrative. They roughly exemplify rather than define and distinguish 3 kinds
of wrong knowledge. The point to grasp is this, that wrong knowledge is
certainly as much knowledge as right knowledge. The method and means of
acquisition of both are the same. The character of the scope and limitations is
the same. But the result is totally different in the 2 cases. In one it is
knowledge of things as they are; in the others it is not so, it is perverse,
contrary or otherwise distorted. This is called wrong knowledge. For example,
take the teachings of Mahabharata and Ramayana. The outlines of the story are
certainly true. But their description is some times so grotescue that it must be
called perversion of truth, for instance no one can believe in the literal truth
of an army of monkeys being marched against the human hosts of the proud Lord of
Lanka. If the reader believes such incidents to be literally true, he would
certainly have wrong scriptural knowledge.

is standing submerged in water, when I look at it and I have direct knowledge
only of the tip of its living trunk, I have an inferential perception of the
whole body of the elephant, although I do not see it. Or when I see a beautiful
face or an ox, I think of the lovely moon or the animal cow. This reminiscence
of similar qualities of beauty and cow, is knowledge of something hidden

Scriptural knowledge is of two kinds: - 1. Lettered or verbal (Aksharatmaka), 2.
Letterless or nonverbal (Anakshratmaka). Verbal scriptural knowledge is derived
from words which are composed of letters (Akshara) spoken or written; as when

seeing and hearing gives us merely sensitive knowledge. What more we think about

or spoken. E. G., you feel cold air; the knowledge of coldness is sensitive
knowledge by means of touch of the skin. If you do not like it, that is
unpleasant, it is (non-verbal) scriptu knowledge. It is derived from your
knowledge of feeling of cold, which cannot be reduced to a mere word, written or
spoken. Verbal scriptural knowledge is possible only in rational beings. All the
irrationals (asamjni) have only non-verbal scriptural knowledge. Their sensitive
knowledge is confined to perception (Avagraha) by the 5 senses, and
indeterminate preception by all, except the eye. So, the irrationals have got
only 9 out of 28 divisions. The rationals (Sanjni) have the non-verbal
scriptural knowledge also. Verbal scriptural knowledge (Aksharatmaka) is also
called Shabda Jnana or Shabdaja produced by words. Non-verbal (Anakshratmaka)
scriptural knowledge is also called Linga-Jnana or Lingaja, produced by signs.

In the non-verbal (Anaksharatmaka scriptural knowledge there) are innumerable
times the spatial units of universe places with 6 (fold increase;) (The number
of different individual letters) in the verbal (scriptural knowledge is) 6th

Commentary. 6 fold increase - (1) Increase by an infinite part (Ananta Bhaga
vriddhi) i. e. by adding an infinite part to the original. 2. Increase by
innumerable part (Asankhyata Bhaga Vriddhi.) 3. Increase by a numerable part

Guna Vriddhi) i. e. numerable times added to the former. 5. Increase by
innumerable times (Asankhyata Guna Vriddhi.) (6) Increase by infinite times
(Ananta Guna Vriddhi .) The 6th term-expression { (((((2)*)+-)+-) 2)= } 2 this
is called Ek - atthi. In this series the basic number is 2, and the index is
also 2, each term is the square of the index of the immediately preceding term.
Therefore it is called Dvirupavarga Dhara, because all the figures in it are 2
and the indices grow in a series of two to the power two, etc. The number of
twos in any term is one more than the number of the term in the series and the
number of the twos in the index is the number of the term itself. Thus the
fourth term has 4 twos as its index and 5 twos in all. It is called Pannatthi.
It is equal to 65536. The 5th term in the series has 5 twos in index and 6 in
all. It is called Vadala. It is equal to (65536)*. The 6th term has 6 twos in
index and 7 in all. It is called Ekatthi is equal to ( 65536 ) 4. The number of
different unrepeated letters (Apunurukta Akshara) and their unrepeated
combinations employed in the whole of the scriptures is (Ekatthi) - 1 { (65536 )

because continuous wanderings in the same absolutely lowest form of existence
cause the greatest pain, and generate the most instense kind of conation and

towards the last of its mean births, it has absolutely the lowest degree of

 188 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. > > 3, 33 326. The preceding increase
having been repeated (as many times as there are spatial units) in an
innumerable part of a (linear, finger, the next increase takes place one time.
Certainly this is done again and again till the last increase, (i. e. every one
of 6 increases is repeated an innumerable part of a linear finger before the
next one is taken). Commentary. Six fold increase may best be explained by an
illustrative statementLet infinite be represented by innumerable ,, numerable ,
, 2. and let the first figure subject to increase be 48. (1) Infinite part
increase = 48 + 4 = 48 + 6 = 54. (2) Innumerable, =- 54.51-54 + 18 - 72, (3)
Numerable , = 72+ 7 = 72 + 36-108. (4) Numerable fold = 108 108 x 2-108 + 216
-324, (5) Innumerable fold = 324 + 324 x 3-324 +972-1296. (6) Infinite fold , ,
-1296 + 1296 x 8 1295 + 10368 - 11664. Thus if all the 6 kinds of increase take
effect once on 48, it would amount to 11664. Now let us see how this six-fold
increase takes effect as stated in gatha 326, on the minimum scriptural
knowledge called paryaya knowledge, possessed by a non-developablo tine Nigoda
vegetable vide gatha 321. The infinite part increase takes place as many times
as there are spatial units in an innumerable part of a linear finger
(Suchiangula), thereafter the innumerable part increase takes place only once.
And again the infinite part increase takes place as many times as there are
spatial units in an innumerable part of a linear finger, after which, the
innumerable part increase shall take place a second time. Then again the
infinite part increase shall happen as before, and the innumerable part increase
once again. Proceeding in this manner the innumerable part increase should take
place as many times as there are spatial units in an innumerable part of a
linear finger. Then again the infinite part increase should take place as many
times as there are spatial units in an innumerable part of a linear finger.
There-after the numerable part increase

 GOMMATASARA. 189 shall take place once, and the process of infinite part
increase and innumerable part increase repeated as above; there-after the
numerical part shall take place the second time. The process should be repeated
again and again to complete the numerical part increase as many times as there
are spatial units in an innumerable part of a linear finger. The process of
infinite part increase and innumerable part increase should again be exhausted,
the same number of times as above. Then again infinite part increase shall take
place as many times as there are spatial units etc., etc., etc. Thereafter the
numerable fold increase shall once take place. The whole of the preceding
process from the very beginning being repeated we shall have numerable fold
increase a second time. The repetition of the process should be done as many
times as there are spatial units in an innumerable part of a linear finger and
then we shall have the numerable fold increase the same number of times. Now
again the process from the very beginning should be repeated to complete the
innumerable part increase, and numerable part increase and again the innumerable
part increase the same number of times, then infinite part increase should be
done the same number of times, afterwards once innumerable fold increase should
be done. In order to complete this innumerable fold increase the same number of
times, the same process from the very beginning should be repeated the same
number of times. Now-again the process preceding the first innumerable fold
increase should be repeated. Then after making infinite part increase as many
times as there are spatial units in innumerable part of a linear finger,
infinite fold increase should be done once. The number thus gained will be the
last figure of the six-fold increase. This figure should be taken as the first
figure for calculating the second six-fold increase. Such six-fold increases
effected innumerable times, the innumerable spatial units of the universe
represent the extent of Paryaya-Samasa-knowledge. For further details see
Sanskrit commentary of Gommatsara. The following table will show how the
repetition of increases is done. U refers to infinite part. 4 to innumerable
part, 5 to numerable part, 6 to numerable fold, 7 to innumerable fold and 8 to
infinite fold. The recurrence of any one or more of these figures means their
repetition as many times as there are spatial units in an innumerable part of a
linear finger.

 210 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. 379. We do not know the length, breadth and
height in space of minimum visual (knowledge) separately. But its cubic volume
(Samikarana) is the extent in space of minimum (Visual knowledge.) Commentary.
The extent in space of the body of a fine completely undevelopable common soul
in the 3rd instant from its birth being the absolute minimum cannot be reduced
to its length, breadth, and height, in any linear measure which can be
conprehended by the human mind. This is what is meant in the gatha. Otherwise
there are innumerable spatial-units even in the space occupied by this body, and
each one of them is perfectly plain to the all-knowledge of the Omniscient.

the desired number (Ichchita rashi). Commentary. Suppose the desired number is

Divide the number of halvings of the (spatial units of the) universe by the
number of halvings of (an innumerable part of an Avali) Deya. By the quotient
divide the sum of the series (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 etc., upto the term represented by
the desired division) Multiply the (spatial units of the) universe, by
themselves as many times as the number of this last quotient (We then) get the
multiplier for any division of high Visual knowledge. (The same process will
apply in respect of every division) till the last one. Commentary. Let the
spatial units of universe be 256, and the innumerable part of an avali be 16. We
have to find out the multiplier of its third division. The halvings of 256 are
8; and those of 16 are 4. Now 8:4 2 . The sum of series 1+2+3-6. And 6:-2-3.
Therefore 2563 is the number by which the extent and time of maximum partial

himself with, or, makes his own the demerit (Papa) and merit (Punya) is the
(thought) paint (Bhava Leshya). So it has been described by the knowers of the
attributes of Paint (Leshya). Commentary, Thought-paint seems to be a better
expression than thought colour. Colour is a part of the thing itself. Paint is
something imposed from without. The soul is immaterial (Amurti), and colour
(Varna) is an essential and peculiar attribute of Matter (spartha rasa geSa
varNavantaH pudgalAH) Thought-colour and thought forms are familiar to all
students of Theosophy. See " Thought Forms by Mrs. Besant and C. W. Leadbeater
1905." There are differences in arrangement, and in description also here and
there. The definite, and unbridgeable demarcation between living and non-living,
which characterises Jainism so beautifully is sometimes lost sight of. The soul,
i.e., consciousness and also every modification of this consciousness, i.e.
thought-activity, is immaterial and colourless. Colour is in matter; and matter
certainly acts and reacts upon the soul by Inflow, Bondage, etc., due to
Passions and Vibrations. jogapauttI lessA kasAyaudayANuraMjiyA hoi  /  tatto

activity (Yoga) determines the nature of Karmic matter (Prakriti) and the number
of Karmic molecules (Pradesha) which bind the soul. The passions (kashaya) by
their intensity, etc. determine the duration of bondage (Sthiti), and strong or

Commentary. Bad passion-places correspond to the three bad thought-paints,
black, blue and grey, and good passion-places to yellow, pink, and white. The
total number of places being divided by a smaller kind of innumerable universe

In thought-paints, (the change) in their own. place (Svasthana) from the maximum
(is) by minimum decrease (i. e., decrease by infinite part, Ananta Bhaga Hani)

minimum (of every thought paint) to other place (Parasthana) is by decrease

and three are good. Black, blue and grey are bad. The thought activity in black
is the worst. Pale, pink, and white are good. The best thought activity is in
white. In each thought-paint, the change in degrees, from the highest impurity
or purity to the lowest impurity or purity, respectively, will be by infinite
part. But when it is to be transformed into its next thought-paint of low
impurity or purity the change will be by infinite fold decrease. The highest
impurity in black-thought-paint having decreased to its last decrease of
infinite part, is at its lowest point of impurity. But the minimum impurity in
the next, namely the blue thought-paint, will be by infinite fold decrease in
the lowest impurity of black-thought-paint. And so on. saMkamaNe chaTThANA

from the trunk is of blue-paint. He who wishes to cut the large branches is of

from black to blue 6 places decrease. blue to grey 6 >> white to pink 6 ,, pink
to yellow 6 These 24+2 said above are the 26 parts of thought-paints. Out of
these, 8 parts are for age-bondage only. In the chapter on passions we have
given a diagram to Gatha 295. It shows that the force of passions is classified
into four kinds (1) Intenser like stone (2) intense like earth, (3) mild like
dust, (4) milder like water. In the first stone-kind, there are 2 divisions, in
the last or most intense of black no age Karma is bound, but in the next
division. which is a kind of medium intense black, hellish age only is bound. In
the second earth-kind, there are medium conditions of all the six thought-
paints; bondage of all the four kinds of age Karma is possible there. In the
third dust-kind, also there are 6 thoughtpaints of medium mild kind, where also
all the four age Karmas * are bound: but in places where black thought paint is
absent, there is such a mild degree of five other thought-paints, that only
celestial age-Karma is bound. Its last portions do not bind any age Karma. The
fourth, water kind is the mildest and cannot bind any age-Karma. Thus it will be
seen that out of 24 medium places of thoughtpaints there are only 8 such special
medium kinds of thought-paints. which only have the capacity of binding age-
Karmas. Rule for bondage of age Karma in humans and sub-humans of work-region
(Karma bhumi) for future incarnation is, that when two-third of their operative
age-Karma is exhausted, the first occasion, where a soul may bind age-Karma
appears for one antar-mu: hurta. Then again after the expiry of two-third of the
remaining age-Karma, the second occasion for bondage of age-Karma appears for an
antar-muhurta. Thus after expiry of every two-third part of the remaining age,
six more occasions for bondage of age-karma will in succession be presented to
the soul. If a soul cannot have the required kind of medium thought-paint in any
of these 8 occasions which are called Apakarsha-Kala or declining-times, he must
bind it in the last antar-muhurta of his life. It should be noted that a soul
will bind only one of the four age Karmas. He cannot bind more than one. He will
gain rebirth in the same condition of existence corresponding to the particular
ageKarma bound for future life. It should also be noted that duration

or decreased in other declining-times, if age-Karma has already been bound in
any previous declining time. In order to illustrate the eight periods of
declining-times let us suppose that a human being has got his operative age
Karma for a duration of 6561 years. Then the 8 occasions will appear as shown
below: Declining times. | Period of remaining age. (1) After expiry of or 4374

only 9 months are left in completion of their life-duration. Celestials and
hellish beings bind it, when only six months are left in their life. All these
also have the eight declining-times in the period of 9 or 6 months,
respectively. Humans and sub-humans of work-region where 8 decliningtimes for
bondage of age-Karma occur during full length of their age are called
Sopakramayushka or with breakable age. They can die early by untimely shedding
off of age-Karma molecules on account of suicide, murder, incurable disease,
fire, railway accident etc. If no such disturbance occur, they would die after
completing their age-Karma fully. Celestials, hellish, humans and subhumans of
enjoyment-region as well as some great men out of 63 Shalaka Purushas (24
Tirthankars, 12 Chakravarties, 9 Narayanas, 9 Balbhadras, and 9 Prati-
narayanas), who attain liberation from that life are called Anupakramayushka or

always in that condition of existence for which he has bound to himself the age
Karma in the eight decliningtimes in which the age-Karma can be bound in life,
but the death point is also important, as it seriously affects the future
condition of the soul. If no age Karma is bound in the 8 declining-times, then
the duration of age-Karma and the condition of existence, both, are determined
within the Antar-muhurta which precedes death by an innumerable part of a wink
or Avali called Asankshepaddha. But if the age Karma has been bound in one of
the previous eight declining-times (Apakarsha-Kala), the condition of existence
(Gati) will remain the same, but the soul will go to a higher or lower part of
it, according to the character and degree of the thought-paint at the time of

thought-paints (yellow, pink and white). Commentary. The right believing
potentially developable soul in enjoyment regions has the minimum grey-thought
paint, because dying as a right believer he was bound to be born as a male
heavenly being, but before he acquired right belief he may have bound an age-
Karma for a lower condition of existence. If this condition was human or sub-
human then instead of going to heaven he will have to go to the highest
enjoyment-region, where we have the best human and sub-human life. The thought-
activity at death time of such a soul will be a little painful, and therefore he
has minimum greythought-paint also, although in the enjoyment-regions, there are

9th, 10th, 12th, and 13th) of deluding-Karma (Moha) is thought.(paint) (Bhava
Leshya). Commentary Here vibratory activity would seem to be the same as
thoughtpaint. Yoga and Leshya, i.e., Vibration and thought-paint are really not
two things but two aspects of the same thing, with the distinction that in one
the vibratory activity alone is considered and in the other it is considered as
mixed with and coloured by the passions. The vibratory activity is the same. It
is never without the tint or taint of passion of some kind or other which is
found only in the first 10 stages. The passion-coloured vibration is the
thought-paint in these 10 stages. In the next three there is no passion, but
there is ation, which results in white thought-paint, the purest and highest
kind of thought-paint. Here although there is no passion, thought-paint is said
to exist, because its basis, the vibration still continues, although there is no
passion to taint it with any colour.

 GOMMATASARA. 269 Notice also that the passionless vibratory-activity is still
the cause of inflow of Karmic and Quasi-Karmic matter into the soul. The quasi-
Karmic matter, i.e., Aharaka, speech, mind, and electric molecules are
assimilited, but the Karmic molecules merely touch the soul for an instant and
pass away without binding. Note also that where there is no passion there is
inflow only of the molecules of pleasant feeling-Karma (sata vedaniya). Where
there is passion, there is an inflow every instant of all the Karmas except the
age Karma. ..Sub-Chapter X.-Number (Sankhya). kiNhAdirAsimAvali asaMkhabhAgeNa

3525, and let an innumerable part of an Avali be 5. Then 3525-5 - 705. And
3525-705-2820. And 2820 should be equally distributed among the three thought-
paints. And 2820 : 3 940, which should be assigned to each of the three thought-
paints. 705 should again be divided by 5. And the quotient 141, being subtracted
from 705, and the balance added to 940, we get 705-141-940 - 1504.

the souls) with three good (thought-paints is) innumerable part of the universe.
Commentary. Here place or Kshetra signifies the space where at a particular time
the souls with respective thought-paints are found. Fine one-sensed beings, with
three bad-paints, are pervading through out the whole universe. Svasthana is of
two kinds, (1) Svasthana Svasthana, the place of their birth (2) Viharavat
Svasthana, the place to which they can go out. Samudghata or overflow means the
extending of spatial units of mundane souls out of body to some extent and then
resuming their former form. Souls do not leave their own body, but extend out.
There are seven occasions when such overflow is possible: - (1) Vedana
samudghata, pain-overflow, emanation on account of extreme and unbearable
suffering. (2) Kashaya samudghata, passion-overflow, emanation on account of
passionate thought activity.

 GOMMATASARA. 273 (3) Vaikriyika samudghata, fluid overflow-emanation on account
of transformation into small or large fluid body or into many such bodies.
Celestials do not leave their own place, they send their newly made fluid body
with extending soul-units to far off places. Their connection is never ceased.
(4) Maranantika samudghata, death-bed overflow-emanation before death for
touching the place of next birth. The soul extends to that point and then
contracts and dies thereafter. (5) Taijasa samudghata, electric overflow-It is
possible in ts with special powers obtained by ascetic practices. It is bad or
good. If a saint gets in rage, his soul-units emanate from his left shoulder
with electrical matter, and burn the undesirable object. This is bad. A saint
being compassionate at seeing famine or disease prevaling anywhere, emanates his
soul-units with electric matter from right shoulder. It removes all cause of
trouble and brings happiness. (6) Aharaka Samudghata, assimilative overflowA
saint in 6th scriptural stage emanates a man-like white form of one cubit from
his head with soul-units. It goes to an omniscient or saint with full scriptural
knowledge and sees him. The saint either removes his doubt or enjoys the benefit
of personally paying respect to him. (7) Kevali Samudghata, omniscient overflow-
when age Karma has a smaller duration than that of other three Karmas, body-
making, family-determining and feeling, then the soul of an omniscient Conqueror
overflows and expands throughout the whole universe in 4 instants, and then
withdraws to its body in another 4 instants, and the duration of all four Karmas
becomes equal. Upapada means extent of space in the first instant of birth after
leaving the last body. Place should be considered with reference to the above
ten conditions, the two Svasthana, seven Samudghata and Upapada. Souls with bad
thought-paints are not found in electric, assimilative, and omniscient overflow.

in distant (overflow), and an innumerable part of it (is) in birthplace
(Upapada). Commentary. This gatha mainly refers to the celestials of Saudharma
and Ishana heavens. They are with pale thought-paint. The total number of them
is equal to spatial units in the universe line (Jagat shreni) multiplied by a
third square root of a cubic finger. Their total being divided by an innumerable
part of a Palya, the quotient is the number of those dying in one instant: This
quotient should again be divided by an innumerable part of a Palya. The
resulting quotient being subtracted from the preceding quotient the balance
called "many parts" is the number of those in transmigration with one, two or
three turns. This number should again be divided by an innumerable part of a
Palya, the quotient being subtracted from the number, the remaining "many parts"
balance is the number of those in death-bed overflow. This number being divided
by an innumerable part of a palya, the quotient is he number of those with
distant death-bed overflow. This number should again be divided by an
innumerable part of a Palya, the quotient is the number of those in the birth-
instant. The number found above multiplied by the place of one soul gives the
total place for that. For the number of pink and white thought-paints and other
details see Sanskrit commentary. sukkassa samugghAde asaMkhabhAgA ya savvalogo

past and is in the present. Generally the extent of soul with three bad paints
is the whole universe for their own place (Svasthana), overflow (Samudghata) and
first instant of birth. In details, the black-paint souls out of the ten places
called Padas, for their sphere of birth (Svasthana Swasthana), anguish (Vedna),

birth in transmigration (Upapada) have the whole Universe as their extent. _
Their extent (Sparsha) of sphere of motion (Viharavat-svasthana) is basic area
(Jagatpratar) multiplied by numerable linear finger (Suchi-angula). In their
transformation overflow (vaikriyika Samudghata) it is a numerable part of the
universe. In the black-thought-paint there is no electric (Taijasa) Aharka and
omniscient (Kevala) overflow. The extent of blue and grey should be known like

 278 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. Commentary. For the celestial and hellish
beings the extra time is equal to 2 Antar-muhurta, because their thought-paint
begins one Antarmuhurta before they are born and continues for one Antara-
muhurta after their death. The extra time for yellow and pink is little less
than half Sagara. It is thus. Saudharma and ishana heavenly beings have the
maximum age of 2 Sagaras, but if a right believer with interrupted age (Ghata-
yushka) dies prematurely and is born there, he may have an age of 23 Sagaras
minus one Antar-muhurta. Similarly a wrong believer dying prematurely can add an
extra innumerable part of a Palya to his age. These 2 extras are possible up to
the 12th heaven, because no one dying prematurely can be born beyond it. A
little less than half Sagara will be added to the prescribed age of each pair of
heavens till the 12th heaven. Sub-Chapter XI V Interval (Antara).

minimum and maximum interval of the three (black, blue and grey thought-paints)
is one Antarmuhurta and a little more than 33 Sagaras. This has been said. It is
the same for the three yellow (pink and white), but the maximum intervals are
necessarily the innumerable matter cycles of existences (Pudgala Parivartana),
Commentary, Interval means time spent in other thought-paints before regaining
the one which was left. A soul born in Videha with one crore of Purya age,
acquires black thought-paint at the age of 8 vears minus 6 Antar-muhurtas, then
he changes into blue, grey, pale, pink and white gradually, each in one Antar-
muhurta. Then

remaining life, and after death goes to Sarvarth-siddhi for 33 Sagars. There he
keeps his white thought-paint. Then he is born a man and for one Antara-muhurta
he remains in white paint. Then he begins to transform from white to pink, pale,
grey and blue and black each in one Antara-muhurta. The interval for black is
thus 33 Sagars, 1 crore Purva years minus 8 years and 10 Antar-muhurtas. This
example will show interval of blue and grey also with, respectively, 2 and 4
Antara-muhurtas less than black. The intervals for the other three thought-
paints is no doubt a long time, for only five sensed beings can have them. If a
soul has to pass from one-sensed to 4-sensed lives, he can pass a long time
there with only 3 bad thought-paints. After a long time, he may become again
five-sensed with pale thought-paint. Sub-Chapter XV & XVI.-Modifications and

described. Commentary. The least number is of those with white thought-paint,
yet It is innumerable. Its innumerable-fold is the number of those with pink
thought-paint. Its numerable fold is the number of those with pale thought-
paint. Its infinite fold is the number of souls with grey thought paint. A

(Abhavya). They are never liberated from mundane existence. Commentary, Souls as
seen by omniscient are of two kinds, Bhavya, capable of liberation, and Abhavya,
incapable of liberation. Even in Bhavyas, who have got the capacity, only those
who will have favourable circumstances for making efforts for liberation can
attain liberation, while those who will never have favourable circumstances will
never be liberated. bhavvattassa joggA je jIvA te havaMti bhavasiddhA  /  hu

kinds of Parivartana, cycle of wandering: (1) Dravya-Parivartana, matter cycle.
It is of two kinds, quasikarmic and karmic. No-karma, quasi-karmic cycle is the
time which soul takes in the renewing exactly the same set of a particular
number and quality of molecules, as it took once. Karmic cycle is the time taken
in-renewing exactly the same set of a particu number and quality of 8 karmas, as
the soul took in once. The time taken in both of these is called one matter
cycle or dravya or pudgala parivartana. For example a soul takes on a body to
day, with its quasi-karmic and karmic matter. It goes on changing both. When in
the course of its changes, it again chances to take on a similar body with
similar quasi-karmic and karmic matter, it is said to have completed one matter
cycle (Dravya Parivartana). (2) Kshetra Parivartana. Space-Cycle. The time taken

Avasarpini, then in the 3rd samaya of a third, and so on; till in the last
samaya it is born in the last samaya of a new Avasarpini. Similarly it must be
born in Utsarpini. Then it must die in each samaya of the two eras, like the
above. The time taken to go through all this is a Time-Cycle(KalaParivartama.)
(4) Bhava-parivartana, Incarnation-cycle, a soul is born in hell with minimum
age of 10,000 years. He is reborn again (after other births) in hell with 10,000
years ago. This goes on as many times as there are samayas in 10,000 years. Then
he is reborn there with an age of 10,000 years, and one samaya, then with an age
of 10,000 years and 2 samayas, and thus at every birth, he adds one samaya till
he is born with the maximum age of 33 Sagaras. The time taken is called Hellish-
Cycle. Similarly with the Celestial-Cycle; but there the minimum is 10,000 years
and the maximum is only 31 Sagaras, up to the 9th Graiveyaka. In the sub-human
and human-Cycles the minimum is one Antar-muhurta, and the maximum is 3 palyas.
The procedure is the same as in the Hellish and Celestial-Cycles. The time taken
in all these four cycles, is called one Incarnation-Cycle. (5) Bhava-
Parivartana. Thought-Cycle. Innumerable units of soul's, Yoga-sthana, Vibratory
activity make one Anubhaga-bandha-Adhyavasaya-sthana, or a degree of the passion
which determines intensity of bondage. Innumerable xinnumerable, Anubhaga-
bandhas make one Kashaya-dhya-vasaya sthana. 2. e., one degree of passion which
determines the duration of bondage. Innumerable x innumerable Kashaya, etc.,
make one Jaghanya-sthiti-bandha, i. e., minimum duration of bondage in a
rational wrong-believing person. This is Antah crore X crore sagars. One sthiti
needs that the soul should pass through everyone of the innumerable Yoga-
sthanas, to earn one Anubhaga-bandha and then so on, to earn one sthiti. Thus it
should go up to the maximum duration of each one of the 8 Karmas, of course
adding only one samaya at each step onwards from the minimum duration. When it
has thus gone through the 8 karmas and their 148 divisions, it is said to have
done one Thought-Cycle (Bhava-parivartana).

(Vartate) itself by increasing by 6 increases or by decreasing by (6) decreases
in its infinitesimal degrees (Avibhaga Pratichheda). Commentary. In all
substances whether pure or impure, natural modifications of 6 fold increase and
6 fold decrease in infinitesimal degrees of the common attribute of
individuality do occur at every instant. It is due to this sort of change that
we can attribute rise (Utpada), decay (Vyaya), and continuity (Dhrauvya) in pure
souls (Siddhas), and to pure Space, time, media (substances) of motion and rest.
These changes are called natural modifications (Svabhava Paryaya). For six-fold
increase and decrease see Gatha 322 and those which follow. ya pariNamadi sayaM

(Avalis). Commentary, In every period of 6 months and 8 instants, 608 souls
leave the primitive common, or Nitya Nigoda, condition; and the same number of
souls, enter the abode of liberation from the 2 continents. The number of
siddhas or liberated souls is infinite part of the total of all the souls
(mundane and liberated). 6 months and 8 Samayas being reduced to Avalis and
divided by 608 would be the numerable Avali mentioned in the gatha. It would be
noticed that the numerable Avalis in the Gatha are constant. They do not vary.
They represent the average time for one soul to attain liberation. The number of
liberated souls increases every 6 months and 8 instants by 608. This explains
the ever-increasing-length of past time by the constant number of of Avalis.

 GOMMATASARA. Commentary. An atom as long as it has got only one degree of
smoothness or roughness will neither unite with another atom with one degree nor
with other atoms of more degrees. But when degrees of smoothness or roughness
are increased in that very atom owing to internal capacity of change and
auxiliary cause of other substances, it becomes fit for bondage with other atoms
possessing 2 degrees in excess. riddhidaraguNA ahiyA hoNaM pariNAmayaMti

rule for the union of molecules also. A molecule of 500 degrees will unite with
another of 502 only, neither more nor less. Any atom or molecule uniting with
another of less degrees than two will transform it into its own kind. When a

innumerable part of a Palya), numerable times (of this last product), and
innumerable times (this last number). Commentary. Partial vow stage is found in
human and sub-human beings. The innumerable part of a Palya souls in this stage
as given above refer to sub-humans, and 13 crores of humans should be added to
that number. Downfall stage is found in all the four conditions of existence. In
this stage there are 52 crores of humans also, and the souls in the other three
conditions of existence number innumerable times the souls with partial vow. The
mixed stage of rightand-wrong-belief is also found in the four conditions of
existence. In this stage the humans are 104 crores; and the number of souls in
the other 3 conditions of existence is the numerable times the total of those in
downfall stage. The vowless right-belief is also found in the four conditions.
In it the number of humans is 700 crores; and the number of the other 3 is the
innumerable times the total of those with mixed right and wrong belief. The
division of Palya by innumerable representing the number of partial vowers means
that the Palya is to be divided 3 times by the innumerable and then once by
numerable. In the downfall stage, Palya is divided twice by innumerable and then
once by numerable. In the mixed stage, Palya is divided twice by innumerable.
And in the vowless stage, Palya is divided once by innumerable.

 316 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. 646. The belief which is caused by the
destruction of right belief-deluding Karma (Darshana Moha and 4 errorfeeding-
passions sub-classes of right-conduct-deludingKarma) is perfectly pure. It (is)
destructive right-belief (Kshayika Samyaktva so called as it destroys the causes
of wrong belief entirely). (It is) eternal and (is) the cause of destruction of
Karmas. Commentary. A soul which has acquired destructive right-belief can
attain liberation in the same life. But if before or after its acquisition the
soul binds celestial-age-Karma, he will be born as a celestial and if before its
acquisition the soul has bound hellish-age-Karma, will be reborn in the first
and not in a lower hell, will thereafter be reborn as a man, and then attain
liberation. A soul which has acquired destructive right-belief will thus surely
attain liberation in the third life. But if before acquiring destructive right-
belief he had bound a human, or sub-human age-Karma, he would be reborn in the
enjoyment-region, from where he would be reborn as a celestial and then as a man
in work-region and attain liberation in his 4th life. Note that destructive
right-belief never leaves the soul once it has been acquired. So in hell also
there are some souls with right-belief who are just waiting to attain liberation
in their next birth. Raja Shrenika alias Bimbasara, father of Ajit-shatru a
contemporary and a follower of Lord Mahavira and a devout listener to the
letterless speech (Anakshari Vani) in his Samavasarana is such a soul in the
first hell. Before attaining destructive rightbelief he had bound a hellish-age-
Karma of the maximum kind of 33 Sagaras, on account of having put a dead snake,
round the neck of Saint Yeshodhara in meditation. Then he repented and
ultimately in the Samavasarana of Lord Mahavira acquired perfect rightbelief and
then in the subsequent declining times (Apakarshana Kala) though he could not
change the character of th age Karma he had already bound, he reduced the
maximum duration of 33 Sagaras of the 7th hell to 84,000 years in the 1st hell,
where the minimum is 10,000 years. Thus he has passed about 2,500 years in hell,
from where he would be reborn in BharataKshetra after nearly 81,500 years as
Padma Nabha, the 1st Tirthankara in the beginning of the third aeon of the next
or Utsarpini 'cycle of time and attain liberation after having re-proclaimed
Jainism in Bharata-kshetra. It is interesting to note that the

 GOMMATASARA. continuity of Jain tradition is curiously evident in the above
account. Before the last Tirthankara of the present cycle attained liberation,
his teaching was already implanted in a soul so firmly that when the proper time
comes it should fructify as exactly the same teaching from the mouth of the
first Tirthankara of the next cycle. Lord Mahavira attained liberation 3 years
and 8 months before the expiry of the 4th Aeon of the present cycle. The present
or the 5th aeon is 21,000 years long, the next one the sixth and the last of the
present cycle is also of 21,000 years' duration. The next cycle retraces the
course of the present cycle, so that its first two Aeons will be 21,000 years
each. And after nearly 84,000 years after Lord Mahavira's liberation the soul of
Raja Shrenika which has literally been under the earth for the whole of this
long length of darkness will be reborn and blossom forth as Padma Nabha, the
propounder afresh of Eternal Truth. vayaNehiM vidUhiM vi iMdiyabhaya ANaehiM

begun the destruction of right belief-deluding Karma and is on the process of
destruction may die and go to any of the four conditions of life. He will

(Prayogya), (5) efficiency (Karana), the first four are common (i 8. attainable
by all), but the efficiency Karana) is attained only by (soul capable of) right-
belief, (and liberation). Commentary. Kshayopasama-Labdhi, destructive-
subsidential attainment, is attainment by a soul (by the subsidence, destruction
and operation of certain Karmas) of such senses, mind, etc., that he may be able
to acquire right-belief. Vishuddhi Labdhi-virtue attainment, is attainment of a
disposi. tion for good, and against bad actions. Deshana Labdhi, precept
attainment, is attainment of an inclination to know the Truth. This reduces the
Sthiti, duration of Karmas except the Ayukarma, the age Karma, to a maximum of
Antar Koda Kodi, inter crore of crore, Sagaras and a minimum of one crore
(Sagaras). Prayogya-Labdhi, competency-attainment, is attainment of thought
activity which further reduces the Sthiti, duration of the 7 * Karmas, i.e., all
except the Ayukarma, age-Karma. But as to intensity of fruition the reduction
applies only to demeritorious Karmas. The meritorious Karmas are proportionally
increased in intensity of fruition (Anubhaga). Karana Labdhi -efficiency
attainment, is attainment of thoughtactivity which must cause right-belief in
one Antar-muhurta, within 48 minutes. cadugadibhavvo saraNI pajjatto sujjhago ya
