## Agam Sutra 38, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Jita Kalp'
[38] Jita Kalp
Chhed Sutra-5 - Hindi Translation Sutra -1
Paying homage to the (scripture) of the discourse, I will briefly speak of atonement and charity. (In the five practices mentioned in Agam, Sutra, Agyan, Dharana, and Jita) Jita refers to a practice that has been passed down through tradition, a practice that has been determined by a great person - a Githarth - after considering the substance, field, time, and emotion. Entering this practice (with its characteristics of use) leads to the ultimate purity of the living being. Just as a soiled garment is purified by alkali, etc., so too is a living being stained with karma purified by atonement and charity according to the Jita practice. Sutra -2
The cause of penance is atonement, and penance is also the cause of restraint and purification. And this restraint and purification are the cause of liberation. That is, twelve types of penance are mentioned for purification through atonement. These penances stop incoming karma and destroy accumulated karma. As a result, the path to liberation is attained. Sutra -3,4
Purity of character is achieved through the purity of knowledge from Samayik to Bindusar. Liberation is attained through purity of character. But one who seeks liberation through purity of character must certainly know atonement, because it is through atonement that purity of character is achieved.
There are ten types of atonement: Alochana, Pratikraman, Ubhay, Vivek, Vyutsarg, Tap, Chhed, Mool, Anvasthapy, and Paranchit. Sutra -5
The practice of restraint that is obligatory, the same yoga (which is now instructed in the remaining verses), the purity of the Chhadmastha who is free from evil thoughts, or the cessation of karma bondage, the non-negligence, that is, Alochana.
(The next 6 to 8 verses describe Alochana atonement.) Sutra -6-7
Going out for the purpose of taking food, etc., or going out of the Ucchaar Bhoomi (land of excretion) or Vihar Bhoomi (land of study, etc.), or going out for the purpose of visiting a Chaitya or paying homage to a Guru, etc., following the proper procedure, all these actions, or any other action, if one has to go out more than ten steps, then if one does not perform Alochana, then one is considered impure or guilty of excess, and by performing Alochana, one becomes pure or free from excess. Sutra -8
If one goes out due to a reason with one's own group or another group, that is, with those who have similar conduct or those who have dissimilar conduct, then purity is achieved through Alochana. If one engages in conduct with those who have similar conduct or others, and if one is guilty of excess, then also (if one meets a Githarth Acharya) purity is achieved through Alochana.
(The next 9 to 12 verses describe Pratikraman atonement.) Sutra -9-12
Negligence in the three types of Gupti or the five types of Samiti, desiring something from the Guru in any way, violating Vinaya, following the ten Samachari, even a little falsehood, theft, or possessiveness, sneezing without covering the mouth, upward movement of air, minor cutting, piercing, or peeling, etc.

##  Agam Sutra 38, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Jitatkalp'

**Consuming unattached karma, engaging in humor and jest, speaking falsehoods, indulging in the four passions of anger, etc., consuming the five senses of sound, etc., slipping in vision, knowledge, conduct, or austerity, and even though not killing while being victorious, if one consumes excessive transgressions due to haste or misuse, then one becomes pure through the Mithya Dushkrut form of Pratikraman. If one commits minor transgressions with affection, fear, sorrow, washing the body, etc., or engages in humor, jest, and falsehoods, even with use or caution, then one should know the Pratikraman atonement. This means that Pratikraman atonement is applicable in all these cases.**

**(Now, the atonement for both is explained in verses 13 to 15.) Sutra-13-15**

**If one commits transgressions related to vows due to confusion, fear, sorrow, adversity, haste, carelessness, or dependence, then both atonement, i.e., Alochana and Pratikraman, are applicable. Repeatedly engaging in actions contrary to restraint through the mind, speech, or body, i.e., evil thinking, evil speech, and evil conduct. Even a virtuous person who has become adept in use may not know these transgressions as daily transgressions, etc. If one commits transgressions of vision, knowledge, and conduct due to the cause or haste, then both atonement is applicable.**

**(Verses 16-17 explain the 'Vivek' atonement.) Sutra-16-17**

**If one accepts food, etc., in the form of a body, an epithet, a bed, etc., according to the Sutra, and believes that it is not pure, or if one performs the purification ritual without transgression, according to the rules, or if one brings it from the first porsi to the fourth porsi due to time, or if one brings it from half a yojana away, or if one accepts it before sunrise or after sunset, or if one believes that the sun did not rise or set after accepting it, or if one accepts food, etc., due to illness, old age, etc., and performs the purification ritual according to the rules, then in all these cases, 'Vivek' atonement is applicable.**

**(Now, the Kausagg atonement is explained.) Sutra-18**

**Kausagg atonement is applicable in walking, coming, going, the purpose of the Sutra, etc., in being careful or faultless, in dreams, etc., in crossing a river by boat, etc.**

**(Kausagg atonement is applicable in eating, drinking, sleeping, sitting, visiting a shrine, being a monk, dwelling, excreting, walking, and in 25 breaths (which people currently call 'Logass' or 'Iriyavah').) Sutra-19**

**(Kausagg atonement is applicable in walking outside the dwelling for 100 steps, in a dream of killing, violence, and in a dream of sexual intercourse for 108 breaths.) Sutra-21**

**(In daily Pratikraman, Kausagg atonement is applicable for 50 breaths initially, then 25-25 breaths, in nightly Pratikraman for 25-25 breaths, in Pavik Pratikraman for 300 breaths, in Chaumasi Pratikraman for 500 breaths, and in Samvatsari for 1008 breaths.)**

**Agam Sutra 38, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Jitkalp'**

**Sutra-22**
Knowing the Kausagg Pratikraman for one Navkar Praman for 40 people.

**Sutra-23-25**
Knowing the Kausagg Pratikraman for 27 breaths for the purpose and objective of the Sutra, and for reading the Sutra (while explaining) for eight breaths (one Navkar Praman).
(Now the verses related to Tapa Pratikraman are being told.)

**Sutra-26**
There are two types of Atichar related to Jnanaachar - from Ogh and from Vibhag. From Vibhag, the order of practice is Uddeshak, Adhyayan, Shruta Skandh, Ang. In that relation, there are eight Atichar - Kal, Vinay, Bahuman, Updhan, Aninhvan, Vyanjan, Arth, Tadubhay. The transgression in these eight Achars is Atichar related to Jnanaachar. In that, for Uddeshak Atichar due to Anagadh reason, there is one Nivi, for Adhyayan Atichar, there is Purimadd, for Shruta Skandh Atichar, there is Ekasana, and for Ang related Atichar, there is Ayambik Tapa Pratikraman. If the reason is Agadh, then for the same fault, there is Tapa Pratikraman up to the eighth Paryant of Purimadd. That Vibhag Pratikraman and from Ogh, for any Sutra, there is Upavas Tapa Pratikraman, and from Arth, for unobtained or inappropriate, there is also Upavas Tapa for giving something like reading.

**Sutra-27**
Do not transgress Kal-Anuyog, do not clean the Sutra, Arth, or food ground, do not give up Vigei, do not sit down on the Sutra-Arth, then there is one Upavas Tapa Pratikraman.

**Sutra-28**
There are two types of Jog - Agadh and Anagadh. Both have two divisions - from Sarv and from Desh. From Sarv means Ayambil, and from Desh means taking Vigei by doing Kausagg. If Ayambil breaks in Agadh Jog, then there are two Upavas, and in Desh Bhang, there is one Upavas. In Anagadh, there are two Upavas in Sarv Bhang and Ayambil Tapa in Desh Bhang.

**Sutra-29-30**
Doubt, desire, Vitigicchha, Moohdristi, Anupabrinhna, Asthiri Karan, Avatasaly, Aprabhavna - these eight Darshan Atichar, if consumed from Desh, meaning in some part, then there is one Upavas Tapa, and for the increase of Mithyatva, there is one Upavas. Such Ogh Pratikraman should be considered, and the Sadhu who consumes these eight divisions from Desh, should know the Pratikraman Tapa as Purimadu for Sadhu, Ratnadhik for Ekasana, Upadhyay for Ayambil, and Acharya for Upavas.

**Sutra-31**
In the same way, for every Sadhu, there is Pratikraman Tapa up to Purimadd, etc., Upavas, for not increasing, strengthening, etc., the Upbrinhna-Samyam. And then, for having Mamtav for Passatha, Avasann-Kushila, etc., due to the help of the family, for taking care of Shravak, etc., or for having Vatsalya, there is Pratikraman Tapa like Nivi-Purimadd, etc. Here, one should have Mamtav, etc., Alamban from all sides with complete freedom from fault, with the intention of making the Sadharmik a Samyami, or for the concern or satisfaction of the Kula Sangha-Gana, etc.

**Sutra-32**
For organizing a Ekendriya Jiva, there is Nivi Tapa. Giving pain to these Jivas or causing trouble with a stronger operation, that is told in two divisions - Anagadh and Agadh. For doing this due to Anagadh reason, there is Purimadd Tapa, and for Agadh reason, there is Ekasana Tapa Pratikraman.

Sutra-33
False speech, non-payment, possession, these three, for those who consume them from substance, field, time or emotion, from the lowest to Ekasana, from the middle to Ayambil, from the highest to one fasting penance. Sutra - 34
If clothes, vessels, vessel-bands etc. are torn, if they are smeared with oil, ghee etc., then one fast, if they are in the presence of sand, harad, medicine etc., then one fast, if they are in the presence of gad, ghee, oil etc., then six, if they are in the presence of others, then three fasting penances.

## Āgama Sūtra 38, Cheda Sūtra-5, 'Jītakalpa'

**Sūtra-56**
The Purimaḍ tapa prāyaścitta is performed while lying down on the 'Jītakalpa'.

**Sūtra-57**
Entering a house for food without the permission of the Ācārya, or engaging in parākrama gopa, requires an ekāsaṇā prāyaścitta. According to the Jīta vyavahāra, if the act is done without māyā, then an ekāsaṇā is required, but if it is done with māyā, then a upavāsa is required.

**Sūtra-58**
Activities like running and jumping have the potential to cause the death of the five senses. Acts like angadāna, śukra niṣkramaṇa, and other complex karmas, consuming food that is half-cooked, and prolonged sexual intercourse, all require a pañcakalyāṇaka prāyaścitta tapa.

**Sūtra-59**
One should not perform paḍilehaṇa during the last part of the first porīsi, or during the pādono porīsi, or during the first and last porīsi. If one performs śuddhi during the cāumāsī or on the Sanvatsarī day, then a pañcakalyāṇaka tapa prāyaścitta is required.

**Sūtra-60**
Those who do not have faith in the cheda (prāyaścitta), who do not know whether their paryaya is chedita or achedita, and who are proud of their paryaya, require a cheda prāyaścitta. This is the Jīta vyavahāra for the gaṇādhipati. If the gaṇādhipati requires a cheda prāyaścitta, then they should perform the appropriate tapa prāyaścitta.

**Sūtra-61**
For those prāyaścitta not mentioned in this Jīta vyavahāra, I will briefly mention them here. They are the ones mentioned in the Nīsiha-vyavahāra-kappa. They should be observed for a period of six months.

**Sūtra-62**
(Here, the term 'sarva bheda' is used to encompass all offenses, while the term 'bhinna' is used to refer to offenses that are different from the general category.) For all offenses mentioned in the Sūtra vyavahāra, the appropriate nīvi tapa should be performed according to the Jīta vyavahāra. Generally, the following prāyaścitta tapas should be performed: Purimaḍ for a laghu māsa, ekāsaṇā for a guru māsa, āyambila for a laghu cāumāsa, upavāsa for a guru cāumāsa, ṣaṭṭha for a laghu ṣaḍ māsa, and aṭṭhama for a guru ṣaḍ māsa.

**Sūtra-63**
In all these cases, the tapas mentioned in the Siddhānta should be followed, and the nīvi to aṭṭhama tapas should be performed according to the Jīta vyavahāra.

**Sūtra-64-67**
Regarding the prāyaścitta mentioned above, it is important to note that all prāyaścitta are categorized as general and specific. They should be observed according to the specific instructions regarding dāna-vibhāga, dravya-kṣetra-kāla-bhāva-puruṣa paḍisevī. This means that one should be aware of the dravya, etc., and give accordingly. One should also consider the amount, whether it is less, more, or moderate, and give according to one's capacity. The prāyaścitta should be given according to the Jīta vyavahāra, considering the food, etc., of the recipient, and the availability of resources in the region. Where food, etc., is scarce, the prāyaścitta should be less. One should also consider the nature of the kṣetra, whether it is rūkṣa, snigdha, or ordinary. In a rūkṣa kṣetra, the prāyaścitta should be less, in an ordinary kṣetra, it should be as mentioned in the Jīta vyavahāra, and in a snigdha kṣetra, it should be more. The prāyaścitta should be performed in all three kālas (seasons) in three different ways. Summer is a rūkṣa kāla, winter is an ordinary kāla, and the rainy season is a snigdha kāla.

**Agam Sutra 38, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Jita Kalpa' is the time.** In summer, the penance should be given in order: least - one fast, medium - sixth, best - eighth. In winter, the penance should be given in order: sixth-eighth, four fasts. In rainy season, the penance should be given in order: eighth-four fasts, five fasts. According to the Sutra's practical advice, there are nine ways of conduct. Sutra-68

Knowing the feelings of the healthy and the sick, give the healthy a little more penance and the sick a little less. Give him as much penance as he is capable of. Just like the feeling of substance-field, consider time also as a target. Sutra-69-72

**Whether a man is a 'Gitarth' or an 'Agitarth', whether he is tolerant or intolerant, whether he is straightforward or deceitful, whether he is a devotee or not, and whether he is an 'Atiparinam' who only follows exceptions, whether he is endowed with 'Dhriti-Sanghaya' and both, whether he is deficient in it, whether he is powerful in penance, whether he is 'Vaiyavacchi', whether he is powerful in both, whether he has no power at all or is of another kind.**  **Achelka etc. are 'Kalpasthit', 'Parinat', 'Kritajogi', 'Taraman' (skillful) or 'Akalpasthit', 'Aparinat', 'Akritajogi' or 'Ataraman', there are two types of men, in the same way, 'Kalpasthit' can also be 'Gachchvasi' or 'Jinkalpi'.**  **Among all these men, give more penance to the one who has more power and qualities, and give less penance to the one who has less power and qualities, and do not give any penance to the one who is completely deficient, consider it as 'Jita Vyavahar'.** Sutra-73

There are many types of sadhus in this 'Jita Vyavahar'. For example, those who commit 'Akritya', 'Agitarth', 'Agnat', for this reason, there are penances from 'Nevi' to 'Aththam' in 'Jita Vyavahar'.
(Now 'Padishevna' is explained.) Sutra-74

**Violence, running, jumping, etc. actions, negligence or the use of 'Kalpa', or those who use 'Dravya', 'Kshetra', 'Kal' according to their feelings (such men are called 'Padishevna' i.e. those who use forbidden things).** Sutra-75

Just as I have said about penance according to 'Jita Vyavahar', should it be given to those who use it with negligence, i.e. those who use forbidden things? In this penance, by using 'Pramad-Sthan', increase it by one place.
Instead of the penance from 'Nevi' to 'Aththam' which is considered acceptable, those who use it with negligence should be given from 'Purimadd' to four fasts (one more penance in order). Sutra-76

Give the one who commits violence one 'Asana' to five fasts or six places or the original penance. If 'Kalpa' is used with effort, i.e. it is used with effort, then give 'Pratikraman' penance or 'Taduphal-Alochana' and 'Pratikraman-Pratikraman' penance. Sutra-77

Even during the time of 'Alochana', if he hides or deceives, then give more penance to that 'Sanklishta Parinam'. If he scolds and insults due to 'Sanveg Parinam', then give less penance knowing his pure feeling. Give the same penance to the 'Madhyam Parinam'. Sutra-78

In the same way, if he appears to have more qualities of 'Dravya-Kshetra-Kal' feeling, then give more penance for the sake of 'Guru Seva'. If he appears to be devoid of 'Dravya-Kshetra-Kal' feeling, then give less penance, and if he appears to be very less, then do not give any penance.

## Āgama Sūtra 38, Chhedasūtra-5, 'Jītakalpa' Sūtra - 79
One who performs other austerities well, more than Jīta conduct, should not be given Jīta conduct penance by giving other penances. If one is a Vaivavacchāri, then a little penance should be given.
(Now it is called Chhed penance.) Sūtra-80
Give Chhed penance to those who are proud of austerity, or are unable to perform austerity, or who have no faith in austerity, or who cannot restrain themselves from austerity, or who are Atiparināmi-Apvāda-sevī, or who have few companions. Sūtra-81-82
Those who are mostly destroyers of Uttaraguṇa, who repeatedly commit Chheyāvatti, i.e., Chhed āvṛtti, who are Pāsaththa, Osanna Kushīla, etc., even those who repeatedly commit Vaivavacch of a Sanvigna Sadhu, who perform six-month austerity in the excellent austerity land, i.e., the rule of Vīra Prabhu, who have remaining Charitra, give them Chhed penance for five, ten, fifteen years, or up to six months, or as many Paryāyas as they have taken.
(Now the Mūla penance is explained.) Sūtra-83
Those who repeatedly commit Prāṇātipāta, the killing of the five senses, sexual intercourse with aversion or pride, Mṛṣāvāda-Adattādāna or Parigraha from the excellent, give them Mūla penance. Sūtra - 84
Those who are proud of austerity, who are unable to perform austerity, who have no faith in austerity, who find fault with or destroy Mūla-Uttaraguṇa, who abandon Darshan and Charitra, or who abandon duties like Darshan, etc., such a Shaiksha (Shaiksha, etc., all) also receives Mūla penance. Sūtra-85-86
Those who are extremely depressed, who commit violence, etc., against a householder or other Tirthika, who take or destroy a woman's womb, such a Sadhu - he has been told to perform austerity, such austerity - Chhed or Mūla, Anvasthāpya or Pāraṃcita penance, if he transgresses it, then Paryāya Chhed, Anvasthāpya, Pāraṃcita austerity should be completed, then he should be established in Mūla penance. In the case of an objection to Mūla, Mūla penance is repeatedly given.
(Now Anvasthāpya penance is explained.) Sūtra - 87
Those who repeatedly have hatred towards the excellent, who steal with their mind, who strike with a terrible result and without impartiality, either for their own side or for the other side, give them Anvasthāpya penance. Sūtra-88
Where Pāraṃcita penance is given for all offenses by doing enough, there the Upādhyāya should be given Anvasthāpya penance, where Anvasthāpya penance is given by doing enough, there also give Anvasthāpya penance. Sūtra - 89
Anvasthāpya is said to be of four kinds: Linga, Kshetra, Kāla, and Tapa, which cannot be established in Vrata or Linga, i.e., Vesh, which seems inappropriate for Pravrajyā, give them Anvasthāpya penance. There are two kinds of Linga: Dravya and Bhāva, Dravyalinga, i.e., Rajoharaṇa, and Bhāvalinga, i.e., Mahāvrat.

## Agam Sutra 38, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Jitkalp' Sutra- 90

For a dravya or bhava lingi who is engaged in harming oneself or others, and for one who is devoid of bhava lingi like osanna, etc., the prescribed penance is Anvasthapy. The penance should be Anvasthapy in the same area where the fault occurred. Sutra- 91

The duration of the Anvasthapy penance should be equal to the duration of the fault. There are two types of Anvasthapy faults: Ashatana and Padishevna-Nishiddha Karma. The Anvasthapy penance for Ashatana is six months for the least severe and one year for the most severe. The Anvasthapy penance for Padishevna is one year for the least severe and twelve years for the most severe. Sutra- 92

If the Anvasthapy penance of twelve years arises due to Padishevna caused by Utsarga, then due to an exception, a lesser or even lesser penance should be given, or it should be completely waived. Sutra- 93

(After performing the Anvasthapy penance) one should also pay respects to the Shaiksha. However, no one should pay respects to him. After performing the penance, he should diligently perform Parihar Tapa. He can live with them, but he should not engage in any interaction or acts of respect, etc. 
(Now, the Pariंचित penance is mentioned.) Sutra- 94

If one has Ashatana towards Tirthankar, Pravachan, Shruta, Acharya, Ganadhar, Mahardhik, etc., due to Abhinivesha-Kadagraha, then Pariंचित penance is prescribed. Sutra- 95

If one, while in their own gender form, repeatedly and openly engages in the service of the king's chief queen, being influenced by Kshaya-Dushta or Vishaya-Dushta and being overpowered by raga, then Pariंचित penance is prescribed. Sutra- 96

If one is afflicted by a great fault due to the arising of Thinaddhi Nidra, is attached to mutual sexual intercourse, and repeatedly engages in the appropriate penance for Pariंचित, then Pariंचित penance is prescribed. Sutra- 97

There are four types of Pariंचित: Ling, Kshetra, Kal, and Tap. Pariंचित penance is prescribed for those who engage in mutual Padishevna and those who are afflicted by Thinaddhi Mahadosha. Sutra- 98-99

For the place of entry into a city, country, or kingdom, such as Vasati, Nivesha, Pado, Vriksh, Rajya, etc., one should perform Pariंचित for the fault committed in that place. Sutra- 100

The duration of the Pariंचित penance should be equal to the duration of the fault. There are two types of Pariंचित: Ashatana and Padishevna. The Ashatana Pariंचित is six months to one year, and the Padishevna Pariंचित is one year to twelve years. Sutra- 101

After performing the Pariंचित penance, one should keep the Maha-Sattvashaali alone, like a Jinkalpi, outside the area, at a distance of half a yojana, and establish him for Tapa. The Acharya should observe him daily.

Āgama Sūtra 38, Chhedasūtra-5, 'Jītakalpa' Sūtra-102
The Anvasthāpya Tapa and Pāraṃcita Tapa, both Prāyaścitta, have been severed from the last fourteen Pūrva-Dhara Āchārya Bhadra-Bāhu Svāmī. The rest of the Prāyaścitta will remain as long as the Śāsana exists. Sūtra - 103
Thus, this Jīta Kalpa-Jīta Vyavahāra has been briefly explained with compassion and wisdom for the benefit of the sādhus. Accordingly, one should give Prāyaścitta with full knowledge of its qualities.
