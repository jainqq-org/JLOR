 PREFACE. This translation was made in 1917 at Indore after I had finished my
translation of Jiva Kanda (Volume Fifth of the Sacred Books of the Jainas). Only
this, Part I, was translated. My official duties, health and many similar
circumstances obstructed both a further translation and an earlier publication.
In this, as in the publication of my other long-lain manuscripts, I am beholden
beyond repayment to my beloved and revered brethren Jaina Dharma Bhushana
Brahmachari Sital Prasadaji and Pandit Ajit Prasada, M.A., LL.B., both of whom
have been doing this labour of love and piety at Lucknow from August 1926. Karma
Kanda, in brief, is a scientific analysis of Evil, of Sin. Evil is material, as
God or the Pure Soul is certainly immaterial. The Jiva Kanda deals primarily
with the Soul ; the Karma Kanda with the material and self-forged Karmic fetters
of this soul. It describes the matter and manner of this bondage, so that true
and accurate knowledge may help the imprisoned, embodied soul to live a life
leading to freedom and Bliss. Indeed the only use of true books-the "Bibles" of
the world-is to teach people how to live. Otherwise they are a "dull and endless
strife", and the over production of books on all subjects and in all countries
may well be called a prostitution of the Press, and distraction and dissipation
of the human intellect. The Press is like the Frankenstein of old, which created
by man, has mastered him to the strangling point. The fiction Magazine with its
teachings of crime and lasciviousness, the daily newspaper with its reports of
divorces, dacoities, and all the dirty details of human defects and aberrations,
are the greatest instruments of the Devil.

 Our costly and artificial systems of Education and Government also seem to be
open to the same objection mostly. Well have the Conquerors of pain and
ignorance (the Jinas) prohibited frivolous talk, jests, pranks, stories of sex,
crime, political gossip, etc., etc., as Pramada (carelessness) leading to
entanglement in Samsara (mundane life), and obscuring the real qualities of the
soul. As it is impossible to improve upon that wonderful gem of Jaina Sacred
Literature, the Jaina Bible, I have purposely quoted at length, in the
Introduction, from Saint Umasvami's Tattvartha Sutra, as it gives the eternal,
patent remedies and procedure for lessening and removing human ills. It is a
very long process to show the application of these remedies to our many and
complex needs of every-day life; and it is obviously impossible to indicate
their application to individual needs. But the remedies are these, and every man
and woman, knowing his or her own faults and frailties, needs and desires, can
easily find guidance after studying these general rules of right human conduct.
The test of the pudding is in the eating thereof; and the test of the value of
these teachings is when a man follows them and finds that they cure his weakness
and sorrow and give him peace, power, calmness, a noble delight in his own work
and life, and joyous co-operation and brotherly service in his relations with
his neighbours and living beings generally. In one word, these teachings instil
into one an insight of his being a chip of the eternal Omniscience and
Omnipotence which we call GOD, and at the same time excite him into an easy,
almost instinctive, realisation of his being a happy member of the Universal
Fraternity of all Living Beings. Whatever is correct in this volume, is due to
the grace of the Tithamkaras and the kindness of my devoted friends at Lucknow ;
but whatever is a mistake in matter and manner is entirely due to my
unworthiness and laziness, i. e., to my Pramada. INDORE, NEW YEAR'S DAY, 1927.

 INTRODUCTION. Gommata-Sara, Karma-Kanda is really a complement of Shri Nemi
Chandra Siddhanta Chakravarti's Jiva Kanda of Gommata Sara. For general remarks
on the whole book, reference may be made to the Introduction to my translation
of Jiva Kanda Volume Fifth of the Sacred Books of the Jainas. Here only Karma
Kanda will be dealt with. The Six Substances. Space and time are co-extensive
and infinite. Space consists of the Universe (Loka), and the Non-Universe
(Aloka). The Universe consists of two substances: Living (Jiva) and non-Living
(Ajiva). The Living alone has consciousness, power to attend and to know. The
non-Living has neither Consciousness, nor Attention, nor Knowledge. This is of 5
kinds: (1) Matter (Pudgala) i. e., table, chair, brick, stone, etc. (2)
Principle of Motion (Dharma) which is an essential auxiliary of the motion of
souls and matter. (3) Principle of Rest (Adharma), which is a similar auxiliary
of the cessation of the movements of souls and matter. (4) Time (Kala), in
virtue of which things become old, new, or continue in their existence. (5)
Space (Akasha), which gives their place or location to all substances. These
six, Jiva, Pudgala, Dharma, Adharma, Kala, and Akasha, are called the six
substances or Dravyas. Dravya. Dravya literally means flowing or continuing. It
is so-called, because it flows or continues the same through all its
modifications. It is called "Sat" or Existence also. Existence or substance is a
collective name for a trinity-unity of Birth (Utpada), Decay (Vyaya) and
continuance (Dhrauvya).

 Attributes (Guna). A Substance further is a group of attributes and
modifications. As there are 6 substances, some attributes are general or common;
others are special. Samanya-guna, or common attributes are found in all
substances; these are the attributes which are necessary for the existence of
the group, as a group or substance. These are infinite but 6 are principal : 1.
Astitva, Is-ness; Indestructibility; permanence; the capacity by which a
substance cannot be destroyed. 2. Vastutva, Functionality; capacity by which a
substance has a function. 3. Dravyatva, Change-ability, capacity by which it is
always changing in modifications. 4 4. Prameyatva, Know-ability: capacity of
being known by someone, or of being the subject-matter of knowledge. 5.
Agurulaghutva, Individuality; capacity by which one attribute or substance does
not become another and the substance does not lose the attributes whose grouping
forms the substance itself. 6. Pradeshatva, Spatiality, capacity of having some
kind of location in space. Chetanatva, Consciousness Amurtatva, Immateriality
Achetanatva, Unconsciousness Amurtatva, Immateriality Achetanatva,
Unconsciousness ... are common attributes of the class of substance, or group of
attributes, called Soul. are common to Space, Motion, Rest and Time. are common
to Matter. Murtatva, Materiality Vishesha guna are special attributes of a
particular substance. These are the attributes which distinguish one group from
the others. Vishesha-guna or special attributes of each substance are:1. Jiva-
Soul 1. Knowledge. In its full form it arises only in the absence of knowledge-
obscuring karma. 2. Conation. In its full form it arises only in the absence of
conation-obscuring karma. 3. Pliss. In its full form it arises only in the
absence of all the 4 destructive karmas, etc. 4. Fower. In its full form it
arises only in the absence of obstructive karmas, etc.

======================
 5. Right Belief In its full form it arises only 6. Right Conduct in the absence
of deluding karma. 7. Avyavadha. Undisturbable, due to the absence of vedaniya
or feeling karma ; neither pleasure nor pain. 8. Avagaha, Penetrability, due to
the absence of age-karma. 9. Agurulaghutva, due to the absence of family-de
termining-karma. 10. Sukshmatva, fineness due to the absence of body making
karma. The first 6 are Anujivi attributes, which co-exist in and constitute the
substance. They arise fully only on the destruction (kshaya) of the 4
destructive (Ghatiya) karmas ; Conation-and-Knowledge-obscuring; Deluding; and
Obstructive. The last 4 are Pratijivi attributes, which merely indicate the
absence of their opposites. They arise fully on the destruction (Kshaya) of the
4 non-destructive (Aghatiya) karmas; Feeling, Age; Family-determining and Body-
making karmas. 2. Pudgala, matter has for its special attributes : 1. Touch ; 2.
Taste; 3. Smell & 4. Colour. 3. Dharma, has for its special attribute the
quality of being the medium of motion. 4. Adharma, medium of rest. 5. Akasha,
Space; its special attribute is to give place to all substances. 6. Kala, Time;
its special attribute is to bring about modifications. Modifications (Paryaya).
Modifications occur only with reference to attributes. This alone is what is
meant by Birth and Decay. Modifications or conditions change : i.e., a new
condition is born, i.e. comes into existence (Utpada), and the old one decays,
i.e. goes out of existence (Vyaya). The essential attributes of the substance
always through all these modifications. It must be clearly understood and

======================
 constantly remembered that substance is one; the birth and decax in its
modification, and the continuance of the Substance itself are only 3 aspects of
viewing one and the same thing. Also Substance (Dravya), Attribute (Guna) and
Modification (Paryaya) are three mutually interpervasive aspects of the one
trinity-unity; Attribute is nothing different from Substance and Modification.
So for all the three. When we talk or think of one, we necessarily talk or think
of the remaining two. The threefold distinction is merely for the purpose of
exposition and explanation by our limited knowledge to others of limited
knowledge. The soul with Omniscience sees the whole trinity-unity in its
entirety at one and the same time. The Embodied Soul. In the Universe, the Jiva
Dravya or Soul is found mixed with non-living matter. Even the most ordinary and
the least civilised men, even animals, exhibit their recognition of this fact.
For Death is a most universal and eternal phenomenon. The living body is ng ;
when death intervenes, the body becomes lifeless, or dies. Life has left the
body. This Life is the Soul : the body represents the grossest and most visible
form of matter, with which the Life was clothed, and which was "Living" only so
long as Life or Soul was united with it. The 7 Tattvas. The Soul (Jiva) and the
Non-Soul (Ajiva) are the first two Tattvas. The most important non-Soul is the
Pud gala Dravya Matter-Substance. The most important combination of soul and
matter is our body. It is also manifest that this body is constantly changing,
in - virtue of our activity of mind, speech and body. A feeling of modesty in
the mind of the maiden paints her cheeks with blush. A sad thought gives one a
long face. Criminal broodings breed a criminal look in a man or woman. The pious
chanting of a hymn or prayer gilds one with the calm detachment and glory of the
halo of a priest or devotee. Our food, dress, play and work, all bring about
constant changes in the body. Matter attracts matter. Generally the law of
nature is "like to like." The matter of bad thoughts attracts matter of bad
thought, and ultimately becomes the father of a bad habit. This attraction of
good or bad matter by the soul in virtue of its mental, vocal, or bodily
activity, is called Inflow (Ashrava). When the attracted matter has actually
become a part of our body, i.e., when it has become bound to the soul as the
body is

 7 already bound to it, it is called Bondage (Bandha). The Persian word bandah
"bound" for man, is literally true in this sense of Jainism. The Christian "Fall
of Man" by the absorption of Sin by man, is a parallel doctrine. If by pious
attention and right conduct, the Inflow is stopped; it is Stoppage (Samvara).
The gradual shedding of the matter already bound is shedding (Nirjara). The
total separation of Soul from the bondage of all matter is Liberation (Moksha).
In brief, Jiva or Soul plus Karma or Matter is what it is now in its embodied,
mundane condition; and the embodied soul minus all matter is what the Soul will
be in its Pure and Liberated condition in Moksha. Matter. This matter (Pudgala)
is of 6 kinds : 1. Gross-gross, or very gross matter (solid), e.g. a mountain, a
pillar of iron, etc. This class of matter when divided, cannot be united without
the use of a third something; 2. Gross (liquid), e.g. water, oil, etc. On
division this can be united without the intervention of a third thing; 4. Gross-
fine, e.g. shade, sunshine. It is interesting to compare this with the
corpuscular theory of light in Western physics, before it was replaced by the
modern wave-theory of Huygens. It is matter which looks gross or tangible, but
cannot be grasped ; 4. Fine-gross, e.g. fragrance, sound, sweetness etc.; the
distinction between this and gross-fine being that gross-fine is more gross than
fine because it can be seen as light, shade, etc.; whereas fine-gross cannot be
seen, although its origin may be gross. The gases of science would be fine-
gross. Fine-gross includes all things that may be perceived by the senses of
touch, taste, smell or sound; 5. Fine, matter capable of becoming karmic matter.
It cannot be perceived by the senses; 6. Fine-fine, matter which has for its
atoms the combination of two or more ultimate atoms (paramanu). According to
some Saints it is the ultimate atom itself. (Vide Jiva Kanda, Gathas 602-3.
Outlines of Jainism, Pages 21-22.) From the molecular point of view, Matter is
of 23 kinds : 1. Atom, anu vargana. 2. Numerable-atoms-molecule, Sankhyatanu-
Vargana.

of all men and animals. 2. Vaikriyika, Fluid, the body of hellish and celestial
beings, which they can change at will. 3. Aharaka, assimilative, the spiritual

mind, of mano Vargana, No. 11; and our karmic body of Karma-vargana, No. 13.
Karmic Matter. Now it is with this last mostly that we deal here.

 Inflow of Karmie Matter. Inflow of Karmic matter towards the soul is caused by
the vibratory activity of mind, speech and body. If the vibratory activity is
with passion, the inflow leads to bondage of soul by karmic matter. It is called
Samparayika or Mundane Inflow. If it is without passion, i. e., purely vibration
in the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth spiritual stages and does not lead to
bondage, it is called fryapatha or transient or fleeting Inflow. 39 kinds of
Inflow. The Mundane Inflow is of 39 kinds, according to its causes: 5. Caused by
the activity of the 5 Senses. 4. 4 Passions; 5. 5 3) 39 97 39 "" 39 " "" .. ""
29 33 39 25. 25 kinds of activity as follow: 1. Samyaktva-kriya, that which
strengthens right belief; e.g., worship, etc. 2. Mithyatva-kriya, that which
strengthens wrong belief, e. g., superstition, etc. 3. Prayoga-kriya, bodily
movement. 4. Samadana-kriya, tendency to neglect vows, after having taken them.
5. Iryapatha-kriya, walking carefully, i.e., looking on the ground for
protecting living beings which may be trod upon and thus injured. 6. Pradoshiki-
kriya, tendency to accuse others in anger. 7. Kayiki-kriya, a wicked man's
readiness to hurt others. 8. Adhikaraniki-kriya, having weapons of hurtfulness.
9. Paritapiki-kriya, anything which may cause mental pain to oneself or others.
.. Sins of Injury, Lies, Theft, Unchastity and Worldly Attachment. 10.
Pranatipatiki-kriya, depriving another of vitalities of age, sense-organs, power
or respiration. 11. Darshana-kriya, infatuated desire to see a pleasing form,

inventing new sense-enjoyments. 14. Samantanupatana-kriya, answering call of
nature in a place frequented by men, women or animals. 15. Anabhoga-kriya,

 10 16. Svahasta-kriya, undertaking to do by one's own hand, what should be done
by others. 17. Nisarga Kriya, admiration of hurtful or unrighteous things. 18,
Vidarana-kriya, proclaiming other's sins. 19. Ajna-vyapadiki-kriya,
misinterpreting the scriptural injunctions, which we do not want to follow, 20.
Anakanksha kriya, disrespect to scriptural injunctions out of vice or laziness.
21. Prarambha-kriya, engaging in harmful activities or expressing delight in
other's misdeeds. 22. Parigrahiki-kriya, trying to persevere in one's attachment
to worldly belongings, 23. Mayakriya, deceitful disturbance of some one's right
knowledge and faith. 24. Mithya-darshana-kriya, praising actions due to wrong
belief. 25. Apratyakhyana-kriya, not renouncing what ought to be renounced. Note
that the Senses, Passions and Vowlessness are the causes and the 25 kinds of
activity are their effects. Differences in Inflow. The differences in inflow in
different souls caused by the same activity arise from differences in the
following: 1. Intensity of desire or thought-activity. 2. Mildness >> >> >> >>
3. Intentional character of the act. 4. Unintentional character of the act. 5.
Dependence of the act upon living and non-living substances or activities. 6.
One's own position and power to do the act. The Dependence (Adhikarana) is of
two kinds, relating to the souls and the non-souls. The first, i. e., dependence
on the souls is of 108 kinds due to differences in the following: 1. Samrambha.
Determination to do a thing. Compare intention for an offence in Criminal Law.
2. Samarambha. Preparation for it, i.e. collecting materials for it. Compare in
Criminal Law the conduct of the criminal before committing the offence.

 11 3. Arambha. Commencement of it Compare Attempt in Criminal Law. These three
can be done by three yogas, i.e., activity of mind, body and speech, thus there
are 3x 3-9 kinds. Each one of the 9 kinds can be done in three ways, i.e. by
doing oneself, or having it done by others, or by approval or acquiescence. Thus
we get 27 kinds. Each one of the 27 may be due to the 4 passions. That gives us
27 x4=108 kinds. Thus the Jaina rosary has 108 beads, one for each of these 108
Jivadhikaranas. These 108 kinds can become of 432 kinds, if we consider each
passion in its 4 aspects of Error-feeding or Right-belief-preventing, partial-
vow-preventing, total-vow-preventing and perfect conduct preventing. The second
kind of dependence relating to the non-soul is of the following 11 kinds. 2
Kinds of Production: (1) Mula Guna, i. e. of the body, speech, mind and
respiration, (2) Uttara gana, i. e. production of books, pictures, statues, etc.
4 kinds of putting down a thing (1) Apratya Vekshita, without seeing, (2) Duh-
pramrishta, petulantly, peevishly, (3) Sahasa, hurriedly and (4) Anabhoga, where
it ought not to be put. 2 kinds of mixing up (1) Bhakta-pana, food and drink,
(2) Upakarana, mixing up of things necessary for doing any act. 3 kinds of
movement by (1) Kaya, body, (2) Vang, speech, (3) Mana, mind. Inflow of the
Eight Karmas. I-II-KNOWLEDGE AND CONATION-OBSCURING. The inflow of knowledge and
conation-obscuring karmic matter, is caused by the following: 1. Depreciation of
those who are learned in the scriptures. 2, Concealment of knowledge. 3. Envy;
jealousy. Refusal to impart knowledge out of envy. 4. Obstruction. Hindering the
progress of knowledge. 5, Denying the truth proclaimed by another, by body and
speech. 6. Refuting the truth, although it is known to be such.

 12 III.- Feeling. The inflow ef pain-bringing-feeling (Asata-vedaniya) karmic
matter is due to the following feelings and acts : 1. Dukha, pain. 2. Shoka,
sorrow. 3. Tapa, repentance, remorse. 4. Akrandana, weeping. 5. Badha, depriving
of vitality. 6. Paridevana, piteous or pathetic moaning to attract compassion.
These 6 can be produced in one's own self, in another, or both in one's self and
another. Thus there are 18 forms of this inflow. 1. Bhuta-anukampa, compassion
for all living beings. 2. Vratyanukampa, compassion for the vowers, 3. Dana,
Charity, 4. Saraga-samyama, self-control with slight attachment; etc., 5.
Samyam-asamyama, restraint by vows of some, but not of others, 6. A kama-
niriara, equanimous submission to the fruition of karma, 7. Bala tapa,
austerities not based upon right knowledge, 8. Yoga, contemplation, 9. Kshanti,
forgiveness, and 10. Shaucha, contentment, these are the causes of inflow of
pleasure-bearing feeling karmic matter, (Sata-vendaniya). IV.-Deluding. The
inflow of Darshana mohaniya, right-belief-deluding karmic matter is caused by
Avarnavada, defaming the Omniscient Lord. Arhat Kevali ; the Scriptures, Shruta
; the Saints' brotherhoods, Sangha : the true Religion, Dharma ; and the
Celestial beings. Deva, e, g. saying that the celestial beings take meat or
wine, etc. and to offer these as sacrifices to them. The inflow of right-
conduct-deluding karmic matter is caused by the intense thought-activity
produced by the rise of the passions and of the quasi-passion, no kashaya. E.g.
Joking about Truth, etc., disinclination to take vows, etc. including in evil
society, etc. V.-Age, As the age-karma, the inflow of Narakayu karma, hellish
age karma is caused by too much wordly activity and by attachment to too many
worldly objects or by too much attachment. B.a. committing breaches of the first
five vows of non-killing, truth, non-stealing, chastity, non-attachment to
wordly possessions. The point to be noted is that it is not the possession or
ownership of wordly wealth which is sinful but it is the attachment to it which
is a sin. Aman may be in the world ; but he must not be of it.

 The inflow of Tiryancha-ayu, sub-human age karma is caused by Maya, deceit. 13
E.g. cheating others, preaching the false doctrines, etc. The inflow of
Manushya-Ayu, human-age-karma, is caused by slight wordly activity and by
attachment to a few worldly objects or by slight attachment. Natural humble
disposition is also the cause of human-age karma. Vowlessness and sub-
vowlessness with slight worldly activity and slight attachment, are causes of
the inflow of all kinds of agekarmas. Not taking the vows of laymen and not
adopting the restrictions (shila), but having slight attachment to the world and
activity in it, can be the cause of the inflow of age-karmic matter of all four
kinds. The inflow of Deva-Ayu celestial-age-karma is caused by : 1. Saraga-
samyama, self-control with slight attachment found in monks only. 2.
Samyamasamyama, restraint of some vows, but not of others, found in laymen only.
3. Akama-nirjara, equanimous submission to the fruition of karma. 4. Balatapa,
austerities not based upon right knowledge. Right-belief is also the cause of
celestial-age karma, but only of the heavenly order. It applies to human and
sub-human beings only. A celestial or hellish right-believer binds the human-
agekarma. Note also that if a human or sub-human being has bound a particular
age-karma before gaining right belief, he must enjoy that. (See Jiva Kanda,
Gathas 292, 527, 645). VI. Body making. The inflow of Ashubha-nama, a bad-body-
making karma is caused by a non-straightforward or deceitful working of the
mind, body or speech or by Visamvada, wrangling, etc., wrong-belief, back-
biting, self-praise, censuring others, etc. envy, The inflow of good-body-making
karma is caused by the causes which are opposite of the above viz. by
straightforward dealings with body, mind and speech; by avoiding disputes, etc.,
rightbelief, humility, admiring praiseworthy people, etc.

 Even one of these, if properly contemplated and with rightbelief, brings about
the inflow of Tirthankara-body making-karma. VII.-Family-determining. 15 The
inflow of low-family-determining karma is caused by: 1. Paraninda, speaking ill
of others; 2. Atma prashansa, praising oneself; 3. Sad gunochchhadana,
concealing the good qualities of others; and 4. Asad guna udbhavana, proclaiming
in oneself the good qualities which one does not possess. The inflow of the
next, i. e., high family-determining karma is caused by the opposites of the
above, i. e., 1. Para prashansa, praising others; 2. Atma ninda, denouncing
one's self; 3. Parsad gunaudbhavana, proclaiming the good qualities of others;
4. Atmasad-guna uchchhadana, not proclaiming one's own good qualities; 5.
Nichaih Vritti, an attitude of humility towards one's betters, and 6. Anutseka,
not being proud of one's own achievement or attainments. VIII-Obstructive. The
inflow of obstructive (Antaraya) karma is caused by disturbing others in
charity; gain; enjoyment of consumable things; enjoyment of non-consumable
things and making use of their powers. Note. The inflow of 7 karmas, i. e., of
all except the age-karma, is going on always, in souls influenced by the
Passions, and of the age-karma also on special occasions; but the predominance
of the above causes will determine the intensity of fruition (anubhaga) of their
particular inflow. The special occasions of age-karma are 8 in one man's life,
as follows:-Supposing a man's life is to be 81 years long. The first occasion
for binding the age-karma will be on his passing 2/3 of it, i. e., when he is
54. The second on his passing 23 of the remainder, i. e., when he is 72. The
third on his passing 28 of the remainder, i. e., when he is 78. The fourth on
his passing 2/3 of the remainder again, i. e., when he is 80. Similarly the
fifth when he is 80 years, 8 months. The sixth at 80 years, 10 months and 20
days. The seventh at 30 years, 11 months, 16 days and 16 hours.

 16 The eighth at 80 years, 11 months, 25 days, 13 hours, and 20 minutes If no
age-karma is bound yet, the ninth is the last antar-nauhurta of his life. The
point is that the man is born with his particular age-karma already bound.
Therefore he must bind the age karma of his next incarnation at the latest at
the last moment. BONDAGE - Causes of Bondage. The causes of Bandha or bondage
are : 1. Wrong-Belief. Mithyadarshana, wrong-belief, is of 5 kinds. 1. Ekanta.
Taking only one aspect of a many-sided thing e. g., man is mortal and immortal,
regarded from the point of view of body and soul respectively. Taking only one
view is Ekanta. 2. Viparita. Perverse belief, e.g , Animal sacrifices lead to
heaven. Injury to anyone cannot be a cause of merit. 3. Samshaya-Doubt,
scepticism, hesitation, e.g., as to path of Liberation. 4. Vinaya. Veneration.
Taking all religions and gods, even the so-called religions which enjoin cruel
or immoral practices, to be equally worthy of pursuit. 5. Ajnana. Wrong belief
caused by ignorance. Indiscrimination of good and bad. Wrong belief is caused by
Nisarga, inborn error; or by Adhigama, preaching of another. The last is of 4
kinds: - Kriyavadi, belief in time, soul, etc. as causing everything in the
world. All the substances perform their functions and become causes of different
effects. To uphold otherwise is wrong belief. Akriya vadi, opposite of the last,
e. g., the soul does nothing. This undermines all truth. If the soul does
nothing, who is responsible for the doing and fruition of our good and bad
actions ? Ajnanika, Agnostic. -Everything is not knownable. This is one of the
general attributes of all substances How then can it be said that nothing is
knowable? It may be unknowable from some point of view ; but that is all
Vaineyika, Religion is identical with veneration of parents, king, etc., e. g.,
Confucianism. Obviously veneration and eternal truth are not identical. All
these four together form 363 varieties of wrong belief i, e., 180, 84,67 and 32
respectively.

(For details of yoga, see Jiva Kanda Chapter IX Gathas 216 et seqq.) Karmic
matter is bound to the soul by the Vibrations (yoga) of mind, speech and body,
coloured by Passions (Kashaya) of Anger, Pride, Deceit, and Greed mainly. The
vibrations determine the kind (Prakriti) and the quantity (Pradesha) of the
Karmic matter to be drawn towards and bound to the soul. The Passions determine
the duration (Sthiti)of the bondage, and the mild or intense fruition (Anubhaga
of the karma at its maturity. Kinds of Bondage, There are 8 kinds of Prakritis
of Karmic matter: 1. Jnana varana, Knowledge-obscuring, 2. Darshanavarana,

 25 Of these, 1, 5, 9, 13, and 15 are represented by the 5 (Nos. 58 to 62).
Therefore if the remaining 10 sub-classes are added, we get 97 + 10 - 107 or 148
+ 10 - 158 total sub-classes. III. The 20 sub-classes (Nos. 89 to 108), i. e.,
of touch (8), taste (5), smell (2), and colour (5) may be associated with merit
(punya) or demerit (papa). This division will add 20 to the totals. Thus the
total will be 168. Thus considering the important Body-making Karma in the above
different ways, we get the total of sub-classes of all karmas as 97, 107, 148,
158 or 168. But mainly in all Jaina books only the total of 148 is considered
for all purposes. The Quantity of Bondage. As to Pradesha, according to the
nature caused by their names, from all round, due to the differences in the
vibrations (Yoga) in the soul-activity, not perceptible by the senses, the
karmic molecules enter and become one and stay with every Pradesha of the soul.
They come in infinite numbers, every moment, to each soul. The particular number
of the molecules actually absorbed is called pradesha-bandha. Duration of
Bondage. As to Duration, the maximum duration of the 3 from the first, i.e.,
Knowledge-obscuring, Conation-obscuring and Feeling karmas, and of Obstructive
karmas, is 30 crore x crore Sagaras. This is possible in a rational 5-sensed,
fully developable (paryapta) soul, who has wrong belief (Mithyatva). The maximum
duration of Deluding-karma is :- 70 crore x crore Sagaras. The maximum duration
of Nama, Body-making and Gotra, Family-determining, karmas is 20 crore X crore
Sagaras for each. This is also possible as above. The maximum duration of Syu,
Age karma is 33 Sagaras. The minimum duration of Vedaniya, Feeling karma is 12
Mu. hurtas - 12 x 48 minutes - - 9 hours 36 minutes. That of Nama, Body-making
and Gotra, Family-determining is 8 Muhurtas.

 26 Of all the rest, the minimum is one Antar-muhurta, which ranges from, 1
Samaya and 1 avali at the lowest to 48 minutes minus one Samaya. Fruition of
Karma. As to Fruition, it is according to the name of the karma, e.g.,
knowledge-obscuring karma prevents the acquisition of knowledge and so on.
Stopping of Inflow. Samvara is the stoppage of inflow of karmic matter into the
soul. The causes of Inflow and Bondage are given above. Wrong belief (Mithya
darshana) is stopped (Samvara) in the 4th spiritual stage (Guna sthana);
Vowlessness (Avirata) in the 5th and 6th ; Carelessness (Pramada) in the 7th ;
Passion (Kashaya) in the 8th, 9th and 10th; Vibration (Yoga) in the 14th stage.
For the 14 Spiritual Stages see below :Samvara or Stoppage of Inflow is produced
by : 3 kinds of Gupti, Preservation. 5 ,, ,, Samiti, Carefulness. 10 ,, ,,,
Dharma, Observances ; (Dharma). Anupreksha, Meditation. 22, ,, Parishaha-jaya,

kinds of Right-conduct are :1. Equanimity. 2. Recovery of equanimity after a

in a man of 38 years, who has served the Tirthankara for 8 years, i.e. from the
age of 30 to that of 38). He must have read the Pratyakhyanapurva. (See Jiva
Kanda Gathas 471-2). Shedding of Karmic Matter. Nirjara means the falling away
of karmic matter from the soul. The fetters may by themselves gradually wear out
and leave the soul free: but it is a long process. Therefore a shorter method is
adopted; deliberate activity may hasten the ripening of a karma and the shedding
of its matter. To illustrate : we wish evil to our neighbour A; the thought-
activity invites the-karmic matter into the soul (asrava), the matter comes and
binds the soul (bandha). This karma may take two months to bear its full fruits
; in the meantime it is an evil load for the soul. To gain lightness and to get
rid of the karma, the soul may deliberately feel an oppozite kind of feeling
towards other neighbours B, C, and D, or towards A himself. A still surer way is
to practise austerity. By removing the mind from the demands and impulses of the
body, and by mortifying the physical man through not listening to its greed and
temptations, matter may be overcome and soul freed from the bondage. The natural
maturing of a karma and its separation from the soul is called savipaka-nirjara.
Inducing a karma to leave the soul by means of a contrary karma, or by means of
ascetic practices, is called avipaka nirjara (riddance without fruition). The
terminology of the distinction is derived from botany. A seed grows into a
fruit. It may ripen by itself (savipaka); or it

 30 may be plucked half-ripe, or even unripe, and then ripened by artificial
means. The causes of stopping of inflow of Karmic matter given above (pages
26-7) are also causes of the shedding of the karmas already bound to the soul.
In addition to these, austerities (tapa) also cause the shedding before its
time. Tapa, austerities are external and internal. External austerities are: 1
Anashana, Fasting. 2. Avamodarya, Eating less than one's fill, or less than one
has appetite for. 3. Vritti-parisankhyana, Taking a mental vow to accept food
from a house-holder, only if a certain condition is fulfilled, without letting
any one know about the vow. 4. Rasa parityaga, Daily renunciation of one or more
of 6 kinds of delicacies, viz. : 1. Ghee (Butter, clarified butter). 2. Milk. 3.
Curd. 4. Sugar. 5. Salt. 6. Oil. 5. Vivikta-shayyasana, sitting and sleeping in
a lonely place, devoid of animate beings. 6. Kaya klesha, Mortification of the

devoid of consciousness and has none of the special attributes of Soul.

 31 Mind is matter. Karmas are matter. Pleasure and pain are matter. Prosperity
and adversity are matter, as being the pleasure and pain feeling karma, due to
the presence or absence of some kind of matter. The Saint Shri Kunda Kunda says
in Panchastikaya Gatha 82: "Things enjoyable by the senses, the five senses
themselves, the bodies (including the five kinds of bodies, the mind, the
Karmas, and the other material objects-all this know as matter (pudgala)." All
matter is visible, even karmic matter, though not to our physical eye. Certainly
mental matter is visible directly to mental knowledge. The inflow and bondage of
Karmic matter being the essential causes of all pain and pleasure, it is
possible in the light of Jainism to try to find out, what kind of Karma is the
cause of a particular kind of pain or failure, and how the inflow of that karma
is stopped and how, if it is already bound, it can be shed. If this is done even
roughly and approximately, the study of Karmas becomes of immense and intense
practical value. Also with caution and patience, it can be tested by and made a
subject of, experiments. Perhaps some day in the hands of some lucky scientist,
its results may be proved by science, like. The life, etc., in plants, which
given as an axiom in Jaina books is proved by Sir Jagdis Chander Bose, only
recently scientifically. Soul moulds matter. Every pain and adversity can be
treated scientifically and surely in accordance with the Karma Philosophy of
Jainism. Hence the necessity of studying the Jaina Karma Philosophy. It is not
merely interesting as being of a curious character and great antiquity. It is
not important only for the study of the History and evolution of some most
important aspects of Philosophy and Religion generally, and particularly of
Hindu and Jaina origin. It becomes essential (if it is found to be true) for the
diagnosis and cure of, and prescription for our individual, social, moral,
economic, political, and religious doubts, difficulties, deficiencies, disputes,
troubles, and ailments. The causes and processes of mundane ailments are
adumbrated above. Their remedies, as suggested by Jainism for the last 3,000
years at least, must be of interest and guidance. They are the Eleven stages
(Pratimas) of the Householder's Life; and the vows, common to the Householder
and the Monk, but followed in a more extended and intensive way by the latter.

infatuation (Raga), and hatred (Dvesha) in the pleasing and displeasing worldly
objects of the five senses. The destructive or dangerous and censurable
character of the - 5 faults, injury, etc. in this as also in the next world,
ought to be meditated upon. One must also meditate, that the five faults,

all living beings (Sattveshu). 2. Pramoda, Delight at the sight of beings,

is transitory and not fit for love; and the body is impure and hampering in
spiritual progress and therefore should be subordinated to the soul. Definitions

 3. Abhaya, Re-assuring the frightened, or removing their cause of fear. 4.
Vidya, Knowledge. The 14 Stages, and 148 Karmas. The 14 Spiritual Stages are: 1.
Mithyatva, Wrong belief. Delusion. The thought-activity of the soul due to the
operation of the right belief-deluding karmas. In this, the soul does not
believe in the right path to Liberation. From the first, i.e., this Guna sthana,
the soul goes to the 4th Gunasthana always. 2. Sasadana. Downfall. When there is
operation in the 4th stage of one of the 4 Anantanubandhi kashayas, Error-
feeding passions, the soul falls down to the first stage through the second a
the thought-activity in the passage through, is called Sasadana. 3. Mishra,
mixed. Operation of Samyak-mithyatva-mohaniya karmas or Mishra Mohaniya. Belief
in right and wrong at one and the same time. This is reached always on falling
down from the fourth stage. 4. Avirata-samyaktva. Vowless right-belief. Belief
is produced by the Upashma, subsidence of the 4 Anant anubandhi kashavas. Error-
feeding passions and one or three kinds of right-belief. deluding karmas
respectively, i. e., one for a soul who has never been. or three, for a soul who
has been in possession of Samaktva, right belief. The soul here has belief in
the path of Liberation, but cannot observe the rules of conduct for attaining
Liberation. Three kinds of thought activity may be noted in this stage: 1.
Upashama-samyakta is attained by the Upashama, Subsidence of 5 or 7 kinds of
deluding karmas. 2. Kshayika samyakta is attained by the destruction of the 7
prakrities. 3. Kshayopashama samyakta is attained by the destruc tion or
subsidence of 6, and the continuous operation of the 7th, ie. Samyak-prakrti-
mithyatva, right-beliefclouded-occasionally-by-the-slightest wrong belief. This
kind of thought activity is characterised by 3 defects; i.e.:1. Chala, the
defect of being shaken in his right belief, e. g. thinking that, worship of
Shantinatha will bring calmness ; or that of Parsvanatha will remove obstacles,
etc., etc., whereas all Arhats are the same.

 42 2. Mala, the defect of having the thought-activity soiled by one or more of
the defects or transgressions, e. g., Shanka, doubt; Kanksha, desire of sense
pleasures; Vichikitsa, hatred of the sick and deformed, etc.; Anya-drishti-
prashansa. Thinking admiringly of wrong believers; and Anya-dirishti-samstava,
Praising wrong believers. 3. Agadha, the defect of losing firm hold of right
belief, e. g., dedicating a temple and still thinking it to be one's own
property. 5. Desha virata, Partial vows, i.e. taking the Partial vows. All the
11 Pratimas or stages of a layman's life come in this stage. These are given
supra, page 6. Pramata virata, imperfect vows, after renunciation of all wordly
objects, still occasionally to turn the mind to the service or needs of the
body. This is, pramattabhava, careless, slackness in concentration. Henceforth
the stages are all in the life of a Muni, " Saint. 7. Apramatta virata. Perfect
vows, Renouncing the careless, slackness of the 6th gunasthana, and being
absorbed in spiritual contemplation (Righteous concentration of the highest
type). From here, there are 2 Shrenis, or ways of ascent; 1. Upashama shreni in
which the right-conduct-deluding karma subsides; 2. Kshapaka-shreni, in which it
is being destroyed. This last is the necessary way to Moksha, Liberation. 8.
Apurva karana, new-thought-activity, Karana or thoughtactivity which the saint's
soul had never yet acquired. This is the beginning of the first Shukladhyana,
pure concentration on the pure, Atma or self. 9. Anivritta-karana. advanced
thought-activity, special thought activity of a still greater purity. A stage of
Prathama Shukladhyana. 10. Suksma-samparaya, slightest delusion. All passions
are destroyed or have subsided, except very slight nominal greed, this is also
first Shukladhyana. 11. Upa shanta-moha or Upa-shanta-kashaya, subsided
delusion. A thought-activity which is produced by the subsidence of the entire
right-conduct-deluding karmas. This is also first Shukladhyana. A saint must
fall down from here, but if strong enough, he can resume his ascent from the
Kshapaka mode of ascent in the 8th stage.

 43 12. Kshina moha, delusionless. The entire right-conduct-deluding karmas are
destroyed, in this stage, and the thoughtactivity produced belongs to the 2nd
Shukladhyana. The saint attaining this, does so directly from the 10th stage
without passing through the 11th stage. 13. Sayoga kevali, Vibrating-Perfect
soul. Before commencing this, the soul must have destroyed the three remaining
destructive karmas knowledge-obscuring, conation-obscuring and obstructive
karmas. Here the soul becomes Arhat or Perfect soul in human body with
vibrations in it. Preaching and Peregrinations belong to this stage. 14. Ayoga-
kevali, vibrationless perfect soul. This is attained when there is before the
sayoga kevali's Liberation, just enough time to speak out the 5 letters a I u R
lR . In this stage-a very brief one indeed-the vibrations of the holy body
cease, and the soul attaining Peace and Bliss, becomes one with itself and
leaving the body is called SIDDHA. Now let us see from what particular kind of
the 148 karmas the soul is freed in each stage. This can be caught at a glance
from the following table :

 = 45 (1) The total number of Sub-classes is 148. Of these there are 26 sub-
classes which are included in some others of which they are a sort of
inseparable accident, and therefore really only 122 distinct sub-classes can
come into action at a time. The 26 are as follows: The body (Sharira) karma is
of 5 kinds: Physical, Fluid, Assimilative, Electric, and Karmic. The molecular
bondage (Bandhana) and interfusion (Samghata) is of 5 kinds each. But the
bondage and the fusion are entirely dependant on and associated with the 5
bodies. Therefore these 10 may be considered as nondistinct (Avina-bhavi). The
touch, taste, smell, and colour sub-classes are respectively 8, 5, 2, and 5 in
number. But each class has a distinct activity, i. e., there are only 4 distinct
sub-classes from this view point. Thus 16, may be considered as non distinct.
Deducting the above 10 and 16, i. e. 26 from 148, we get 122 sub-classes. Out of
these 122 distinct sub classes 2, i.e. Clouded-Right-Belief and Mixed-Right-and-
Wrong Belief sub-classes cannot be bound in the first stage of wrong belief,
where the soul has and can have the bondage by the Wrong Belief Deluding Karma
alone. Thus the number of bindable sub classes becomes 120. But the soul in this
stage cannot possibly have bondage of Sharira or an Aharaka Assimilative-body;
Aharaka- Angopanga or Assimilative limbs and minor limbs; nor the Tirthankara-
body-making-Karma. Deducting these three from the 120, we get 117 as the total
number of bindable Karmas in this stage. (2) The Hellish and Sub-human Age have
had their bondageseparation (Bandha Vyuchchhitti) at the end of the first and
second stage respectively. But in this stage no agekarma is ever bound;
therefore the Human and Celestial Age Sub-classes also must be excluded. At the
end of the second stage we had 101-25-76 bindable subclasses. Deducting the 2
from this 76 we get 74. (3) In this stage the human, and Celestial Age and the
Tirthankara-body sub-classes can also be bound. Therefore to the above 74 these
3 must be added, making the bindable sub-classes 77. (4) The Aharaka Sharira or
Assimilative body and the Aharaka Angopanga or Assimilative limbs and minor
limbs sub-classes are bound only here, therefore (63-6)- 57 plus these 2-59 is
the bindable total here.

 (5) At the end of this stage there is the bondage separation of the following
16 sub-classes : (1) Mithyatva, Wrong Belief. (2) Napunsaka veda, Common sex

onwards, leaves behind him the liability to be bound by these 16 sub-classes. In
the next stage the total number of his bindable sub-classes is is 117-16 = 101.
(6) The following 25 sub-classes cease to be bindable after this stage. (1)

the number of operable sub-classes was 111-9-102. There is no transmigration in
this stage, therefore the 4 migratory sub-classes must be deducted from it. But
as the Hellish migratary subclass has already ceased at the end of the first
stage, therefore only 3 are to be deducted, leaving 99-(102-3).

The union of soul and matter is self-proved. This is the first point from which
Jainism starts. This corresponds to the mighty and pregnant division of all
things into Jiva and Ajiva, i. e., living and non-living, or soul and non-soul.
Soul always, and soul

 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. alone, has consciousness. It alone is living,
i. e., is Jiva. All else is non-soul, non-living, devoid of consciousness, which
never had and never shall have consciousness, and is incapable of being
conscious. Everything that is not Jiva is without consciousness. Pure soul is
pure consciousness. Pure non-soul is without consciousness, or without any
semblance of consciousness. This is not a merely logical division, convenient
for analysis, arrangement or exposition. It is a basic fact. It must be
thoroughly understood. Any error or doubt about this will certainly vitiate
one's understanding of Truth. The duality of a human being is obvious. My nails
are different from my idea of Shakespeare, or my ambition of being a worthy
citizen of my country. The nail detached from me is dead matter. Not so the idea
of Poetry or Patriotism. A still finer observation may be made. Life means a
grouping together of so many vitalities, e. o. those faculties which enable me
to apprehend objects by means of my senses, or to sense my own powers of body,
speech and mind, or my respiration. These vitalities exist in me, but not in
dead matter. Every fact in life, to the truly observant soul, cries out in a
most unmistakeable tone the message of this inherent and inevitable mundane
duality. There is Life. There is Lifelessness. We see it in every thing. We see
it around us. We see it in us. It is only the man imbued with a philosophy, in
the phrase of Hume, "subversive of all speculation", who blinds himself to the
obvious existence of these two facts, or who by looking too long and too
intently and exclusively only upon one of these, thinks fit to apotheosize the
one and to deny the other. Of this one-sided lattitude are born the pure
materialists and the pure spiritualists, typified by the Charvakas and the
Vedantists of India respectively. For one, all is matter; for the other, all is
soul. Thus at the very outset, Jainism sounds a clarion note of dissent from
these one ews of Truth. It takes its stand on the plurality of the aspects of
Truth, and teaches us that both the materialists and the spiritualists are
correct, but only partially. Certainly ; there is matter, there is Ajiva ; thus
Charvaka is right and the Vedantist wrong. There is also Spirit, there is Jiva;
thus Vedantism is true, and Charvaka wrong. We must see both, as both are
obvious. Take only one broad common phenomenon of death. John dies. The whole of
John does not disappear. His body is there. His vitality is not. He is not
there; he has gone from the body. That he' who has gone from the body and who
when he was with it and in it, made it alive', is the true John, the Jiva who
was called John, according to Jainism. The body which he wore and which

 GOMMATASARA. he dropped or left on death is the other partner in the firm of
soul and matter; it is Ajiva. And still though the fact of this duality, this
universal union of Jiva and Ajiva is obvious, yet its full grasp and thorough
comprehension are far from easy. A beautiful little book by the author of
Gommatasara himself gives us as clear a notion of Jiva, as any can be obtained
in the peculiar and natural circumstances of things. The reader is referred to
Dravya samgraha*, where in Gatha 2, the 9 chief characteristics of the soul are
enumerated, and each of them elaborated in the succeeding Gathas. But here the
point to be realised clearly is this, that matter -one of the 5 chief forms of
Ajiva-is in union with soul, the only living and conscious substance. Lifeless
matter is found united with living soul. The whole Drama of life is played or
danced together by the living soul being in close grasp of lifeless matter.
Lifeless space is the stage ; Lifeless Time is the duration; and lifeless Dharma
and Adharma, the indespensable assistants for the dancers to move or to rest.
The exercise of dancing is their eternal movement in the cycle of mundane
existences. At each step, the momentum for a new movement is gained. At each
embrace of matter, the delighted deluded soul throbs and vibrates for a fresh
embrace. Wily matter is ever ready to attack the soul and to flow into it with
its million insinuations and to keep alive and vigorous the bondage of the
living by the non-liying. The inflow of the non-living matter into the living
soul is called Asrava; the bondage is Bandha. The stoppage of Asrava is Samvara
; the release of bondage is Nirjara; the total Liberation of the living from the
bondage of the non-living is Moksha. The 7 Tattvas or Principles of Jainism are
treated in Umasvami's Tattvartha Sutrat, to which the reader is referred for
further information about them. The activity of the soul which invites and
enables matter to flow into it, as also the matter which actually does flow into
the soul, is technically called Karma, The thought activity is Bhava-Karma ; the
actual matter flowing into the soul and binding it is Dravya-Karma. This bookthe
Karma-Kanda of Gommatasara deals with Karmas, their incidence, kinds, etc,
Notice also that in the world, all souls are always found united with matter.
Pure souls abide only in Siddhakshetra, the Abode of the Liberated. In universal
space, souls are from eternity subject to the bondage of matter. The
Panchastikaya of Shri Kunda Kundacharya, talking of such souls, tells us in
Gatha 27 : See Dravya Samgraha (1917) by S. C. Ghoshal, M. A., Sacred Books of
the Jainas, Vol. I. See Tattvarthadhigma Sutra, S. B. J., Vol. II by Jaini.

combined with Karmas. This bondage of Karmas is from eternity, but when once it
is broken and Liberation attained, then it is destroyed totally and for ever. Of
course the matter of the bondage is freely and constantly being changed; but the
fact and condition of the bondage of Jiva by Ajiva persist through all these
changes. Old Karmic matter is shed ; and new assumed; but there never has been a
moment when the mundane soul was free from its vestment of Karmic matter.

operation of the body sub-class of bodymaking Karma the soul attracts Karmic and
quasi-Karmic (physical molecules) every instant to the whole body as a hot iron
ball (draws in) water (from all sides). Commentary. The soul united with the
body, is constantly taking in material molecules to renew and build its Karmic
and two other bodies. Karmic molecules build up the Karmic body; and the
physical molecules build up the other physical bodies. In all there are 5
possible bodies of a mundane soul (1) Audarika, the external physical body, (2)
Vaikriyika, fluid body of the celestial and hellish beings, (3) Aharaka, the
assimilative body in which a saint's soul flashes to an omniscient to resolve
some doubt, (4) Taijasa, electric body, (5) Karmana, Karmic body. These are all
material. The molecules of which they are formed are of 2 kinds. (1) Karma-
vargana of which the Karmic body is made. (2) No-karma-vargana, of which the
other bodies are made. The no-karma vargana is of 2 kinds,* Taijasa vargana, of
which the electric body is formed ; and the Aharaka vargana, of which the
external physical, fluid and aharaka bodies are made. Every embodied soul has at
least 3 bodies, the Karmic, the electric and either * 23 kinds of matter vargans
are mentioned in Gommatagara, Jiva Kanda gatha 694 595, pages 294295.

one antar-muhurta, when the Aharaka body emanates from a saint in doubt. And in
transmigration, i. e., its passage from one to another condition of existence,
the soul has only 2 bodies i.e., the Karmic and the electric. All these bodies
are in form like the external body occupied by the soul; they are all co-
extensive. Except that the Aharaka body is human in form but in size of a length
equal to the forearm of the saint himself, i. e., from the elbow to the tip of
his middle finger. The fluid body also, although it is changeable at will, is
yet one to begin with, and its identity persists throughout life.

the soul's vibratory activity (intense or mild). But (the number of molecules
is) unequal; (i.e., sometimes more and at other less are bound). Commentary.
Instant-bondage, Samaya Prabaddha, is the number of Karmic or no-Karmic
molecules bound by the soul in one instant. Henceforth we call it the unit of

number of terms of a series, the sum of which is the number of molecules of a
unit of Bondage, (M. U. B.) and each term in which is half of the term
immediately preceding it. Gunahani-a-yama, (G. A.) is the number of instants
(Samayas) in one Gunahani. aayuga nana gunahanis is the group of gunahanis in
one Unit of Bondage. Anyonya-bhyasta-rashi-2 raised to the power of the number
of gunahanis in one Unit of Bondage. Duration of Bondage (S). Thus gunahani-
ayama number of gunahanis. E.g. If 48 samayas is the duration of Units of
Bondage, and 6 is the number of gunahanis, then gunahani-ayama-48-8. Here nana-
gunahani-the group of 6 gunahanis. Anyonya bhyastarashi here-26-64. This minus
one, being the divisor of the number of a Unit of Bondage gives us the last term
of the series. E.g. If a Unit of Bondage have 6300 molecules, then the last 6300
term is 64-1 -100. Thus the series of 6 gunahanis here is. 3200+ 1600 + 800+
400+200+ 100-6300. In the example given above, the soul which binds in one
instant 6300 molecules, of a duration of 48 samayas and of 6 gunahanis, will

the power of the age Karma, the sojourn (of the souls) in mundane existence (is
secured). Therefore the age-Karma (is mentioned) before the body-making Karma.
High and low family depends on condition of existence; therefore the body-
making-karma (is mentioned) before the family-determining Karma. ghArdiva

the force of the Deluding Karma destroys like the Destructive-Karmas the (real

before the deluding Karma. It is called nondestructive, because its operation is
limited to bringing about occasions for pleasure and pain. The realizing of
pleasure and pain, depends upon the soul's attention and indulgence and ennui.
If the soul is non-attentive to such occasions, and is not influenced by them,
the Feeling-Karma though operative, cannot disturb the thoughtactivity of the
soul. 5. ..............................

physical, fluid, aharaka, electric and Karmic. Here, in gatha 27 (q. v.) 15
kinds of bodies are given as the sub-classes of these 5. Thus 10 more are added
to 93 to make up 103. zrI dayevide sovadi kammaM karedi jappadi ya  /

in a machine, bird-seed (being ground takes 3 forms, husk, corn and powder); so
in the machine of (the thought-activity of) the first subsidential right-belief
the matter of wrong-belief also (becomes of) 3 kinds; and each one is
innumerably less in material Karmic molecules (than the one proceeding it).
Commentary. Subsidential right-belief is of 2 kinds. Prathamopashamasamyaktva,
the first subsidential right-belief. It may arise (1) in a soul which has never
had right-belief, by the subsidence of the 4 error-feeding Passions and Wrong-
belief, i. e., the 4 Anantanubandhi Kashayas and Mithyatva; or (2) in a soul
which has had, but has lost right-belief, by the subsidence of the above 5 and
of the 2 samyaktva mithyatva, mixed-right-and-wrong-belief, and samyaktva
Prakriti, right-belief-clouded-by-slight-wrong-belief. Dvitiyopashama-Samyaktva,
the second-subsidential-right-belief. It arises in a saint in the 7th spiritual
stage of Perfect Vows. When this saint is preparing to pass on to the 8th stage
of New Thought-activity along the line of subsidential advancement, having been
already a right-believer of the destruction-subsidence kind, he transforms the
nature of the 4 error-feeding Passions into lesser Passions, and causes the
subsidence of the 3 sub-classes of rightbelief-deluding-Karma, namely,
Mithyatya, Samyaktva Mithyatva, and Samyaktva Prakriti Mithyatva. The right-
belief of this saint is called the second-subsidential right-belief. Wrong-
belief is of three kinds, Mithyatva, Wrong-belief, Samyaktva-Mithyatva, mixed-
right-and-wrong-belief, Samyaktva Prakriti-Mithyatva, right-belief-clouded-by-
slight-wrong-belief. The matter of wrong-belief Karma, by being subjected to the
thought activity of the First-subsidential right-belief becomes of the above 3
kinds. Wrong-belief has the largest number of molecules. Mixed-right-and-wrong
belief has a number of molecules innumerably less than that. And right-belief-
clouded by-slightwrong-belief innumerably less than those of mixed-right-and
wrong-belief.

electric and karmic (bodies) with (the other) three; the electric with the
Karmic; the karmic with another karmic; (the bodies) thus combining (we get)
four, four, four, two, and one sub-classes (of the 5 bodies). Commentary. The 15
are these: 1. Physical-physical; 2. Physical-electric; 3. Physical-Karmic. 4.
Physical-electric-Karmic. 5. Fluid-fluid; 6. Fluid-electric; 7. Fluid-karmic; 8.
Fluid electric-karmic. 9. Aharaka-aharaka; 10. Aharaka-electric; 11. Aharaka-
karmic; 12. Aharaka-electric-karmic. 13. Electric-electric; 14. Electric-karmic.
15. Karmic-karmic. These 15 are the names of the sub-classes of the body-making
Karmas, by the operation of which respectively, a physical body is produced from
another physical body; an electric body from a physical body; and so on. These
15 are illustrated as follows: 1. In a Chakravarti, who has 96000 wives, his
original physical body is reserved for his chief wife. But for the others, he
produces by the operation of this Karma 95999 physical bodies. Of course the
soul remains the same, although it employs all the 96000 bodies simultaneously.
2. In a saint, in anger or compassion, the electric body which issues from the
left or right shoulder is due to the operation of this Karma. Note that although
he has got an electric body also, but the electric body which he throws forth
from his shoulders is said to be produced by the operation of his physical-
electric sub-class of body-making Karma, because the vibratory-activity of the
soul which results in the operation of this particular sub-class is produced by
the physical body mainly. Thus the Yoga or Vibratory-activity which produces the
electric body, being physical, the Karmic sub-class is called physical-electric.
Note also that these bodies

======================
 GOMMATASARA. 17 which are produced are made up of fresh molecules, and are not
divisions or offshoots of the physical, electric and Karmic bodies already
possessed by the saint. 3. At the approach of death, a Karmic body is produced
to go and sort-of-touch the place where the soul is to reincarnate. 4. At the
approach of death of a saint in compassion, both the electric and Karmic bodies
issue simultaneously for their different purposes. 5 to 8. Apply to celestial
and hellish beings. Celestial beings never travel out, in the body in which they
are born ; but they send out one or more fluid, etc. bodies by the operation of
these 4 subclasses of body-making Karmas. Note that the hellish beings merely
transform the matter of their own fluid body into another form. Their fluid
electric Karma operates in anger only. 9 to 12. Apply to the Kharaka body.
Somehow if it has not fulfilled its mission in its appointed duration, the saint
issues out another Aharaka from the previous one. This is done by the operation
of the 9th sub-class, Aharaka-aharaka. The 10th is, where an electric body is
produced from the aharaka, e. g., to protect or extricate a saint from some
trouble or difficulty. The 11th is when the saint is about to die and is in
doubt also. The 12th is where the circumstances of the 10th and 11th co-exist.
13. Electric-electric. If one electric body has failed to complete its mission
in its appointed time, then another is produced from the same. 14. When the
Karmic is produced from an electric body. 15. The Karmic body produces another
Karmic body. NalayA bAhU ya tahA NiyaMbapuTThI uro ya sIso ya  /  advaiva du

(the third hell). (The one with) five, four, and one osseous structure excepting
Sripatika, etc., also goes beyond that up to fifth, sixth and seventh hells
respectively. Commentaryo. Only beings with the highest osseous structure can
sin so deeply that they merit the tortures of the lowest or the 7th hell. That
is, they alone can go down to the 7th hell. Those with four, i.e., the first
four osseous structures, i. e. with all except Kilita and Sripatika go down to
the 6th. Those with 5,i.e., all except Sripatika, can go down to the 5th. Those
with all the 6 structures of bone can go down to the third hell. For the 6 kinds

osseous structreus appear in the women of work-region (Karma-bhumi); the first
three osseous structures are not (found in them). So it has been said by the
Conquerors. Commentary. Females of work region have only the last 3 osseous
structures, and no higher ones. Therefore they can not go beyond the 16th
heaven, as stated in Gatha 29. Only those who possess the first osseous
structure, Vajra-Vrishabha-Naracha Samhanana, can attain Liberation. Females of
work region do not possess this structure, and therefore they can not attain
Liberation from female bodies.

in Attendance (or Existence, Satta). Commentary. Under the influence of
vibratory activity, and passions, Karmic molecules are attracted to, and bound
with, a mundane soul, for a period. This is Bondage, Bandha. So long as they
remain in Bondage, without coming into operation, they are said to be in
attendance, Satta. During the period, they gradually come into operation, and
shed off. This is called their operation, Udaya. In all these changes, there
always remains a body of Karmic molecules attendant upon the soul. It is called
Satta. Satta may be roughly compared to a stream of running water. Within a
particular area of the river, the water remains more or less the same in volume,
although it is changing every moment as to the material water which is
constantly flowing away. The volume which is more or less constant is like
Satta. Of course the Karmas in Satta fall off by austerities, etc. or on
maturity. There are 148 sub-classes of attendant Karmic molecules.

The demeritorious sub-classes are in total-47+1+1+1+4+4+5 +5+20+1+1+10-100, with
reference to operation. In bondage, 2vix. mixed-right-and-wrong-belief, and
right-belief-clouded-by-slightwrong belief are excluded, as they do not bind;
and therefore the total with reference to bondage, is 98. If not taken in all
their individual sub-classes, we must exclude 16 out of the 20 sub-classes of
the 4, colour, taste, smell and touch; then we have the above totals reduced to
84 and 82 respectively. The 10 immobile, etc., are Sthavara, Sukshma, Aparyapti

Karma, 62 out of 93 of body-making Karmas, have been already described as
pudgala-vipaki. 4 of the age-class are called as Bhava vipaki, because they
operate to produce and keep the particular condition of existence of a soul. 4
Anupurvi sub-classes of body-making Karma, are termed Kshetravipakvi, because
they operate to maintain the form of the previous body, during the
transmigratory passage from one condition of existence to another. The remaining
78 mainly affect the characteristics of the soul and are hence called Jiva-
Vipaki. vedaNiyagodaghAdINekAvaraNaM tuNAmapayaDINaM  /  sattAvIsaM cede attari

the vows of control. It is only adopted when it is ascertained that the body has
become se weak that it cannot safely follow the adopted vows. Then the religious

stages and quests, as may be applicable. Commentary. Mundane souls have ever
been binding all the 8 kinds of Karmas. There is thus no beginning of bondage ;
and bondage from this point of view is called unbegun (Anadi). At each moment of
our lives we are binding fresh Karmas of one kind or the other, i.e., we bind
thos Karmas again which ceased to bind once; such bondage is with beginning, and
is called begun (Sadi). (See also gatha 123). All Karmas will remain bound for
ever to souls incapable of liberation ; this bondage is called lasting (Dhruva).
Bondage which lasts for some time only, viz. which occurs after intervals is
transient (Adhruva). ThidimaNubhAgapadesA guNapaDivaraNesu jesimukkssaa|

In (souls) advancing in (spiritual) stages, there is (in one and the same
stage), non-maximum (bondage) of those Karmas of which there is the maximum
(bondage), as regards duration (Sthiti), fruition-intensity (Anubhaga) and
molecular-density (Pradesha), (and appertaining to any of) the 4 kinds (begun,
etc). Similarly (there is) non-minimum (where there is minimum). Commentary. As
an example, take the case of a soul on the subsidential ladder. When he reaches
the 10th stage of slightest-passion, he binds the maximum fruition-intensity of
the high-family Karma and then proceeds on to the 11th, the subsided-passion
stage. There he stays a very short time, and must fall back to the 10th stage.
There he binds the non-maximum fruition-intensity of high-family Karma. This
non-maximum bondage is of the "begun" (Sadi) kind, because it has a beginning.
Again; take the case of a hellish being in the 7th hell about to acquire right-
belief. He will bind the minimum fruitionintensity of low-family determining
Karma, in the last instant of wrong-belief stage. The same soul falling from
right-belief into the wrong-belief stage binds non-minimum-fruition intensity of
lowfamily-determining Karma. This is also the "begun" (Sadi) kind. The fruition-
intensity bondage of the family-determining Karma has always been in this soul,
and is of the "unbegun" (Anadi) kind. In a soul incapable of liberation, the
Karmas remain bound forever, such bondage is called lasting (Dhruva). The
maximum fruition-intensity bondage of high-family-determining Karma which
precedes the non-maximum bondage as given above is an example of transient
(Adhruva) bondage. sammeva titthabaMdha AhAradugaM pamAdarahidesu  /  missU usa

lasts only for one Antar-muhurta, which according to some saints is too short to
carry out the 16 meditations (Shodasa Karana Bhavana) which are necessary for
the initiatory bondage of Tirthakara Karma. The beginning of the bondage of this
supreme Karma can be made only by a man, and that also near an omniscient or an
all-scripture knowing saint, because in no other surroundings can the necessary
purity of thought-activity be attained. But although thus begun in the human
condition, the bondage of Tirthakara Karma can continue in all the conditions

Commentary. With-opposite sub-classes are so called because they are in sets
mutually repugnant; the bondage of one excludes the bondage of the other. For
example, when there is bondage of pleasure-feeling, there cannot be a bondage of
pain-feeling. Sometimes ane may seem to feel both pleasure and pain, but this
feeling is merely the operation and not bondage of the pleasure and pain-feeling
Karmas; and even then the mixed feeling is only apparent, and not real ; because
attention changes from pleasure to pain so instantaneously, that although the
feelings are really successive, they seem to be simultaneous. The operation also
of pleasure and pain-feeling Karmas is successive and not simultaneous. avaro

maximum (duration of a Karma) divided by its maximum quiscence, is its
quiescence-section (AbadhaKandaka, showing the number of the variety of
durations with equal quiescence). After multiplying this by the number of
divisions of quiescence, and deducting (the product) less one, from the maximum
duration, (we obtain) the minimum (duration). Commentary, To illustrate. Let the
maximum duration of a Karma be 64, and the minimum duration 45 instants. The
intermediate durations would be of 63 to 46 instants. Let 16 be the maximum
period of . quiescence. Abadha Kandaka, 'or quiescence-section is a group of
durations, each of which is possessed of equal quiescence. In each group the
quiescence will be gradually decreased by a common difference. In order to find
out the Abadha Kandaka in a duration of 64 instants we should divide these
instants by 16, the maximum quiescence. The quotient 4 would be the number of
periods, each of equal quiescence. This group will include Karmas of duration
varying from 64 to 61 instants each one of quiescence of 16 instants, For those
with durations varying from 60 to 57, the quiescence would be of 15 instants,
taking one, as common difference. For those from 56 to 53, the quiescence will
be of 14 instants; for those from 52 to 49, it will be of 13 instants ; and for
those from 48 to 45, it will be of 12 instants. Here the numbers of divisions of
quiescence are five, (i, e., of 16, 15, 14, 13 and 12 instants). The minimum
quiescence here is of 12 instants. The namber of divisions is obtained by
applying the following rule :maximum quiescence - minimum quiescence 16-12
Common difference, +1= 1 +1-5. According to the Gatha, the minimum duration is
64-(4x5 - 1) 64-19-45. We can also find out the minimum quiescence for the
minimum duration. Minimum quiescence section begins from 48 to 45 instants. If
16 is abadha for a Karma with duration of 64 instants, what will be the Abadha
for one with 48 instants. By application 16 X 48 of Rule of Three, we get to. 12

 82 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. In one-sensed beings, the maximum duration
of wrong-belief is one Sagara, and the minimum is one Sagara minus (innumerable
part of a Palya minus one instant). The divisions of duration from maximum to
minimum having a common difference of one instant (Samaya) are equal to
innumerable part of a Palya. Now by rule of three, if innumerable parts of a
Palya are divisions of duration in bondage of wrong-belief for 343 parts, the
number of divisions for 196 parts will be 19 assuming the innumerable part of a
Palya-x. This is the number of divisions of duration from the maximum of gross
developable to the maximum of fine developables. Then the maximum duration of
fine developables will be: 1 Sagar- (1965-1. } 343 28x In the same way, we will
be the number of divisions of duration from one instant less than the maximum of

196x duration of gross undevelopable would be 1 Sagara-1 -1 -10 343 343 Thus we
should get the durations of each of 8 divisions for onesensed beings. Also the

leaving aside the human, sub-human and celestial ages, (all kinds of) duration
(bondage) of the remaining good and bad (Karmas) are bad. Commentary. Duration
of bondage is determined by intensity of passions. Passions prevent liberation ;
therefore all duration bondage is bad. Celestial, human and sub-human ages are
not bad, because they afford an opportunity of subduing and destroying passions.
Subhuman beings can reach up to the 5th stage of partial vow. Hellish beings can
attain at the most to the 4th stage of vowless rightbelief, but they cannot go
out of hell to any place where piety can be practised. In this respect, they
differ from celestial beings who are also in the 4th stage, but can move about
and perform acts of piety such as worshipping Arhats, attending upon saints, and
visit. ing Jain temples. Beings in hell always desire to get rid of their
bodies, while those in other conditions of existence are more or less

soul-vibrations, and by operation of Karmic body sub-class of body-making Karma
; and then binds the soul, for a definite duration varying with the intensity of
passions. The period between the moment of bondage and the commencement of its

the age Karma is) 100 years when (the bondage duration is) a crore of crore
Sagaras. And for the other durations, (it is) in the same proportion.
Commentary. In a year there are 360 days; in a day 30 muhurtas, and 3773 pulse-
beats in a muhurta, which consists of 48 minutes. Thus in on hundred years there
are 100 x 360x24x60x3,773:4834,07,48,40,000 pulse-beats. The quiescence for a
bondage duration of one Sagara is 4,07,48,40,000-10,00,00,00,00,00,000 of one-
pulse beat. Thus it is clear that Karmas whose bondage is of ordinary duration
begin to operate practically at once.

 88 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. . The four kinds of bondage duration are
maximum, non-maximum, non-minimum and minimum. One extreme represents the
maximum, and the other, the minimum. The spaces from the middle point to the
maximum represents the non-maximum and to the minimum, the non-minimum. The
maximum and minimum durations are extremely rare. Ordinarily the durations are
of medium types of varying length. Our ordinary passions are neither extremely
intense or mild. The corresponding bondage-duration is also of ordinary length.
The quiescence for one Sagara years' duration is roughly 25,000th part or
exactly speaking *0,00,04,07,484 of a pulse-beat. A Sagara consists of
innumerable years. Thus it is evident that if a person at the moment of birth
binds a Karma of 70 or 80 year's duration, it must begin to operate after one
Avali or winki.e., practically at once. . aMtokoDAkoDihidissa aMtomuttamAbAhA  /

maximum) to (the minimum) briefest time (Asankshepaddha, an innumerable part of
an Avali or wink). (But note that) in age (the quiescence is) not a
proportionate part of the duration, as in other Karmas). Commentary. : The age
Karma is bound at one of the eight declining-times (Apakarshana Kala), see Gatha
517 (Jiva-Kanda). The maximum age is one crore Purva years in the case of humans
in work-region

 GOMMATASARA. 89 (Karma-bhumi). So the longest quiescence possible cannot be
more than one-third of one crore of Purva years. The maximum celestial . and
hellish ages are 33 Sagaras and of humans and sub-humans of the enjoyment
regions, 3 Palyas. But the celestial and hellish brings bind their next age-
Karma 6 months, and the enjoyment region humans and sub-humans 9 months, before
death. Therefore their quiescence cannot be more than one-third of this time.

quiescence (is) one Avali, and necessarily (there) is no premature operation of
the age (Karma) for the next incarnation (in the present incarnation).
Commentary. The Avali in the Gatha is called Achalavali or fixed wink, i.e. the
minimum period of quiescence. Some matter out of the mole. cules having long
duration can be brought to operation prematurely by diminishing their duration.
Such Karmas must have a minimum quiescence of one avali before premature
operation, Udirna. AbAiNiyakammahidI Nisego du sattakammANaM  /  Aussa Nisego

 90 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. Commentary. Dripping is the number of
molecules of particular Karma which are shed is one instant. It should be known
that Karmic molecules bound at a particular instant begin to operate after
passing the quiescence. Then those molecules are distributed over all the ins -
tants of the duration minus abadha. In each instant thereafter there is a
shedding of a lesser number of molecules than in the former, by a common
difference (Chaya). Their proportion and distribution has been illustrated in
Gatha No. 5. AbAhaM bolAviya paDhamaNisegammi deya bahugaM tu| tatto visesahINaM

After passing the quiescence, the greatest (num. ber of molecules) should be
assigned to the first dripping (of the first Gunahani), (i.e., the greatest
number of molecules will be shed in the first instant of any dripping). Then
reduce (at each instant) by the common difference (Chaya) or(Nishekha) up to the
first dripping of the next Gunahani). (See note to Gatha 5). bidiye bidiyaNisege

second (Gunahani), the common difference (is) half of the common diffierence of
the first (Gunahani) and similarly in each Gunahani the common difference
(Chaya) is half of that in (the preceding one). Commentary. If the unit of
bondage be assumed as 6300 molecules, as in note to Gatha 5, and the period of
their shedding, after deducting Abadha be 48 instants, the number of molecules

creeper degree) up to an infinite part of the wood (degree) the degrees are
partially-destructive (Desha Ghati), and all (the degrees) beyond that, (aer

which do not wholly destroy the qualities of the soul. Except the deluding
Karmas, their destructive-subsidence always exists in a greater or less degree,
resulting in some quality of the soul being unobscured, while alldestructive
Karmas are those which totally obscure the quality of a soul, which can only be
exposed by their full destruction. For example, perfect knowledge-obscuring
Karma is all-destructive. Until it is destroyed, not a bit of perfect knowledge
is possible. Sensitive and scriptural knowledge-obscuring Karmas are
partiallydestructive. Their destructive-subsidence always exists in every
mundane soul; therefore each soul from one-sensed to five sensed has got some
sensitive and letterless scriptural knowledge. desotti have sammaM tatto

remaining infinite parts (of wood class and the whole of) the bone (and) the

power of fruition is separate for the mixed-right-and-wrong-belief sub-class of
the right-belief deluding Karma. The following chart shows the distribution of
the four classes of the power of fruition over the 3 sub-classes of the

The following chart shows that the harder or intenser kind of fruition always
includes the softer or milder kind; but not vice versa. For example wrong-belief

hardness of stone. This includes the hardness of bone and the maximum hardness
of wood. (2) Of the intensity represented by the hardness of bone. It includes
the maximum hardness of wood. (3) Of the intensity represented by the maximum
hardness of wood. Similarly right-belief-clouded by wrong-belief is of 2 kinds:
(1) Of the softness of the young wood. This includes the softness of a creeper.
(2) Of the softness of a creeper which necessarily excludes even the comparative
hardness of soft young-wood.

 Stone. It would be seen that the intensity of mixed-right-and-wrongbelief is
represented only by the medium hardness of wood. It will have infinite degrees

form of all these 3 sub-classes, if the wrong-believer from the 1st stage of

attains right-belief and passes on to the 4th stage. This subsidence lasts for
one Antar* muhurta and in this interval the matter of the wrong-belief-Karma
splits up into the 3 kinds of, wrong-belief, right-wrong-belief, and clouded-
right-belief. After the antar-muhurta of subsidence, the soul passes into the
stage corresponding to any of these three, which-ever may come into operation.
It is thus that although the bondage is of wrong-belief only, the operation is
of the three-subclasses. The four kinds of intensity as they are distributed in
the above 3 sub-classes have been dealt with in Gatha 181. Thus leaving these 20
aside, we are left with 27. These may be considered in two groups, 19 of wholly
destructive and 8 of partially destructive. In the 19 wholly destructive, i.e.,
in perfect knowledgeobscuring, perfect-conation-obscuring, somnambulism, deep
sleep, heavy drowsiness, sleep and drowsiness, and in the 12, i. e., error-
feeding, partial and total vow-preventing classes of the 4 passions anger,
pride, deceit and greed, there are only 3 degrees of fruition in intensity
corresponding to the hardness of stone, bone, and wood as given in the chart
below: And in the 8 partially destructive minor passions, i, e., all the nine
except male inclination, there are only 3 degrees of intensity of fruition
corresponding to stone, bone and wood as given below: Notice that in the 3
degrees of the 19, creeper is omitted ; but it is included in the 3 degrees of
the eight. A partially destructive sub-class at its lowest may have a very very
mild intensity like the softness of the creeper. But even the lowest kind of a
wholly destructive Karma in intensity is like the medium hardness of wood. The

have) like Neem, Kanjira, poison (Visha) deadly poison (Halahala). Commentary.
Of the total 148 sub-classes, only 120 are bound, i.e., all except the right-
wrong-belief, and clouded-right-belief, sub-classes of the right-belief deluding
Karma ; 5 molecular bondages, 5 interfusions, and 16 out of 20 sub-classes of
touch, taste, smell and colour. All the 120 operate, but in its operation the
wrong-belief sub-class of right-belief-deluding Karma is spilt in three parts;
therefore the bondage is of 120, but the operation is of 122. Of these 122, 47
are destructive. They are 5 knowledge-obscuring, 9 conation-obscuring, 28
deluding and 5 obstructive. The rest i.e., 75 are non-destructive. Of these 75,
42 involve merit and 33 demerit. But as all Karmas are material and matter has
always some kind of touch. taste, smell and colour, these four must be added to
these 33, thus making the demerit sub-classes 37. The degrees of fruition of the
42 merit and 37 demerit subclasses are of 3 kinds. The lowest degree of merit or

 GOMMATASARA. 105 causes are given in Jain Siddhanta, Wrong-belief, Mithyatva;
Vowlessness, Avirata; Carelessness, Pramada; Passions, Kashaya; and Virbration,
Yoga. Anadi or " Unbegun" molecules are those which never have been bound to any
soul. This can be easily understood, when we remember that molecules of other
kinds of matter are constantly being transformed into Karmic molecules, which
are obviously virgin of all bondage. Sadi or" begun" are those molecules whose
bondage has already begun, i.e., which have been bound already to some soul or
other and having been shed by that are bound again. Roughly the anonlogy is the
same as that of new and second hand clothes. eyasarIrogAhiyameyakkhettaM

second-hand Karmic matter). So it is has been said. Commentary. Jyestha-The
maximum unit of bondage is that which is produced by the maximum vibratory
activity of the soul. All begun or second-hand Karmic matter is that which has
been bound to any soul at least once. Therefore the whole of it must be included
in the total matter which has been bound to all the souls. If we suppose every
instant of their existence to have been one of activity corresponding to maximum
bondage, its maximum bondage is possible, but it is not actually maximum
bondage. This is so because every soul in every instant of its existence is not
necessarily with the maximum vibratory thought-activity. Therefore the begun or
second-hand Karmic matter must be less than the above product.

predominate all other sensations. The operation and fruition of every Karma
implies shedding of its Karmic matter. There is thus a continuous and

The matter of the total obscuring (or whollydestructive Sarva-Ghati sub-classes)
of the root-classes (i.e., of knowledge and conation obscuring and deluding
classes is) an infinite part (of the total of its class). The remain ing
infinite parts are the matter of the partially-obscuring (or destructive Desha-
Ghati sub-classes). Commentary. Although sensitive, scriptural, visual, and
mental knowledgeobscuring and ocular, non-ocular and visual conation-obscuring;
and perfect conduct-preventing 4 passions, and 8 quasi passions, subclasses are
partially-destructive, yet each of them contains some matter which fully
obscures the nature of all. Where Sarva-Ghati is operative also, one cannot have
a bit of its opposite nature, for example one-sensed beings have not got ocular
conation, because there is operation of matter of all-ocular-conation-obscuring

 112 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. Commentary. Obviously the distinction of
partially-destructive, Desha-Ghati and wholly-destructive Sarva-Ghati applies
only to the sub-classes of 4 destructive Karmas. So does also the distinction as
to the 4 degrees of intensity of fruition, as examplified by the degrees of
hardness of stone, bone, wood and creeper. The hardness of a creeper and an
infinite part of wood is confined to the partially destructive Karmas. Beyond
that there are the wholly destructive, see Gatha 180. Let 3100 be the whole
matter bound in one instant, 40 instants be the duration, Nana Gunahani -5,
Gunahani-8, than 2 Gunahani 16 and Anyonya bhastarashi - 32. Then 3100
(32-1)-100-the number of molecules in last Gunahani of stone kind of matter.
Then five Gunahanis will be 100+ 200+400+800+ 1,600. Total 3,100. Here 1,600
molecules is the number of creeper kind of partially destructive Karmas. A
little more than this 1,600, i.e., 1,600 adding something equal to infinite part
of wood kind is the total number of molecules of partially destructive Karmas.
The remaining is the number of molecules of wholly destructive Karmas.

classes (i. e., wholly and partially destructive sub-classes). The partially-
destructive matter (should be distributed) among the partially-destructive sub-
classes, but never in the other (i. e., wholly-destructive sub-classes).
Commentary. Infinite part of the molecules of any destructive Karma is the
number of wholly-destructive-matter and the remaining many parts is that of
partially-destructive matter. The molecules of whollydestructive, are to be
distributed to both sub-classes of wholly and partially-destructive, but the
partially-destructive matter should only be given to themselves.

division), Ekanta-Vriddhi (Sthana) changing-(vibratory division, Parinama Yoga
Sthana). As to divisions, each (division has) 14 kinds (according to the 14
soul-classes.) (Each one) again (is) of 3 kinds.

classes) should be known to be minimum and maximum in the first instant of the
birth of a soul after transmigration with turnings or in straight line
(respectively). Commentary. The birth-vibratory division has a duration of only
one instant namely the instant of birth which immediately follows the last
instant of transmigration. It is also the first instant of the undevelopable
condition of the soul. The vibratory activity is minimum, if the birth takes
place after three turnings in transmigration. It is maximum if the birth follows
a straight transmigration without any turning whatsoever. It should be noted
that this birth-vibratory division is with reference to the developables also,
because although they are partially developable, i. e., undevelopable in the
first instant of their birth, yet they are under operation of develop e body-
making Karma. They must become developable after an Antar-muhurta.

increasing because in every instant of its duration, there is an innumerable-
fold increase of indivisible units of degrees of increase (Avibhaga
Pratichchheda). . Its duration is from the second instant of birth up to the
last but one instant of the completion of the capacity to develope the body.

 GOMMATASARA. 183 The difference between the forces of a unit (Pradesha) of soul
which has got minimum force and of another Pradesha which has got the least
greater force than that of minimum force is called Avibhaga Pratichchheda. The
minimum force in one Fradesha if measured by this Avibhaga Pratichchheda will be
equal to innumerable times the units of universe. This minimum force is called
Varga. The collecti of such Vargas is Vargana. The soul has got Pradeshas of
minimum force which amount to innumerable basic area of universe. There fore the
same number of Vargas-Vargana. This is called first Vargana. Collection of those
Pradeshas of soul, each of which has got force greater by one Avibhaga
Pratichchheda than that of the minimum force is second Vargana; but number of
Vargas will be less in this Vargana by a common difference or Chaya, which is
found by dividing the 1st Vargana by 2 Gunahanis. In this way the third, etc.,
Varganas will be greater in force but less in number by a common difference. In
this way "innumerable part of basic area of universe" of Varganas make one first
Spardhaka. Now all such Pradeshas or Vargas as have force greater by an Avibhaga
Pratichchheda than the Pradesha or Varga in the last Vargana of the first
Spardhaka will make the first Vargana of second Spardhaka. The number of Vargas
will be less by a common difference. The following chart will show the lesser
number of Varganas in each Spardhaka and Gunahani:1st (2nd 3rd 4th 5th Gunahani.

evident because the birth vibratory division is confined to the first instant of
the birth; and an increasing vibratory division also lasts for one instant,
because there is an increase in it every instant. A changing vibratory division
lasts at least for 2 instants and its maximum duration is 8 instants.

In (the 11th stage of subsided delusion, Upshantamoha, where passion Karma
exists in a passive condition and does not operate, i. e., is) not subject to
modification, and in the 12th and 13th stages of destroyed, delusion, Kashina-

Karma and with how many molecules are bound to the soul is determined by its
vibratory activity ; how long these molecules will continue to bind the soul and
the strong or mild character of their fruition is determined by the passion
which colours that vibratory activity. In the 11th stage passions are entirely
subsided, i. e., although they exist, they settle down into non-operation. In
the 12th stage they are entirely destroyed, i. e., they

nonexistant, as binding the soul. In all these 3 stages, passion is either
entirely absent or entirely inactive. Therefore the duration and fruition
bondages which are due to passion do not arise. But in all the three stages,
vibration (Yoga) exists, therefore Karmas are created. The duration is of the
simplest and shortest kind, i. e., of one-instant only. The fruition also lasts
only for one instant and is therefore necessarily very intense and concentrated.
The nature Prakriti is also only of the pleasure-feeling class (Sata-vedaniya).
The normal duration bondage (Sthiti Bandha) is for one-antar-muhurta. This does
not take place here. Therefore it is said that there is no duration-bondage
here. In the non-vibratory omniscience, i. e., the 14th stage, there is neither
passion nor vibration and consequently there is none of the four kinds of
bondages. It should be remembered that the 14th stage is of very short duration.
It really means the transition of the perfect soul from its mundane condition to
the condition of liberation. aftvaemiem AAnzimiu ?ila asafu | tehiM asaMkhe

(of universe). And the collection (or number of) all the ultimate classes
(Prakriti) of Karmas is an innumerable times of those. Commentary. Vibratory
divisions are of three kinds, without-interval (Nirantara) and with interval
(Santara) and mixed. They are an innumerable part of basic line of universe, but
the ultimate classes of Karmas are those multiplied by innumerable times the
innumerable spatial units of the universe. It is so, because there are
innumerable kinds of thought-activities with reference to ignorance and intense
or mild passions in mundane souls. Scriptural-knowledge-obscuring sub-class
alone has many innumerable divisions, as the different kinds of knowledge due to
their destructive-subsidence is of innumerable kinds.

 GOMMATASARA." 163 Commentary. Out of 148 sub-classes of 8 Karmas only 122
operate. 26 are not taken into consideration, with reference to operation. These
26 are the following sub-classes of the body-making Karma.5 bondage (Bandhana) 5
interfusion (Sanghata), and 6 of the 20 sub-divisions of touch, taste, smell and
colour, because only one of each of these 4 operate at a time. The bondage and
interfusion subclasses are bound and operate along with the five body sub-
classes of the body-making Karma, they therefore are not counted separately. Out
of these 122, nine operate in an exceptional way. They are mentioned in Gathas
261 and the 1st half of 262. The remaining 113 are dealt with in the last part
of Gatha 262. dasa caurigi sattarasaM aha ya taha paMca ceva cauro ya  /

place at the end of the fourteen stages respectively). Commentary. In the 12th
stage of destroyed delusion, operation-cessation of 2 and 14 sub-classes is
mentioned. It means that two sub-classes cease to operate in the last but one,
and fourteen in the last instant, as given in Gatha 270. . This discription is
in accordance with the view of the saint Vrishabhacharya, the author of Maha
Dhavala which is also called Kashaya Prabhrita. paNa Navaigi sattarasaM aDa

 164 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. 264. Five, nine, one, seventeen, eight,
five, four, six, six, one, two, sixteen, thirty and twelve (cease to) operate
(from the 1st stage) to the end of the non-vibratory omniscient (i. e., the 14th
stage respectively). Commentary. This account of the operation-cessation of the
sub-classes is according to the saint Bhutabali, the author of Dhavala. The de
tailed exposition which follows is based upon this. It is worth noting that
premature-operation (Udirna) of the sub-classes also ceases in the different
stages. This premature operation-cessation is the same as the operation
cessation for the 1st 6 stages except that the human age and pleasure and pain-
feeling Karmas cease their premature-operation at the end of the sixth, although
their operation goes on further. After the 6th stage, i. e., from the 7th onward
up to the 13th the cessation of operation and premature-operation is different
in the different stages as given in the chart below. In the 14th stage there is
no premature operation. The premature-operation of the human age and the
pleasure and pain-feeling sub-classes of Karmas ceases at the end of 6th stage
of imperfect vows, because a saint with perfect vows, i. e., in the 7th and
higher stage, is not subject to accidental or other similar premature-death.
Also in the 7th and higher stages, which are stages of concentration, the soul
does not feel pleasure or pain although they exist in the form of operation of
the Karmas on their maturity. But there is no hastening of the maturity and
therefore of operation. In other words there is no premature Avipaka, but only
mature or Savipaka shedding or Nirjara of these three subclasses of Karmas in
the 7th and the higher stages. The insensibility to pleasure and pain in these
stages relates only to worldly feelings. The soul being in near touch with its
own character feels the bliss which is its own eternal attribute and which is
merely suppressed on account of the load of Karmas in Sansara.

caused by the senses. samayaSTidigo baMdho sAdassudayappigo jado tassa  /  teNa

pleasure (feeling Karma) is simultaneous with the operation of it, therefore the
operation of the pain (feeling Karma), takes the same form as the pleasure
feeling Karma. Commentary. In omniscients, pleasure-feeling Karma with highest
intensity of fruition flows in and is shed off after operation at every instant,
therefore the Karmic molecules of pain-feeling Karma of very mild fruition are
submerged in the most pleasant fruition of pleasure feeling Karma. It is a rule
that one of the two feeling Karmas can operate at one time; therefore no pain
can ever be felt by the omniscients. edeNa kAraNeNa du sAdasseva duNiraMtaro

of the pleasure-feeling Karma only; therefore the (11) sufferings which have the
pain-feeling Karma as their auxiliary cause are not found in the (omniscient)
Conqueror.

no (operation of) clouded right belief in (the stages where there is)
subsidential or destructive (rightbelief); and in (the stages where there is)
subsidential rightbelief (there do) not (operate the 5, i. e.,) the first three
migratory forms, (i. e., all except celestial) and the two assimilative (body
and limbs). Commentary. The above is explained by two supplementary Gathas* in
the Sanskrit Commentary. Souls do not die in the 3rd or mixed stage, during
vibration of the assimilative mixed with physical body, in the stages of
destructive ladder, when ascending the first part of New thought-activity in the
subsidential ladder, in the first subsidential right-belief, in the 7th hell
Mahatamah having acquired the attribute of right-belief and continuing in it.
199 But in the Sanskrit Commentary page 475, Calcutta Edition, Mishra is
translated potentially developable soul. Both the meanings seem correct, because
the soul does not die either in the 3rd stage, or in the potentially developable
condition. In this last condition the soul is really a developable soul, but the
completion of the capacity to develope fully is effected in one antar muhurta
and the condition of being potentially developable lasts within that Antar-
muhurta only. If death should occur within that Antar-muhurta, the soul would be
called not potentially developable, but completely undevelopable. And there is
no death for one Antar-muhurta for a soul with second subsidential right-belief
having come down to the 1st stage of wrong-belief and whose error-feeding
passions have already been transformed into lesser passions. Also there is no
death for a soul who is on the point of destroying the right-belief deluding
Karma but has not completely destroyed it, so long as he does not become
successful destructive-subsidential right-believer (Krit-kritya Vedaka
Samyakdrishti). All these 8 steps (are) other than (death) occasions. *

 200 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. Tu in the last line means that a soul which
has already bound celestial age-Karma and then ascends the subsidential ladder
and s up to the 11th stage, i.e., the top rung of the subsidential ladder, and
then falls down, can die while descending to the 8th and after death in
transmigration, it is in the 4th stage. In the above circumstances a soul has
the second subsidential right-belief, and so there is the operation of the
celestial migratory form only, i. e., its next birth can be only in the
celestial condition. khAiyasammo deso gara eva jado tahiM Na tiriyAU  /  ujjovaM

operation of sub-classes in the quests, should be known. (All) this is told or
described by Nemichandra, adored by Baldeo and Madhava Chandra. Commentary.
There is a slight pun upon the name Nemi Chandra. The author seems to be very
fond of it. It arises from the triple circumstances (1) that the temple in which
the Great-Gommatasara was composed at the Hill Chandragiri at Shravanabelgola,
contains a beautiful and impressive image of Lord Neminath, the 22nd
Tirthankara. A representation of this temple and of the author preaching
Gommatasara to Chamundaraya, the royal builder of the temple is given at page of
XXXVIII Dravya Sangrah, S.B.J., Vol. I-1917; (2) that the author's name also was
Nemi Chandra. As is well known, Lord Nemi Nath belonged to the clan of Yadavas
in Kathiavara, during the time of the Pandavas. He was an elder cousin of the
two brothers Baldeo and Krishna. Lord Nemi Nath was worshipped by these two
brothers. Therefore the teaching in Gommatasara may be said to be the teaching
of Lord Nemi Nath who was adored by Bal (i. e., Baldeo or Balbhadara) and
Madhava Chandra (i.e., Krishna or Narayana), as every Tirthankara always
preaches the same Jain Siddhanta or Truth. (3) And that it so chanced that our
author had a brother who also bore the name of Baldeo, and a pupil whose name
chanced to be Madhava Chandra, Traividyadeva. Both these paid great reverence to
Nemi Chandra, Siddhanta Chakravarti. Thus the Gathas of Gommatasara are said to
be by Nemi Chandra adored by Baldeo and Madhava Chandra.

 206 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. 333. In wrong belief, etc., (i. e., the
first) 3 (stages of wrong-belief, downfall and mixed. there is existence of all
the 148 sub-classes, but in the first), Tirthankara and assimilative (body and
limbs) do not co-exist; (in the 2nd) all (these 3 do not exist at any time); and
(in the 3rd) the Tirthankara (sub-class does not exist), (because) in the souls
in which these sub-classes can exist, these stages are not possible. Commentary.
Thus in one soul in the 1st stage there can be 147 or 146 at a time, in the 2nd,
145, in the 3rd 147 in existence. Although obviously 148 exist, in the first
stage, in some souls collectively at a given time, but all the 148 sub-classes
can not exist in one soul at one time. A soul in which the Tirthankara or
assimilative body and limbs is in existence is never in the 2nd stage, i. e., it
never falls down from right-belief to wrong-belief through the intervention of
the second stage, on account of the operation of any of the 4 error-feeding
passions. A soul in which the Tirthankara sub-class is in existence, can never
touch the 3rd stage, to which a soul would not ascend, in the first instance,
from the first stage, but which it may reach while falling down to it from the
4th, or during an ascent, after falling down from the 4th to the first. In other
words the soul which has already bound the Tirthankara sub-class can never have
mixed right and wrong-belief. cattArivi khettAiM AugabaMdheNa hoi sammattaM  /

 208 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. This attainment takes 3 forms, lower or
initial thoughtactivity (Adhah-Karana), new-thought-activity (ApurvaKarana), and
advanced-thought-activity (Anivritti Karana). It must be noticed that although
the last two activities give their names respectively to the 8th and 9th stages,
yet they are not confined to them. The two stages are so called, because the
conduct deluding passions are subjected to subsidence or destruction in the 8th
and 9th stages, peculiarly and especially, by the new and advanced
thoughtactivity. This will be seen to be in the fitness of things, because a
rise and entry into the 8th stage can be made only by a soul who has obtained
perfect right-belief by the subsidence or destruction of the 7 sub-classes
mentioned above, which include all the 3 sub-classes which vitiate right-belief.
The initial thought-activity or Adhah-Karana for subsidence or destruction of
the conduct-deluding passions begins and ends in the 7th stage. But these 3
thought activities also characterise the destruction of right-belief-deluding
Karma, and the transformation of the error-feeding-passions into lesser passions
in the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th stage. These are also necessary for gaining
subsidential rightbelief, at the end of the first stage, and the second
subsidential right-belief in the 7th stage, The order in which the seven sub-
classes are destroyed is as follows: After being successively subjected to the
action of the initial, the new and the advanced-thought-activity, the four
error-feeding-passions are transformed at the last instant of the advanced-
thought-activity into the 12 lesser passions. The three-thought-activities
commence action again, after an interval of one Antar-muhurta. The duration of
each of these 3 as also of the total of the three is an Antar-muhurta varying
from an Avali and 7

Antar-muhurta of this renewed advanced-thoughtactivity has elapsed, except one
numerable part of it, then in this last numerable part the wrong belief, mixed
and clouded belief sub-classes are successively destroyed. Thus it is, that the
great destructive right belief, which is a sure and certain precursor of early
Liberation is attained. 209 Thus in the 1st stage, there is existence of 148
subclasses. But Tirthankara sub-class is repugnant to the pair of assimilative
body and limbs in this stage. Therefore, actually there is the existence only of
147 or 146 in a soul at a time. But the same soul may at one time have 146, and
at some other, 147 in the first stage. For example, suppose a soul has 147 in
existence; and having transformed the two assimilative body and limbs, it binds
the hellish age, then rises to the 4th stage of vowless-right-belief, and there
binds the Tirthankara Karma and then falls back to the 1st stage for going to
the 2nd or 3rd hell, he would then have 146 in existence. In the second, none of
the above three exist, i.e., there are only 145. .In the 3rd, 147, i. e., all
the 148 except the Tirthankara exist. In the 4th, all the 148 exist, except in a
destructive right-believer who has destroyed the 7 mentioned above and has 141
only. In the 5th, 147 or 140 exist as in the 4th stage minus the hellish age. In
the 6th, there exist 146 or 139, as in 5th minus the sub-human age. In the 7th,
146 or 139, exist as in the 6th. In the 8th, in the subsidential ladder 145,
exist, i. e., all except the hellish, sub-human and celestial ages but in a
destructive right believer 138 exist and in the destructive ladder there exist
138, i. e., 145-the 7 mentioned above.

successively subsided. Commentary. But when a Karma is bound, it must remain in
that state for one Avali called Achalavali, that is for an Avali it remains
unmoving (Achala) or fixed, i. e. it has no operation, subsidence or
destruction. This is only for duration-bondage which is due to passion in which
the minimum duration is one Antar muhurta, i.e., at least one Avali and one
instant. But in the bondage merely due to vibrations, i. e., in the eleventh
stage of subsidence and twelfth stage of destruction and thirteenth stage of
vibratory omniscience there is only nominal duration of one instant, because the
Karma comes to bind and operate, and leave the soul in the same instant. Thus
there is no question of an Achalavali there.

 GOMMATASARA. . . 216 Now let us go back to the subsidence, of any of the
twenty-one passions. This subsidence is only of the Karmas bound at least one
Avali ago. What as to the matter bound within this Avali? The answer is that the
subsidence of this matter will be effected later along with the subsidence of
the matter of the other sub-classes which follow in the order given above. For
example the matter of the Achlavali of male inclination will subside along with
the subsidence of the partial and total vow-preventing anger. NirayAdisu

transforming the bound Karmie matter of one class into another class. This is
like the Visanyojana mentioned in note to Gatha 336, Visanyojana, Udvelna, and
Sankramana are alike in this, that the matter of one sub-class of Karma is
changed into that of another. But the difference is this that Visanyojana is
effected only by means of the three special thought-activity attainments(Karana-

 222 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. Commentary. Thus a soul in all four
conditions, in the wrong-belief stage and with painful thought-activity, having
no existence of Tirthankara, hellish and celestial age Karmas, has the existence
of 145. On untwisting the first two, viz., assimilative body and limbs, there is
the existence of 143; again on untwisting the clouded-right belief, it retains
142; and then on untwisting the mixed belief, the existence is of 141. This is
in their own place. In the one to four-sensed and in the earth, water, and
vegetable embodiments 145 exist, but if there is untwisting of the first two,
three, four, six or ten, then there is existence of 143, 142, 141 in the birth
instant (Utpanna Sthana), and of 139 and 135 respectively in their own place
(Sva Sthana). In the two, fire and air enbodiments, 144 exist, viz., all the 148
except the four, Tirthankara, hellish, celestial and human age. And on
untwisting the first two, three, four, six or ten, in the birth instant (Utpanna
Sthana), they have the existence of 142, 141, 140, 138, 134. On further
untwisting in their own places of the high family or of high family and the
human condition and migratory form they have existence of 133 and 131
respectively. The last two existences of 133 and 131 are also found in the birth
instant (Utpanna Sthana) of one, two, three and four-sensed and earth, water,
and vegetable embodiment. The one-sensed, etc., refer to the sense-quest and
earth, etc., to the embodiment-quest. puNNakArasajoge sAhArayamissagevi

In the physical mixed vibration, the existence is of 146 (148-2 ages). The
number varies with reference to the stages, first, second, fourth and

in the soul, with common or female inclination, on the destructive (ladder), and
in the soul with the two black and blue (thought-paints ), and also (in the soul
with) three good thought-paints, but in the stage of wrong-belief. Commentary.

soul, who has bound the next human age, and has also Tirthankara Karma in
existence, is never in this stage of wrong-belief for 6 months before death, as
the ceremonies of conception begin in the Middle Region for those 6 months. Such
a soul has the existence of 146, but is in the 4th stage for the 6 months.

 246 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. Note that, Non-bound is just one less than
the bound. There are 40 existence places and 120 divisions. The number of
divisions in each place is given below the number of existing sub-classes in
each. The numbers in five places in the first row are with reference to the
existence of Tirthankara Karma. The first place refers to all souls except sub-
humans which have no existence of Tirthankara Karma, and have existence of 146
(148-sub-human and any other age). It has 4 divisions-(1) human age current,
hellish age bound; (2) human age current, celestial age bound; (3) hellish age
current, human age bound; (4) celestial age current, human age bound. It is
noticeable that in these 4 divisions 2 same ages occur twice, and therefore in
giving the number of divisions, only two are counted. The second place has 142
(148-4 error-feeding passions, sub-human age and any other age). The third place
has 141 (142-wrong-belief). The 4th place has 140 (141-mixed belief). The 5th
place has 139 (140-clouded-belief). Each of these four places has got 2
divisions only(1) human age current, hellish age bound; (2) human age current,
celestial age bound. As to five places of non-bound age Karma of the first row,
the number is the same as in bound places minus bound-age Karma; but the
divisions in each of the first two of 145 and 141, are three having regard to
current hellish, human and celestial ages. The third place of 140 has one
division of current human age. The 4th place of 139 has 3 divisions havia regard
to current hellish, human or celestial age. A human who has begun destruction of
deluding Karma, but has not completed it, can die and be born in hellish or
celestial condition. The fifth place of 138 (viz. 148 minus 3 ages, and 7 Karmas
preventing right-belief) has also 3 divisions with reference to current human,
celestial and hellish ages. The soul with 138 is a destructive right-believer
with Tirthankara Karma. He can either be a Tirthankara in current human age, in
cases where he has bound Tirthankara Karma, with celebrations of at most three
auspicious occasions of adoption of aus. terity, perfect knowledge and
liberation; or he may go to heaven or hell and become Tirthankara in third birth
as a man. Till six months before the expiry of their life-period, he will remain
with-out bondage of human age; and will have existence of 138 sub-classes. - The
five places of the second row have Tirthankara Karma less in each. In the 2
places of 145 and 141 there are twelve divisions in each, like that in the place
of 145 in wrong belief stage, but only five are counted (vide (3.) B. 2 in chart
of wrong-belief). Each of the 3rd and 4th places of 140 and 139 has 4 divisions,
i. e., current

 :: GOMMATASARA.... 247 human age, and bound all the four ages. Here only 3 are
counted ving current human age and bound human age. The 5th place 138 has 7
divisions (1) current hellish, and bound human age; (2) current sub-human and
bound celestial age; (3) current human and bound hellish age; (4) current human
and bound sub-human age: (5) both current and bound human age; (6) current human
and bound celestial age; (7) current celestial and bound human age. Leaving out
divisions which contain the samage, as current and bound and the same two ages
again, only four divisions are counted. Each of the first two places of non-
boundage in the second row 144 and 140, has 4 divisions, with reference to
current four ages. The third place of 139 has only one division of current human
age. Each of the 4th and 5th places of 138 and 137 has each four divisions with
reference to current four ages. All the ten places of the third row have the
same number of divisions as the ten places of the first row, while the ten
places of the fourth row have the same 37 divisions as ten places of the second
row. Thus there are altogether 120 divisions in 40 different places of existence
of Karma sub-classes in vowless right-belief stage. desatiyesuvi evaM bhaMgA

144 and 140 of second row, and in bound places of 141 and 137 and non-bound
places of 140 and 136 in the fourth row each has two divisions, bound ones have
1) current human age and bound celestial age. (2) Current sub-human age and

remaining bound places in partial vow and all 20 bound places in the 6th and 7th

 GOMMATASARA, 249 Commentary. The 8th stage of subsidential ladder has 12
bondage and 12 nonbondage places with twenty four divisions, in all, as shown in

twenty four places and twenty four divisions) in the (other) three (stages of)
subsidential (ladder). For the new-thought-activity of destructive ladder, make
four rows. (The first row having one place) with all (148 sub-classes) minus ten
(viz. three ages, except the current one, and four error-feeding passions and
three deluding Karmas), Deduct (from each) zero, one(viz., Tirthankara), four
(viz. the four assimilative), and five (viz. Tirthankara and the four
assimilative for places in the four rows). 138 Commentary. 137 184 Each of the 4
places have only one division of current 133 human age and there are four
divisions, in all.

existence of female (sex in the two places); (and the soul rising with)
operation of common (sex inclination), first destroys the female (sex),
(therefore there) is existence of common (sex in the aforesaid two places).
Commentary. Thus there are thirty six places and thirty eight divisions in
advanced thought-activity stage of destructive ladder and there are 24 places
and 24 divisions in this stage of subsidential ladder. 62 divisions in all are
thus possible in the 9th stage. The common or feminine inclination is destroyed
in the 4th or 5th place of each row just as the soul rises in the destructive
ladder with male or female inclination or with common inclination. It is with
reference to the second and fourth row, where Tirthankara sub-class does not .
exist that we have the two extra divisions. aNiyaTTicarimaThANA cattArivi

four rows) of the advanced thought-activity (stage should be taken) in (the 10th

have 4 places of 102, 101, 98, and 97 with 4 divisions there). The places of
(the 12th stage) of destructive (delusion) are the same after deducting .one
(greed up to last but one instant; and four places again after deducting
therefrom) two (i. e., sleep and drowsiness). (Thus we have eight places in the
12th stage having 101, 100, 97, 96, 99, 98, 95 and 94. The divisions are eight).

 252 THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS. Commentary. In all the four stages of
destructive ladder, and the two stages of omniscience, there is only current
human age, and no age-Karma is bound; because the soul will be liberated from
the same body. Therefore there can be only one division in each place having
reference to non-bondage of age-Karma. te codasaparihINA jogissa jogicarimagevi

vibratory (omniscient) till the last (but the two instants ). ( Thus we have 4
places having 85, 84, 81 and 80 sub-classes with 4 divisions for thirteenth and
fourteenth stages, till the last but two instants). (In the last but one instant
of the 14th stage, the first) two places will (each) be reduced by seventy-two,
(and the other) two, (places) by sixty-eight (viz., 72 minus four assimilative).
( Thus there are four places of 13, 12, 13, 12. As two of the four places
contain the same number of sub-classes, only two places should be counted) . (
At the end of the 14th stage, there are only two places of 13 and 12), each with
two divisions, (because some have operation of pain-bearing and others of
pleasure-bearing feeling Karma in each. Thus there are two places with four
divisions). rAtthi aNaM utrasamage khavagApuvvaM khavittu aTThA ya  /  pacchA

 GOMMATASARA. 391. There is no existence of (four) error-feeding (passions) in
subsidential ladder, and those (in the 9th stage) of destructive ( ladder) first
destroy eight (partial vow-preventing and total vow-preventing passions) and
then destroy the (other) sixteen (sub-classes). This has been said by some
(saints). 253 Commentary. According to the view in the above Gatha four of
bondage and four of non-bondage places will be deducted from the 24 mentioned
above. The subsidentials will then have only 16 places instead of 24. ayi

thirty-eight plus 20, i.e. 58), twenty, sixteen, eight, four, and eight
(divisions respectively in fourteen stages). Commentary. The difference between
what has been said here and described before is as follows: (1) In downfall
stage, 12 places have been said before, here there is one less, as a soul with
second subsidential rigat-belief having a bondage of celestial age coming down
to downfall stage will not die here. (2) In the eighth stage, 24 places have
been described before in subsidential ladder. Only 16 have been mentioned here,
by deducting 8 places having reference to existence of four error-f passions in
bondage, and non-bondage, each. There are four places in the destructive ladder.
Thus 20 have been mentioned here. (3) In the 9th stage only 16 instead of the 24
mentioned before have been taken for subsidential ladder and after adding the 36
mentioned above and the four mentioned here in connection with absence of
deceit, there are altogether 56 places and 53 divisions. (4) In the 10th stage,
only 16 instead of 24 as above for subsidential and 4 for destructive; 20 places
in all, have been mentioned. (5) In the 11th stage, only 16 instead of 24 have
been mentioned. evaM sattahANaM savittharaM variNayaM mae sammaM  /  jo paDhai
